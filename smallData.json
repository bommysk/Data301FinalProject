I'm a guy, I've got a short haircut.  Nothing fancy -- short on the sides and back, an inch on top.  Pretty easy in MY opinion.\n\nThe stylist \"didn't do\" clipper cuts, even though that's what I requested for the sides -- it's really the only way to get the sides short.  Instead she went with scissors and a comb.  Took 3x longer, and the result was a mess....a big strip of hair down the back that was probably twice the length of the sides.  \n\nThe top wasn't even and was kind of a mess.

Every stylist would inevitably refuse to do it because red was \"too unpredictable.\"  Dejected, I was debating on going back to my last salon where I had less than a positive experience or trying this place based on a male friend's recommendation.\n\nI was hesitant, knowing that men and women's hair were different.  I wanted much more than a $26 trim and the relationship a woman has with her stylist is quite personal.  \n\nJennie got me in her chair and told me she'd not only color my hair red but was really excited about doing it!!  She needed minimal direction and gave me the edgy cut I wanted in record time (I was in and out in less than 2hrs).  She was upbeat, perky and really a great person to be around.  My hair looks fantastic and I started getting compliments from other women getting their hair done before I even left the salon.  \n\nAt $145, it was the most I've ever spent for a cut and color (pretip) and I've been getting it colored professionally for a while.  But honestly, for the entire experience, it was well worth it.  Jennie knows what she's doing with color, products, a straight razor and shows a great knowledge of current styles.  \n\nIf you're looking for a new salon, I would absolutely recommend this location.  The staff was very friendly and chatty and offered tea, water, wine or coffee.  Nothing but positive experiences to be had here! \n\nOh and a GREAT perk: you can book your appointment online anytime.  I work nights right now and 2am was the only spare time I had to book.  It was so easy!  While I believe they take walk ins, I would definitely recommend booking a consultation first since its so easy to do it from their website.", "type": "review", "business_id": "qicXiOKmN-GFubYuiPAFKg"}

You will get your pocketbook emptied at most places.

Half of the restaurant is glass and overlooks the city.  Most of the tables line the windows.\n\nThe food itself was decent.  I had their \"spots\", which was a crusted and pan fried white fish. It was good but was it $20 good? Not so much.  The salad that accompanies the meal had a housemade balsamic vinaigrette to die for. I think I could've just eaten the balsamic vinaigrette for dinner and been good. Other diners in our party had the carbonara (proclaimed good, but not great), a shrimp with clams and garlic butter sauce pasta dish (proclaimed very tasty), and the house special that night (a pork roast that had some bold flavors that were too bold per the person who had it). We had two ice teas, a cosmo, and two beers.\n\nTotal for the meal (with tax) was $116. \n\nI can't say I had warm fuzzies for the place. It wasn't great. It wasn't bad. It just was.

In a restaurant that is more or less in a food court. Being surrounded chinese joints, mexican burrito places, and the philly cheese steak place.\n\nWhile I think it would be a solid bet for dinner as well --- that's not how I see this place positioned.

The portions were large and the prices were very reasonable. I ordered the Virginia Spots with crab meat and broccoli and loved it! The house salad and balsamic vinegarette were very tasty...I would eat salads more often if I had that dressing at home. We ordered the zucchini fritti and the waitress was nice enough to warn us that the portions were huge and recommended a half order. My boyfriend ordered the crab cakes and green beans, he liked his meal too...I didn't try them but his green beans came with roasted red peppers and they looked so good! \nThe bad: I always order a vodka and cranberry when I go to restaurants, and I've never had any automatically assume I wanted top shelf (grey goose)...they've either asked what kind of vodka or given me the standard, so my drink almost cost as much as my meal. Not the biggest deal though.  I enjoyed my drinks.  The big downfall was the parking. The restaurant said that they validated the parking garage under the building, and the hostess gave us a ticket for the parking garage as soon as we walked in.  No explanation with it, so we assumed it was pretty straight forward, put it in the machine and go.  However, when we were leaving and put the ticket in the machine, it wouldn't accept it, so the attendant came over to help us.  We explained our situation, and he said we owed $15? If we had to pay any additional fees, one would think that either the restaurant or the ticket would have said so.  My boyfriend only had a $20, and the attendant didn't have any change of course so we paid $20 to park in that garage. One of the selling points of that restaurant when friends told us about it was that they validate parking. Had I known that was going to happen, we would have parked at one of the cheaper garages around the block.

Growing up in Latrobe I had become accustomed to mediocre, chain pizza. Not until I was about 12 did I get my first taste of super thin, floppy, extra cheesy, greasier than normal pizza. This was the stuff I dreamed of. My dad took me here prior to my first ever Pens game. The Villa holds a soft spot in his heart as well due to the many many post work nights he spent here slugging beers and eating pizza with friends. \n\nFast forward 13 years and now I am the one working downtown, slugging beers and eating post work pizza. Unfortunately though, Villa Reale has become so expensive that treating it as a weekly stop is a bit unreasonable. While the pizza is still super thin, floppy, extra cheesy, greasier than normal, I have trouble paying $15 for a slice of pepperoni, a coke, and a side salad. On another occasion my dad requested to come here as his payment for helping me move. A medium calzone, a slice of pepperoni, and two cokes ran me $35. \n\nVilla Reale, please come to your senses and adjust your prices.

Since the move from NY, I'd been really craving some quality, New York-style pizza, and hadn't had a ton of luck finding any (although the search introduced me to some excellent \"Pittsburgh-style\" pizza joints, so I'm not complaining.)  \n\nVilla Reale really came through.\n\nI loved that you could order a slice with basically whatever toppings you wanted (I'm used to being at the mercy of whatever \"slice\" pie has been languishing under a heat lamp for 3 hours).  I ordered a pepperoni and sausage slice, and the small feast that was presented to me did not disappoint.  The slice was huge, the pepperoni crispy, the sauce really balanced (not too sweet, not too garlicy), the cheese fresh and delicious and the crust...oh man...thin and crisp on the outside, pillowy soft on the inside.  One slice was perfect to fill me up for lunch, too.  \n\nFull disclosure: while the wait staff is so friendly, they do get overwhelmingly busy at lunch.  We went to the place at 11:00 so we could sit at a table (if you want to dine-in and order a slice during lunch, you can only sit at the counter, not a table, after 11:30) and by 11:30 the place was standing room only.  My coworkers informed me that somehow, their pizzas are even better when ordered by the pie (hard for me to fathom) and also that their hoagies are delicious, so I'm sure I'll be trying one of those next time.  \n\nIt's not the most inexpensive pizza joint downtown (I think my slice ended up being $4-$4.50) but if you're a recovering Noo Yawker like me looking to fulfill some culinary nostalgia, this is your place.", "type": "review", "business_id": "l-OmDgEd4QkZpyXVpkp2yA"}

My friends and family remain fascinated by the new patterns she twists my hair into...and I'm a guy, so I like the attention! ;^)\n\nTerry typically twists my hair initially, then finishes them off as three-part braids, so that they will hold longer. I personally like this look, because it appears more \"full\", and yet still has some life to it.. She's so good, no one ever guesses that I'm gradually thinning on top, and versatile enough that we've switched this look up from time to time.\n\nIn professional settings, my hair is always stylish enough to merit compliments, never so \"busy\" that people do double-takes.\n\nTerry is really phenomenal.

These two stylists are experts with all textures of hair, and I've recommended them both for years and continue to do so.\n\nSo, if you think you can handle getting compliments as soon as you leave the hair salon, go to SALON NUVO and ask for Terry (or Chris).

As the 500 degree plate came out with the glorious aroma of perfectly cooked meat sizzling in butter, I knew I was not only in for something special, but a livelong love.\n\nRuth's Chris is a franchise and the setting in different cities can be quite variable.  The Philadelphia Ruth's Chris is right next to the Academy of Music with gas lamps lighting Broad St.  The Boston's Ruth's Chris is in old city hall with a beautiful ceiling 2 stories up in the bar area.  Pittsburgh's Ruth's Chris cannot boast such extravagance in their setting, but the food is equally outstanding in all their restaurants.\n\nMy recent venture to Ruth's Chris was with 4 other young men in a \"guys night out.\"  I brought several bottles of wine (you have to love the PA Chairman's selection) because Ruth's Chris amazingly allows you to do this.  We started with the seared Ahi tuna.  It was raw, thick, and delicious.  Actually, it kind of tasted like steak.\n\nWe each went on to get various cuts of meat.  I personally rolled with my favorite:  NY Strip, medium rare (correctly done with a blood red center), extra butter.  The extra butter is key.  If you're going to roll with a decadent feast of steak, might as well pull out all the stops.  It was brought out absolutely perfect and delicious.  The table also shared the excellent huge family-style sides of asparagus and garlic mashed potatoes.\n\nOur server was extremely gracious.  She opened and decanted a couple of our bigger bottles as soon as we sat down to give them time to breathe.  They arranged for us to have a cab-van at the end of our meal to take us to our next location.  \n\nIf I was really searching for something negative to say, it's that I wish that the Pittsburgh Ruth's Chris was in a more extravagant setting like some bigger cities.  However, since the main menu is exactly the same, Ruth's Chris is forever my go-to location for a perfect steak dinner.", "type": "review", "business_id": "0FgwBx7pgmNdUtsd_T8UYQ"}

I come here about 4 times a year. When I do go I prepare myself by not eating red meat several days prior to going. On the day of I make sure to eat a normal but smaller breakfast. No bagels as they occupy too much space. I arrive a bit later, I am a bit hungrier and the staff that remains are long time regulars who know me but are also there to earn a living and make my visit worthwhile. I always order a filet, medium with mushrooms. I don't drink when go, the beef is too good to have my senses misdirected. The plate and filet arrive in minutes, the plate is sizzling at 500 degrees, if by chance there is too much red in the meat I cut a piece and sizzle it right there on the plate. I recently tried the salmon on a recommendation from the owner and was wowed how good it was. Panko crumbs and lemon, great stuff. \nI always feel they go the extra mile for me but the food and service are always top notch i can assume this is the standard.", "type": "review", "business_id": "0FgwBx7pgmNdUtsd_T8UYQ"}

If the rating was strictly based on food, I'd go with 5, easily. But, it's based on service, too, which is why I had to knock one off. Here's the deal...\n\nI love Morton's. Its old-school interior and no-gimmicks shtick is awesome. Plus, of course, the food is fantastic. However, I wanted to branch out, and Ruth's Chris had some great reviews, so I utilized Yelp's oh-so-convenient Open Table reservation feature, and scored a table for two on a Saturday night. \n\nOur reservation was for 8:30. We arrived right on the dot, but were told to go to the bar and wait. So, my boyfriend and I both got cocktails -- he had Glenlivet, which is obvs hard to mess up, and I got the Peachy Pear-tini, which was delish. And then, we waited. And waited. Around 9, our table was ready. \n\nOur waitress was Kristen, and she was fantastic. Very attentive, friendly, witty, and knowledgeable about the food. Here's our food rundown:\n\n- Barbequed shrimp app: I initially thought was BBQ sauce + shrimp, but it ain't. It's succulent li'l shrimp in a deliciously garlicky, white wine-infused sauce with a cayenne kick. Kristen suggested that we dip the bread in the sauce after the shrimp were gone, and we happily took her up on that. \n\n-Ruth's chopped salad: Holy crap. The most memorable salad of my life. I rarely rave about salads. In fact, I think this is the first time I ever have in my life. But, this salad was incredible! It has crispy onion strings on top, hearts of palm (which I love), and this amazing lemon-basil dressing, among other delicious things. So awesome.\n\n- Filet mignon: My boyfriend and I both opted for the filet. I got mine with extra butter, he got his with a bleu cheese crust. Mine was phenomenal. The sizzling butter really adds an extra dimension of flavor that puts it beyond Morton's. My boyfriend found the bleu cheese to be a li'l too generous, and he wound up scraping some off, but still enjoyed it.\n\n- Broccoli au gratin: Again, phenomenal. I've never enjoyed broccoli so much. Granted, it was swimming in bubbling, gooey cheese...\n\n- Potatoes lyonnaise: We took a risk here, as many people rave about the garlic mashed potatoes, and we saw mountains of them carried past our table. But, it paid off big-time. These were, hands-down, the BEST lyonnaise potatoes EVER. Pamela's has nothing on these. Every mouthful was a medley of crusty brown potatoes and caramelized onion goodness. I dream about these potatoes.\n\nSo, based on that experience, we went back again the next Saturday. Different waitress, same food (literally, we ordered exactly the same items, 'cause they were so damn good). I don't remember the waitress' name that we had the second time, but we waited longer for food to appear, were checked on far less, she took the cocktail shaker with my extra martini in it before I'd gotten to pour it in my glass, our steaks were not done correctly (he got my medium-rare, I got his medium-well), and it took forever to get the check. I really think it ruins the experience when you're done eating and ready to go, and you're just sitting there, drumming your fingers, looking around the dining room and wondering, \"Where the hell is the waitress with our check?\" \n\nThat said, we will definitely be back. We'll just request to be seated in Kristen's section! :)", "type": "review", "business_id": "0FgwBx7pgmNdUtsd_T8UYQ"}

The legendary steakhouse is supposedly the final word in steak outside of NYC and Texas. If this is the case then my oh my how the mighty have fallen. I have been to several Ruth's Chris locations around the PA, NY, and NJ area, but the one here in Market Square is truly a disappointment. \n\nWhen I go to a real steakhouse, like Peter Luger's, or the Old Homestead, or any other Ruth's Chris location I have visited, I expect to pay top dollar for top dollar steaks. I will never complain about the price so long as I feel as if the quality and quantity of food as well as the dining experience I recieve is fair in proportion to what I pay. The cheapest steak in the M2 Ruth's Chris will run you about thirty dollars. Normally, this would not be a problem had the establishment lived up to its reputation. Sadly, however, they did not.\n\nFirst, let's start with the decor. Ruth's Chris is a chain, first and foremost. That being said all locations are going to have the same basic look: old wood, magnum wine bottles, white tableclothes and red walls. I expect this sort of thing in a steakhouse. They are the last holdouts from the old industrial capitalist era. I feel as if I were to walk in, I might see Andrew Carneghie or John Rockefeller sitting at the bar discussing how unffair anti-trust legislation is.\n\nContinuing with the bar, Ruth's Chris offers a fantastic wine selection that has a pleasant mixture of affordable, yet quality, choices as well as a few that would cost me six months' rent. They also have a decent coctail menu, no doubt created by a corporate mixologist, that I must say is good. My girlfriend is not a fan because she can actually taste the alcohol in the majority of the concoctions, but I think that is a good thing. The bar is about the only place where you get the quality for the money you are spending.\n\nThe most dissappointing aspect about my last few visits have been the steaks. Ruth's Chris is known for basting their steaks in butter, which I do like. Fat is deliscious and that is proof enough for me that we are meant to eat it. This is where the goodness ends. On my second to last visit, a member of my party was served a rancid steak. The server tried to say it was dry-aged, but dry-aging does not produce a metallic, green beef. On my most recent visit, I was served a filet mignon that was tough. I have no idea how they were able to serve a tough portion of the least used muscle on the cow, but they did.\n\nAll of this brings me back to the service. I understand you are working in a fine dining, expensive steakhouse. I get that you throw down $300 plust dollar checks thirty or so times a night. I get that you are on first name basis with the Pens, Bucs, and Steelers that call themselves your regulars. That does not make me chop liver. I feel that if you are not wearing at least $3,000 worth of clothes or accessories, the staff will basically ignore you.\n\nThe saving grace to the place would be the bar and decor I already mentioned, and the sides. Ruth's Chris, like most fine dining establishments runs an a la carte menu. The sides are usually very very good. I like the sauteed mushrooms, sauteed spinache, lyonaise potatoes, macaroni and cheese, and the wedge salad.\n\nAll in all, this place gets a two in my book. I think that this is kind of sad given the fact that I was hoping to give them a five, but the quality of the food compared to what you pay just is not up to standard. For $250 I can feed and booze six friends at my house instead of me and my girlfriend at Ruth's Chris.", "type": "review", "business_id": "0FgwBx7pgmNdUtsd_T8UYQ"}

Heavy cafe curtains and shutters cover the windows - closed in to the point that you don't realize half the restaurant is glass! It could just as easily be in a basement.

We were greeted by friendly staff and walked through the room that smelled of wonderful steak. We were seated and our waiter was very friendly and knowledgeable. Everything was fine until we got the food which was disappointing. I ordered off the special menu and had the corn chowder, a filet and lobster tail, a side of creamed spinach and dessert for about $55. My husband had the cowboy ribeye for $65, the scallops to start and a side of brussel sprouts. \n\nThe corn chowder was ok but not very hot. The scallops which came recommended were ok but they were on a pesto sauce which was simply too overpowering for the delicate scallop. We used the pesto to dip the bread in. The steaks came and were both overcooked. They were supposed to be medium rare but my filet was well done and his was more like medium. We should have complained but we decided to just eat bc we didn't want to wait and didn't think that they would be less well done since they come on a scorching hot plate. My husband liked the brussel sprouts but my creamed spinach was not hot and was stringy. \n\nAgain, the food was mediocre but the staff was extremely friendly. I booked on opentable and told them that it was his birthday and they did bring him a complimentary dessert. I prefer Morton's, Ditkas and Peter Luger's.", "type": "review", "business_id": "0FgwBx7pgmNdUtsd_T8UYQ"}

It also could have been my imagination, but I think I got a quizzical look for getting something other than pizza. It's not an attractive place to hang out, so it's no wonder delivery is their thing.\n\nI got a falafel wrap with a side of fries. The veggies on the wrap were lackluster, though the falafel and pita were acceptable. I was given a little cup of some kind of sauce, but what I really would have liked on it was hummus. I wouldn't be surprised if they'd provide it if asked, but it's not there by default.\n\nIt was all kind of meh to me.

We were planning to get take out and have a picnic at the concert, but alas, rainy weather struck (surprise, surprise!), so we ended up having dinner here before heading over to Heinz Hall, where the concert had been relocated due to the weather.\n\nCM and I ordered a medium Moroccan spiced chicken and plum pizza to share ($14.99), and our friends each ordered pide, with one ordering the Ephesus, and the other ordering the soujcuk ($9.49 each).  Both CM and I enjoyed the complex medley of flavors and textures comprising the chicken/plum pizza, which was complemented by a cup of seemingly homemade ranch sauce served with the pizza.  The plums were dried, and weren't overwhelmingly sweet or fleshy, and lent the perfect hint of sweetness to the savoriness of the chicken and the spicy kick of the sauce.  The sliced nuts (almonds, I believe) were also a nice touch, and the size was more than enough for the two of us.  My only major criticism was that the myriad of toppings made the pizza a bit unwieldy to eat, and often fell off as we ate it.\n\nThe pide were rather long and thin in profile, and were each topped by a pepper.  I didn't try the Ephesus version, which is topped with ground beef, due to my aversion for that meat.  I did try a slice of the sojcuk pide, however, which is topped with cheese and Turkish pepperoni.  While the pepperoni were different in flavor than traditional pepperoni, the overall effect was reminiscent of eating traditional pizza that just happens to be long and thin.  I didn't try the greens that came with the pide, but they seemed similar to those used to top the chicken/plum pizza, and our friends weren't fans of the sauce, which they found rather oily and flavorless.  However, I did try the tzatziki sauce served with their pide, which was thick and had a great cucumber-yogurt zip.\n\nOne important thing to note is that Ephesus seems to have relocated since several of the previous reviews were written--they are now located at street level on 4th Ave., and the space is actually rather nicely decorated for a pizza parlor.  Having said that, judging from the amount of phone calls and runs of the delivery guy, the majority of their business still seems to consist of delivery.  Overall, we were pleased with our experience, and would return to try some of their other offerings.", "type": "review", "business_id": "nBl_NeArpL08MpoghDiA_A"}

The flat top grill is behind the counter in the front and the back of Peppi's has a couple tables and booths with Steelers paraphernalia on the walls.\n\nI wasn't too hungry so I ended up ordering \"The Phantom\", which was a cheese steak with grilled mushrooms, onions, and a fried egg.  My companions got a mushroom cheese steak and the famed #7, the \"RoethlisBurger\" itself.  All the sandwiches come with the basic fixin's of lettuce tomato, etc. and are a foot long.\n\nThe Phantom was a little smaller than I expected, but the flavors of the ingredients in the sandwich melded together wonderfully.  My only complaint is that I would have liked a little more meat.  After some searching online, apparently all their steak subs only have a quarter pound of steak.\n\nFor some reason based on the picture of the RoethlisBurger in the window outside we thought it was going to be a lot bigger.  I guess camera angles can be deceiving.  It's a mix of chopped burger and sausage with American cheese and a fried egg.\n\nOverall I would have liked it a bit more if the sandwiches were served a bit faster (some people who ordered after us got their food first) and a bit more meat.\n\nAnyways, I'm definitely going to be back to try the RoethlisBurger since now I view it as a potentially tasty sandwich as opposed to just a ridiculously impossible food challenge.", "type": "review", "business_id": "J011r7mUV1QhgLJ7GkrtMw"}

Really, Peppi's uses the best bread for their sandwiches and that, in my opinion, is what makes a sandwich.  \n\nLocated in the Strip District, you can shop your extra sandwich weight off after lunch by visiting any of a few dozen specialty shops in the historic district.  \n\nYinz'll love it!", "type": "review", "business_id": "J011r7mUV1QhgLJ7GkrtMw"}

The rest of the restaurant is composed of a number of different tables and booths, lots of wood and earthy colors and has some decorations consisting of Pittsburgh sports and Peppi's regulars.\n\nBoth my father and I decided to get a regular Italian hoagie on this day and they were brought to our table within 10 minutes of us ordering.  The sandwich itself looked pretty good and consisted of genoa salami, rosa salami, capacola and provolone cheese all on a nice bun that was just short of a foot.  I also decided to go with the lettuce, onion and dressing that was offered to me but said no to the tomato. Overall I thought that the taste of my sub was pretty good although I wouldn't have guessed that there was two kinds of salami and some capicola in it.  The bread may have been my favorite part of the sandwich as it seemed to be rather fresh.  I could also see some people complaining about the bread to filling ratio here as there seemed to be a lot more bread than filling but personally I was ok with it.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.

He adores this place. We usually go to the one on the North Side (their back yard area is adorable!) but they were closed on the particular day we were planning to make a visit, which led us to the Strip. The seating is limited, so on a busy day, you may not be able to get a table. My mom, dad, boyfriend and I were able to find a table easily when we visited. My mom and I decided to split the Joey Porter \"Bella\" hoagie (steak, portabella mushrooms, swiss cheese and horseradish sauce) and added fried onions, lettuce and tomato to our hoagie. We also ordered onion rings and French fries as well. My dad ordered the Italian hoagie and my boyfriend ordered the New Yorker, which is his favorite.\n\nMy mom and I really enjoyed our hoagie, although we did find there to be a lot of bread on the sandwich. The bread was fresh and delicious, but made the sandwich extremely filling. The horseradish sauce on the sandwich was delicious and not very spicy. The onion rings were fresh and yummy and the fries were fresh cut! My mom and dad were first timers and really enjoyed their food. \n\nOne important thing to mention- the service was amazing. The man who took the orders was very patient with my family, while we tried to figure out what we wanted. He gave us helpful suggestions and was overall very friendly. At the end of our meal, he thanked us for stopping in, which was really nice.\n\nOverall, I am not as obsessed with Peppi's as my boyfriend is, but I definitely enjoy their food.

The hotel itself is still beautiful and the food is above average.  All solid four stars.  I was a bit disappointed initially with some of the pre-arrangements.  In the past I was able to have a complimentary room and the fee waived for the coat check girl.  Friday night because the party was a bit smaller than the last they only discounted the room and charged full fee for coat check/ carving station/ etc.  Now, with that being said the service was over the top 5+++ stars from start to finish.  I get there and am running a bit late. I ask the bellboy Eric how long for a shoe shine, he states its pretty much an overnight service.  I tell him I'm in a rush.  He runs downstairs and shines them himself, done in 30 minutes.  While I'm waiting my contact for the night Ryan Hunt sends up a cheese dish with a bottle of above average wine.  The party goes off without a hitch, great staff, good food, some discounted wines and good premium open bar.  After the hotel party we are walking outside and run into Eric (bellboy) again ask for directions to other club, instead of giving them to us he walks us to the club.  One of the girls wanted cigarettes and instead of directing her to the store.  He ran down and bought them for her and brought them back.  Btw, did I mention he was done working for the night and just did this off the clock.  The next morning I get a ring around 11 am in the hotel room and its the bellboy bringing up aspirin and bottled water from a long night prior.  Everything about this place is three to four stars.  My main pet peeves are the valet cost ($17 and $25 overnight).  There lack of flexibility in food/bev minimums, but the service is over the top great or at least my contacts were over the top great with service.  You can't go wrong in Pittsburgh for an event at this spot.", "type": "review", "business_id": "A38wziZJdYoijhC5S6uWCQ"}

Where is the large flat panel HD screens with HD programming?\n- TV service is satellite based. Lots of interference and loss of signal during my stay due to thunderstorms.

It took about 6 hours for the room to cool off. Once it cooled off though - it was fine.\n\nPros\n- Beds were comfy - still not as firm as I would prefer - but better than some of the places I've stayed recently.\n- Pillows were substantial.

During my stay, I was expecting a FedEx delivery; when I checked the tracking number online to see where my package was, I discovered the hotel had rejected the package. Calls to the Fedex and then to the front desk and the package's sender were made and several hours later, the doorman arrived with the package. Oops - I guess it is a good idea to check before simply rejecting a delivery. To the hotel's credit, the manager did call and offer to send up an amenity or bottle of champagne for the mix-up and the delay of my departure by several hours. I thanked her but declined; several minutes later, hotel security was banging on the door asking me why I had not vacated the room.

Easy walk across the bridge and along the river straight to the field (just under a mile).  The area of the hotel felt very safe and we walked everywhere in the evenings with no issue.  Great service and the rooms are very nice, we requested a high floor with a corner room that was extremely spacious and provided amazing views of the rivers and stadiums.  We flew in for the weekend and with the location of the hotel, had no need for a rental car, walked everywhere.  The Port Authority runs a bus from the airport for $3.75 that drops off a block and a half from the hotel, we took it on the way to the hotel but opted for a cab on the way back because the bus gets packed and it was a pain with luggage.  Cab is about $40 each way but much less hassle.

Not knowing much about Pittsburgh I read some reviews and settled in on the Renaissance for this special weekend...and was not disappointed. \n\nThe focus of our trip was a Cirque Du Soleil show at the Petersen Complex but I wanted to be central to everything so we could explore the town. The Renaissance is well located downtown. It is a short walk to Market Square, the Cultural District, PNC Park, Heinz Field and the light rail which take you to Station Square and the inclines. \n\nThe architecture of the building and lobby really was a draw for me. I love the old turn of the century style with the large arch facing the river. The lobby was a spacious cathedral ceiling-ed area with contemporary styled furnishings. You definitely felt like you were stepping into a hip upscale hotel.\n\nWe were permitted to check in about an hour early without any problem. I had requested extra pillows and a high floor with a river view. Both of these requests were accommodated. We were placed in a huge corner room with incredible view of the North Shore and Allegheny River. If it were baseball season, I could've watched a Pirates game from the room. \n\nThe room was what I would expect out of a 4 star hotel. The bed and pillows were perhaps the most comfortable I've ever slept in...and I usually prefer a firm bed. The bed was just soft enough while still being firm. The linens were soft and inviting. The bathroom amenities were Aveda and high quality. The shower had good strong water pressure. We were provided a K Cup like coffee machine in room and an iPod dock. Being that we were in a corner room, there were windows all around so light poured in. However there were curtains provided to block out enough sunlight and prevent prying eyes. Free wifi that was actually quite fast was a huge plus. There is a mini bar in the room which we did not use but seemed relatively reasonable...for a hotel mini bar. There is a convenience store across the street and a drug store and liquor store a block over so no need to frequent the mini bar unless you plan poorly. \n\nI did not eat or drink at the hotel however I was very tempted. The bar downstairs, the Braddock, has an incredible bourbon and scotch selection, as well as a well rounded menu. There were tons of a places to eat nearby so we wandered the area. There is a Primanti's within a 5 minute walk in Market Square as well as number of ethnic eateries on the same block as the hotel. The area surrounding the hotel is very walkable, however be warned that outside of the restaurants, everything in downtown Pittsburgh is closed by 9pm. \n\nWe parked our car across the street at the public garage and left it there in favor of cabs. We parked from about 1pm on Friday until 2pm Sunday for less than $20. The staff was helpful whenever we needed them. My wife had a cold and ran through a box of tissues every 12 hours. The staff provided extra boxes for us. Housekeeping was efficient and seamless. There was always a doorman out front and was happy to direct us accordingly or find us a cab if needed. Another small thing I noticed was that the elevators were lightning quick. Even on the 9th floor we never had to wait more than a minute for one. \n\nOverall I was very pleased with my stay at the Renaissance. The hotel and staff really helped make my wife's birthday weekend special by providing great service and accommodating all of our requests. This was my first trip to Pittsburgh and likely not my last so I will be returning to and recommending the Renaissance Pittsburgh.", "type": "review", "business_id": "A38wziZJdYoijhC5S6uWCQ"}

The staff is friendly and super quick. The hotel rooms have high ceilings, really comfortable beds and furniture. Flat screen TV and good choice of channel selections.

It is super convenient and won't break your budget. \n\nOverall I was really happy with my stay, I did get a good deal from Priceline and that made it worth even more since I got a discounted rate. 200+ for a room is a bit much for me but for a 4 star hotel its reasonable.

First there is free Internet at the hotel which is a great for hotel guest. Not only that its free computer use in the business center and printing is free. I emailed a 3 page document to myself so that I could print it. I was SHOCKED when the front desk staff told me the computer usage and printing was free. Most hotels charge $5/minute for computer usage and $1/per page. So having a free service like this for hotel guest........AWESOME!!!!\n\nOverall, it's a great hotel, absolute beautiful lobby and bar area.

The lobby vaults several stories to a Brobdingnagian fuchsia light fixture and is flanked by the elevator bay and a grand split staircase.  Marble columns stand sentry over banks of lounge furniture and a modest, tucked away bar.\n\nCheck-in was a breeze, and service remained friendly and efficient throughout our stay.  We requested a room on the top floor and were ecstatic to pull back the curtains to reveal amazing views overlooking the Allegheny, PNC Park and Heinz Field, with a direct sightline to Point State Park and the convergence of the three rivers.

We already had dinner reservations and show tickets, we just had to find a hotel room. The Renaissance Hotel is literally next door to the Byham Theatre where we had show tickets. I walked in and there was a wedding on the iconic stairs in the foyer! It was so beautiful with guests not only seated on the lobby space but also in the balconies on the second floor. I came in just as the ceremony was finishing. and when they were pronounced husband and wife, those in the balcony threw flower petals upon the couple. The hotel handled those like myself who were not part of the wedding very professionally so the ceremony would not be disturbed, but still service incoming guests. \n\nCheck in was very swift as my husband went to the restaurant to meet our dinner reservation while I checked into the hotel. I was able to take the luggage to the room and return to the restaurant a couple blocks away without even being late. I really liked the makeup mirror since I have to take off my glasses to apply my makeup.\n\nWe had dinner and enjoyed our show. We got out of the show and went to the bar for a late night bite and a drink. We got there at 10:45pm and waited and waited. At 11:04, a blonde waitress finally came to our table after delivering food to another table. We asked to see a menu, but was informed that the kitchen had closed at 11pm. We finished the drinks we had ordered, but had to pay the bartender because the waitress had left for the night. The bartender was a gentleman as I had two bills stuck together when I paid him and he found us outside to return the other one. We had to go across the street to another establishment to get something to eat.\n\nOther than the snafu in the bar, all the staff from check in to check out were very nice and professional. The room was very clean and comfortable. As the need comes up, I will probably choose this hotel when I need to stay Downtown again. It is so close to PNC Park across the Clemente Bridge and it is in the heart of the Cultural District, so all the theaters are very close by. It is also close to public transit so you can get anywhere in Pittsburgh from that spot without having to go too far.", "type": "review", "business_id": "A38wziZJdYoijhC5S6uWCQ"}

The Renaissance is a beautiful hotel in an ideal location of Pittsburg. I was in hotel heaven when I walked into the lobby. It looked expensive and well taken care of. The customer service at check in was spot on. Laura (Lori?) was incredibly friendly and seemed genuinely happy we had chosen the Renaissance for our stay. She saw we booked our hotel through Priceline, and that didn't even affect her demeanor. She asked us a few questions about why we were in town and made me feel like I picked the right place to stay at. She then informed my husband and me that she happened to have a complimentary upgrade to a corner junior suite available. I didn't even ask, which is what made this even more wonderful. She confidently told us that we would love the room. \n\nWow! That room was insanely amazing. Laura was right! Panoramic views of the city, river, bridges and two stadiums. I felt so special having this upgrade and couldn't have asked for a better room. It was great watching the sunset with the option of looking out of any of the 7 windows in the room. The room d\u00e9cor was classy, modern and the bed was super comfy. I made sure to let Laura know that this really exceeded our expectations. \n\nThe reason my experience wasn't five stars was because of the room service. Ever since I was little, I have loved to order room service. It's just something I have to do. My first call in to room service was for a bottle of wine. I was quoted a 30 minute wait, which was reasonable to me. It took about 20 minutes, which I was pleased about. I signed my bill and added my tip. When the gentleman left, I was looking over my bill and thought it seemed really high. I completely didn't realize that a 20% gratuity was already included on top of the room service fee. I had tipped him $5 already, so he made out with $10 in tips. I felt really silly after that and tried to justify in my head why spending $43 on a $27 order was okay. My husband made me feel better by saying it is vacation, don't stress about it. \n\nThe next morning I really was craving a croissant and a beverage. I asked if they had croissants a la carte, which they did. The gal said she could have my order in 15 minutes, but probably less. Wow, that's great, I thought. However, don't overpromise and under deliver. If you are going to claim it will be 15 minutes or less, then I am expecting that. After 30 minutes of waiting, I finally called only to hear the lady tell me my food was on the way. When it arrived, it was the saddest looking croissants I've ever seen. They gave me two mini, stale croissants. I took a picture and couldn't stop laughing about how tiny they were. They obviously were not fresh either.", "type": "review", "business_id": "A38wziZJdYoijhC5S6uWCQ"}

Seems like a hotel of a bygone era.\n\nBut...\n\nValet is a mess.  Located on a two lane street with no pull-off, one must be lucky or patient to be able to pull up to the curb.  We came in on a busy Friday, but I knew it would be busy (it's a summer weekend) so why are there not more valets?\n\nAs I returned both Friday and Saturday.  I had to park the car, exit and stand there, waiting for someone to take my keys.   Friday it was about five minutes. I had to make sure I locked it myself, since the valet simply came and took my keys and stuck them on the rack.  I had to point my car to him.  Didn't really trust what was happening among the chaos.  \n\n\nSaturday upon return.  There was no valet in sight.  I parked, exited, waited.. and waited and waited.  Finally a guy comes running across the street and nearly snatched the keys from my hand, as if I was keeping HIM from taking MY keys.  \n\nCheck-in: I mingled in with a wedding party and other weekenders.  Again, a busy weekend (summer weekend and a wedding and Pirates in town) yet only two desks are working for check-in (the third was off with the wedding planner).  Took about 15 minutes to get to the desk and two minute check-in.   I understand the big wedding, but we're paying guests, too.\n\nThe room was huge.  King bed, nice sized bathroom.  But very very cold.  No matter the setting, it remained freezing.\n\nIf you request a river view be prepared and forewarned.  We were neither.  River view means stadium view and with a game going on, means lights, noise from departing crowed and that loud obnoxious so-called music from the plastic bucket-banging guy, the pirate Santa and some other keyboard playing dude, all trying to get a few bucks from the departing crowd... until well after 11 PM.\n\nYes, for some 11 is not late.  However, we rise with the sun for work during the week, so we do the same all weekend.  \n\nDid I mention the noise from the ballroom right below us?  Party Friday night, wedding reception Saturday night.  At least Friday, the noise abated about 9 PM.  Saturday it's 10:32 and the party still thumping right below us.  (picture that annoying bass thumping car that you drive by, but instead it cruises right with you ... all night.)\nCouldn't really enjoy watching a movie, reading has been a challenge.\n\nCalled desk manager who said the party was supposed to have ended at 10 P.M. and he was going to check on it.  Thirty minutes later, nothing.  He said he'd \"adjust our rate.\"  He said he didn't understand our room placement and blamed \"being busy\" as a reason we were stuck in this room.  \n\nI understand there's an expected level of noise and light in a city, but had there been any indication of such, I'd have been sure to request a room on a higher floor and away from the river.  No notes on the room selection and not even a mention at check-in.  I guess being sold out, some guests get screwed.  Of course, by the time we figure it out, we can't request another room since we're in bed already and the hotel seems sold out soooo....\n\nOh that wedding?  In the main lobby Saturday afternoon.  So that beautiful lobby that might have been a joy to sit in and read and enjoy a coffee?  Off limits.  \n\nMostly, I\"m annoyed by room selection.  A peaceful relaxing stay it isn't.    For the rate we are paying, I expected a much more comfortable and relaxing stay.  \n\nI will not stay here again. \n\nBeware and be warned.\n\nUpdate 8/29/15:  the reception ended at 11 P.M.  Night manager adjusted our rate and comped a day of valet.  Acceptable, but won't risk those issues again at the rate they charge", "type": "review", "business_id": "A38wziZJdYoijhC5S6uWCQ"}

I brought my husband here for an early Christmas gift to see the Raiders @ Steelers football game (he likes the Raiders).  We were originally booked at Mansions on Fifth Saturday and later decided to book an extra night Friday so we could have a long weekend in town.  I booked Friday for the Renaissance.  Luckily for us, we had a mixup with the booking when we booked through a third party at the Mansions on Fifth for that Saturday and Booking.com ended up coming through with the win by helping us get booked for Friday night as well at Renaissance in a very nice room!  So we ended up staying at the same hotel both nights and it was just a few blocks from the Heinz field.  Both rooms we stayed in that weekend were beautiful, had large windows, and views of the river and baseball field.  The second night's room was definitely much larger, more windows (on two sides of the room since we were on a corner) and had an AHHHH-MAZING view of the river, baseball stadium, and football stadium.  Honestly, the rooms and decor in the hotel (including the marble lobby) really made this hotel stand out.  The service was great too.  We didn't end up getting room service since we wanted to try out restaurants in town but the service at the front desk was great.  I could not recommend this hotel more if you are staying in Pittsburgh, whether for a sports event or a show (there were so many theatres in that area including one attached to the hotel).  We listened to other reviewers and didn't do valet.  I called the hotel a week before asking about parking and they told me about the much cheaper city parking garage literally across the street from the hotel entrance, so we did that.  It was very cheap and we never used the car while staying there so that helped.  We walked to the strip district (also a mile away) to eat and there are a ton of restaurants nearby, including in the market.", "type": "review", "business_id": "A38wziZJdYoijhC5S6uWCQ"}

There is a large glass walk way over the main convention floor which makes for great people-watching or trying to track down somebody on the floor (hope they're wearing something bright!).\n\nI especially liked how the lighting would adjust based on how much natural light was being let in from the roof windows.  On a bright day, the convention center doesn't use artificial lights.  But when it gets too cloudy, the lights kick in.  So if half the floor is sunny and the other half isn't, only half of the lights come on.  Hardly noticable, but absolutely appreciated.\n\nBus loading/unloading area is very convenient - especially in a city that gets weather as cold as Pittsburgh.  (you don't want to be out in that cold breeze for long!)\n\nI also liked having a walkway directly connecting to the Westin.  Very convenient to not have to go outside to get to the conference.  There's also a decent restaurant, The Original Fish Market, attached to the hotel for those meals that aren't provided by your conference.\n\nThe one annoying thing I did notice was elevator service.  Very slow.  We walked over from the 2nd floor of the westin, had to take the elevator up one floor, walk across the glass bridge, and then go down the escalator to get to the main floor.  Kind of a backwards way of doing it...Plus, one of the 2 elevators from the 2nd floor sky bridge broke down for part of a day, which made handling the crowds from the conference pretty tough.  And for some reason they wouldn't let us walk the 1 flight of stairs down to the Sky Bridge.\n\nBut all in all, a very pleasant experience.  If you're looking for a good place to have a conference, I'd recommend taking a look at Pittsburgh.", "type": "review", "business_id": "z4cguIVh7jL9tTPf5EqRcA"}

However, there are some good things to be said about this one. First is the enclosed walkway between the Westin and the Convention Center. If you're staying at the Westin, this walkway is great for a rainy day or if you don't wish to go out into a hot, humid outdoors. In the convention center, the corridors and halls are spacious. There are quite a number of well-maintained restrooms. On one side of the convention center, the balcony overlooking the Allegheny River offers a great view and a chance to get some air.\n\nDownsides: The connection between the Westin walkway and the convention center is a slow elevator, which you have to take one level up/down. This problem could've been solved by having the walkway be one level higher from the 3rd floor of the Westin. Parking is expensive in this area.

It's also convenient to several of the downtown hotels, such as the Westin, Renaissance, and Hotel Monaco, as well as many restaurants along nearby Penn Ave.\n\nOverall, I had an enjoyable time as a guest at the convention center for ISEF, and am happy that I finally received the opportunity to see the interior.  I hope to return for another event to check it out again soon!", "type": "review", "business_id": "z4cguIVh7jL9tTPf5EqRcA"}

Granted, November is still usually a little early for snow, but looking at the weather forecast a week before the conference and seeing at least 3 days of snow did not exactly make my day!\n\nBooking my stay at the Westin Convention Center however, made things SO much easier.  They've got a covered sky-bridge directly connecting to the convention center from the 2nd floor.  No need to even put on a heavy jacket to go to your conference.  Everyone else is coming from around the city and bundled up and then has to carry their coats around all day (or check them if the conference is well staffed enough to offer this).  But being connected to the Convention Center I could just stroll across the bridge and right into my sessions.\n\nRooms were well appointed.  Beds were comfortable and the double showerheads were fantastic!  Toiletries were a little sparse.  ABSOLUTELY loved the free wi-fi.  So many full service hotels are charging for this these days and it is a HUGE pet peeve of mine to pay for a more expensive hotel and then to pay for Internet access on top of that.\n\nMy issue with my hotel room (don't know if it is true for all) was noise.  I was close to the elevator, but the door seemed particularly thin as I often heard people walking back and forth down the hall and talking.  I was also able to hear various building noises like running water, etc.  The walls between rooms seemed to be thick enough because I didn't hear other people talking or their TVs (or maybe there just weren't people staying in the rooms to either side).\n\nI enjoyed their room service breakfast menu.  They had a nice offering of healthy alternatives including granola, fresh fruit, yogurt, etc.  Delivery times were pretty spot on and the attendants were friendly and efficient.\n\nAnother big plus for the hotel is that it is connected to the Original Fish Market.  Good sushi, GREAT clam chowder and some other delicious fare.  There's access into the restaurant from the hotel's lobby and it is open until 1am for those late arriving West Coast travelers.", "type": "review", "business_id": "bWWrrsPWuoHuAGUCgH8Tyg"}

Close to all major attractions and never more than a couple blocks or a short cab ride away.  The green program was a first for me.  It was a little annoying in that the light in the bathroom kept turning off because I kept forgetting to stick my key card in the light switch.  The funniest aspect of their \"green\" program was the dual shower heads. There is a sign in the shower that reads something along the lines of \"we have provided two shower heads for your comfort. However one remains off to save water unless you turn it on.\"  Now... I don't know about you but I feel if they are trying to achieve some level of green why even bother to put an extra shower head in?  Not to mention if there is a second shower head available to use, I'm certainly not going to pass on it in order to save some water. I know it's not very supportive of going green but come on! \nThe next time I'm in the burgh, the Westin is where I'm staying.

I get it...if you dont change the sheets you save on water, detergent, labor, $, $, $, $$$$$......\n\nI'm not an idiot. I know all this 'environmental' garbage is a bunch of moneymaking ideas dreamt up by some suits. Some are laudable like requiring a keycard to turn the lights on, but get real...they're offering people $5 off their next visit if they don't have their bed remade between nights. This is a hotel....why not suggest saving me $5 if you padlock the bathroom door? About as logical. Hotels = Bed with fresh sheets every night.  By the way, they obviously discontinued the minibar fridge because the power goes out when you leave the room. So why not take the fridges out of the room? Very amateurish to leave them sitting in rooms.\n\nThe hot tub/pool facilities are the kind where you have to sign in, show your key, and walk all the way through the locker rooms before you can enter the pool area that looks like it's a Mexican hotel in the 80's. Not the greatest. I don't care to look at old man ass on my way to the hot tub.\n\nThe location is good for catching a game downtown or for a night on the town.

And unlikely to be that significant relative to bigger decisions like using energy-efficient machines to wash the sheets, having quality insulation to save on heating and cooling, and so on.  Maybe the Westin does these things too, I don't know, but it seemed like the little annoyances in the room were more of a marketing gimmick than a substantive step.

I had their brunch twice during my stay and then had all sorts of complications with using my debit card. There were charges that were just incorrect on the bill which took me a couple of days and couple of phonecalls to different departments within the hotel to clear up. That was really inconvenient and a hard way to leave after having a pretty nice stay other than being sick. The staff were all friendly and helpful and the I enjoyed the layout of the room and the double headed shower. \nI took them up on the 'Go Green option\" and took about 1500 starpoints with me because of this!", "type": "review", "business_id": "bWWrrsPWuoHuAGUCgH8Tyg"}

Theres a couple of restaurants and I counted like three lounges after walking round a bit but none that caught my attention.  Teh hotel itself is ok not that super clean like the Aloft hotels.  The hallway carpets were stained and my bathroom was clean but outdated.  At least the bed was comfy and free of bedbugs(I check for that as soon as i enter the room a pet peeve of mine).  It's huge so whenever your trying to talk to someone at check in theres always a line.  Next time I will probably look for its sister hotel Aloft because this seems to be the better out one among the sheraton,westin and Aloft.

Although the hotel was very comfortable and in a good location, we could hear every noise from the hallway and adjacent rooms (including the bathroom). I was sitting up in bed reading, and every time the people next door closed a drawer in their bureau the whole headboard would shake.\n\nParking was also expensive. We needed to use the car several times during our stay, so we had to valet park, which was over $20/day (plus tips each time we picked up or dropped off the car).\n\nThe coffee shop attached to the hotel is just OK. The breakfast/lunch place was not very good. You will probably have to venture a bit to find affordable and good quality food (other than the hotel restaurant, which I can't comment on because we did not eat there given the high prices).\n\nOne perk--the hotel does offer free internet, but it is a low bandwidth version. We didn't need the internet for work or anything so it was hard to justify paying for the high speed, so we used the free version. It gets the job done for email and web browsing, but it does not stream videos well.\n\nThe bed was comfortable and the shower head was very good. I agree with other reviewers that the amenities were not as nice as I have seen in other Westins--no bathrobe, room service menu not as good, staff not quite as helpful. Also, because it is a green hotel, they will be a little stingy about replenishing your towels and toiletries. If you have a lot of people in your room or for some other reason require extra supplies, be sure to request that. We came back after housekeeping to find that they had given us a half-full bottle of shampoo to replace the one we had used. Not sure if they had just gotten that from someone else's room (gross!) or it had just spilled and they didn't want to waste it. They also failed to replace our in-room coffee and tea supply so we had to call and ask for more.\n\nAll in all, we definitely would not pay full price to stay here, but might consider it again if there was another great deal.", "type": "review", "business_id": "bWWrrsPWuoHuAGUCgH8Tyg"}

However, after arriving and seeing the room I was instantly relieved and happy with my decision. The room was clean, the beds were comfortable, and the view was an excellent 25th floor view of the Strip District below. On top of this, the staff were all very kind and courteous, and were more than willing to call cabs for us as well. \n\nMy biggest complaints about the Westin really all surround the bathroom. Although very clean, I was annoyed with the fact that the shower made this crazy noise whenever it was on which sounded like somebody gargling at sonic boom levels. In addition, there seemed to be no fan, which meant if you got a hot shower, you couldn't see anything in the mirror without wiping it off. Lastly, there was no lock! I mean, yeah, we managed without, but it is still reassuring to know that a lock stands between your privacy and three of your friends.\n\nOverall however, I was extremely pleased with my visit and would gladly return to the Westin again if I ever find myself in Pittsburgh.", "type": "review", "business_id": "bWWrrsPWuoHuAGUCgH8Tyg"}

My name is Ben. The name of the Steelers' quarterback (beloved perhaps even more in 2007 than he is today) is also Ben.

I figured she'd just tell me if she happened to have a few suggestions.\n\nSome people, it seems, just like a challenge.\n\nWhen I saw her that evening, Monica had walked up to the Strip District to canvas all the tchotchkie-mongers and tourist traps.

I gave it to my mom.\"\n\nSome people, it seems, just like a challenge.\n\nThat's when Monica called up her friend's mom out of the blue and asked if she still had the sign, and whether it had any sentimental value. No, it doesn't, why do you ask? Well, you see, a guest at my hotel asked if I...\n\nNext time I saw Monica, she had (after finishing her shift at the most popular convention hotel in the city) driven across town to the house of a friend's mom to retrieve the precious artifact.\n\nHere's a photo of her handing it to me. http://j.mp/BenAtWork\n\nAnd when I offered to pay her what she had once paid at the store, she wouldn't take a dime.\n\nAnd when I offered to pay her for the gas she'd burned driving across town, she wouldn't take a dime.\n\nI assume, based on the letter I wrote to the hotel's general manager and copied to corporate (back in November 2007), that she has since been promoted far higher than the front desk.

The front desk staff seem very helpful, but I have not really had many interactions aside from the check in & out processes. \n\nConnected to the convention center if you're traveling for an event there - can be convenient in the winter months since there's no need to walk outside. \n\nThe gym seems amazing. They now have a program where they'll even lend you workout clothing (there may be a small fee?) and shoes! If you're traveling by plan and have limited packing space this could be a life saver!\n\nOne thing that really burns me is the internet. It's \"free\" but when you log in, you'll see there are actually 4 or 5 different options. I have a feeling that if you're not paying you're getting lower bandwidth. Annoying. Would do 3.5 stars if I could.", "type": "review", "business_id": "bWWrrsPWuoHuAGUCgH8Tyg"}

We booked the hotel at a great rate on Hotwire.  Knowing fully well what we were getting ourselves into by perusing their website (what's in the neighborhood, price of parking, restaurants in the hotel, amenities, etc.), we were a little bit afraid that since the hotel was next to the convention center, that perhaps the hotel stay would feel too \"corporate.\"\n\nBut, this was not the case at all.  We felt so at home in this room.  We were on a high level floor (Starwood Preferred), and our large hotel window overlooked the rivers and the ballparks.  We even got to see fireworks the night we arrived!  I had called ahead to let the hotel know that my husband and I also were coincidentally celebrating our anniversary that weekend, so we were welcomed by a complimentary bottle of champagne and a plate of chocolate covered strawberries.  SOOO delicious, and SO good after a long day of flying across country.\n\nThe hotel charges $24/night for valet, which was worth it.  Self-parking is only a few dollars cheaper every night, but it really saved the long haul of luggage and having to walk with tired feet coming home late every night.  And the valet crew was outstanding.\n\nAnother perk is that there are two restaurants in the hotel.  One of them closes late every night, so there was no lack of food or drink any minute of our stay.  The additional bonus is that Downtown Pittsburgh is pretty hopping and busy, and being so close to many great restaurants and theaters, there is no shortage to all the fun and interesting things within walking distance of the Westin.\n\nAnd, to me, the best thing of all of the bed!  It was one of the best beds I have EVER slept in, and I unusually was able to get right to sleep once in bed, and I stayed asleep.  Oh, man, I'm still dreaming about it!\n\nIn the end, loved the hotel.  Would stay in again if the rate was right.", "type": "review", "business_id": "bWWrrsPWuoHuAGUCgH8Tyg"}

Anyway, it was $5 and we didn't have a problem walking 5 minutes to/from the car. \n\nCheck in was easy, and the lady at the desk had some great suggestions as to where to buy some Steeler gear.\n\nThe very best thing about the room - the king size bed. Amazing. It was probably the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in. The memory foam pillow top really made it incredible. We have an old double bed at home, so I'm probably a little biased.\n\nThe room had an energy saving option by placing the room key in a slot in the wall. We never tried it, so if you don't like it at least know that you don't HAVE to use it.\n\nThe shower had a neat dual-head feature. It would hit your head and straight on your back if you wanted.

I was in town attending a conference at the convention center so along with how great everything looked, you couldn't beat the location. \n\nHowever, I had the absolute worst hotel experience at the Pittsburgh Westin. I am a Starwood Preferred Guest member and up until now have had great experiences, but this one was so bad it really makes me question the integrity of the brand and I am hesitant to stay at another Starwood establishment. \n\nEven tonight as I try to log into my SPG to see if my points for being \"conservative\" with the room were updated, I can't logon to the site as \"The system is temporarily unavailable.\" I should also note I have photographs of everything, because I couldn't believe how bad the stay was. \n\n1. The terrible experience happened before I even arrived. When I googled the hotel, accusations of bed bugs appeared on both Yelp.com and Bedbegregistry.com - and the hotel had yet to take the time to respond. A simple detail that if someone was paying attention they would be able to resolve. \n\n2. I arrived at the hotel after a 7+ hour drive only to find out that the bathroom in my hotel room was broken. After two calls to Guest Services, about 30 minutes later a maintenance man came by, and it took him about 15 minutes to fix it. So a total of 45 minutes before I could use the rest room after arriving. I had suggested to Guest Services on the second call that they move me to a new room and it was awkwardly laughed off. \n\n3. After using the restroom (finally!) I noticed the tub was dirty and there was mold on the top of the shower by the rod and on top and inside the mini-fridge. The mold was \"new\" so it could have easily been wiped off and taken care of if the room was being properly clean and attention to detail was paid. The fact that the hotel lacked the ability for such simple house keeping was surprising. \n\n4. The paint in various places of the room was chipping and some of the furniture, most notably the side table were knicked and scratched badly. \n\n5. Because of the bed bug reviews, I stripped the sheets to look for evidence. I did not find any, but did become aware of many brown and black tar stains on the sheets that were tucked in to the mattress. \n\n6. I begrudgingly ordered room service because of how late it was by the time I got settled. I ordered the Turkey BLT with lemon aioli and arugula salad. Instead I got cold, what-seemed-like-day-old deli meat, burnt bacon with a thin, thin layer of mayo, not aioli. The arugula salad did not have 1 piece of arugula - it was mixed greens with shredded carrots instead. When you read the description and look at what I actually received, it is very, very disappointing. \n\n7. The coffee pot in my room leaked all off, wetting the sugar, napkins, etc. \n\n8. They charged the wrong credit card after both myself and my office manager telling several different people which card to charge. I had booked the room on a corporate card, and my office manager had believed she straightened everything out at the front desk that they were to charge the card on file because I would not have the corporate card with me. The first thing I was asked by the front desk was for a credit card. After I explained the situation to the front desk, they insisted that the card on file would be charged and they just needed my card for \"incidentals\" - after back and fourth I gave in and gave them my card, assured it would not be charged. Then when I checked out two days later, I once again confirmed that they would charge the card on file and they still charged the wrong one.  Fast forward to the following week when I notice the charges, I called the billing department and someone has still yet to return my call. I am being charged interest on this card for their mistake. \n\nThis was an absolute terrible experience and I am very disappointed at the Westin and Starwood Hotels for their obvious lack of pride and detail with this hotel.", "type": "review", "business_id": "bWWrrsPWuoHuAGUCgH8Tyg"}

The hotel was very nice all around.  Efficient , friendly staff and genuinely hospitable.  The rooms were in good condition and well-maintained.  \n\nSo were looking forward to returning for a woodworking symposium at the Lawrence Convention Center.\n\nI'd say lots was the same but some of the changes were irritating and so to be fair, the negatives first (ending on a high note).\n\nFor the game, a room. For this time, we had a King suite.  19th floor.  View okay but not great as advertised but hey, you're not there to sit in the hotel all day, right? :-)\n\nWell I had booked a corner suite but there was a bit of an issue with my profile on SPG and so they were \"de-feathering\" the room and it was taking forever. So I said, another corner suite was fine.  Except it wasn't.  It was a suite alright, but in the living area where one would expect a sofa, sitting area and TV, etc?  There sat a 4 top dining table with a hole in the middle. Turns out that lots of business travelers like this arrangement for meetings and all the suites below the 11th floor have this.  \n\nSO LOOK OUT before you book, people!  :-)\n\nBut seriously it wasn't a huge deal as they were more than happy to move me. And they did - to a complimentary upgrade King Suite that you could a tech startup in.  Very spacious, with dual closets, very nice sitting area with couch and two comfy chairs, two huge picture windows about the size of patio sliders.  A vanity area outside the (smallish) bathroom.\n\nAbout that bathroom. A couple things bug me when I travel.  One, is that some downtown hotels don't have a fan/vent in the bathroom, and so the mirror fogs up big time.  Not a huge deal and I use the hair dryer so I can see, but really? can't they do something?\n\nThe other thing is this:  I hate rain shower heads. I'm an old dude, I like my water pressure, not a rain forest gently wafting over me. I want velocity!  Hit me with that H20!  And yes, I know that we need to conserve water, but I have a seriously great low flow shower head at home and it cost 20 bucks on Amazon.  Sheesh!\n\nAnother gripe:  There were exactly two places to recharge a device in the entire suite, and both were at a side table about 12 feet from the bed (and only halfway across the room)!\n\nNow, between us we have 5 devices to charge including phones. I use mine for my alarm and like it right there.  So really, can't we have a retrofit so grown folk can charge their whatsits?\n\n\nFinally, the elevators. What?  How can that be an issue? Well, since our last visit, they installed a software/hardware package that eliminates the buttons inside the elevator. Instead, there is a touch screen at each floor.  One selects the destination, and the screen lights up with a large number telling you which elevator. \n\nWhich SUCKS.  I'm sure they're using some kind of load-management software to optimize elevator use, and I'm sure that the goal is more efficient utilization and less latency.  Well it ain't makin' it.  You wait and wait and wait.  Then sometimes - if you're like me - you forget which elevator you were supposed to take.\n\nI did find that, it seems that if you go press all the screens with your floor and perhaps those above, the software sensed increased demand and sent an elevator quicker.  Hacking an elevator. Who'd a thought it?\n\nNow to the good:\n\nThe staff were super friendly, warm and helpful.  So when I asked, they found a power strip and a 25' orange extension cord and I ran it over to the bed along the wall.  Sort of the Clampetts come to city with my cord running all over the room. Nonetheless, we had power to our devices.\n\nThe room was otherwise nice and quiet.  Did I mention that it was large? \n\nThe hotel restaurants are good. Penn Grille is more relaxed overall and Bill's is more of a \"joint\" but the burgers are great, as are the nachos.  The service in both is excellent and the staff are unfailingly friendly - really hospitable the way we mean it here in the south.\n\nThe hotel is attached to the Lawrence Convention Center, which was nice as it rained some each day. We made it to the various events high and dry.\n\nI would say that the high point of the hotel is without question the attentiveness, courtesy and genuine friendliness of the hotel staff.  Not that fake, I'm polite but really looking down on you courtesy that we've experienced at the Ritz in Chicago (which I reviewed last year).\n\nIn fact, if this hotel was sited next to the Ritz, and the price was the same, I'd choose the Westin, hands down. And given that the rooms were less than half that of the Ritz, that's a good indicator of how well we were treated. \n\nMy wife tipped the housekeeping lady $300 because she was so nice. What else can I tell you?  Stay there.\n\nAnd Pittsburgh, you are an awesome town. Good people, beautiful views, and a good nightlife too.", "type": "review", "business_id": "bWWrrsPWuoHuAGUCgH8Tyg"}

You are not \"stuck\" using just a rain water shower head. You do have the option to switch to the regular shower head with the twist of the hand. Wow, is that hard to do?\n\nThe elevators do have a keypad system that tells you which elevator to use. The longest wait we had was about 15 seconds....and there was a convention going on next door at the convention center. And no, we did not \"forget\" which elevator to get on. Maybe the reviewer should be a bit less self absorbed, get his head away from his phone and pay attention to what's going on around him. Not that difficult folks.\n\nNow that I debunked those two non issues from a previous reviewer, I can tell you we enjoy the amenities the Westin has to offer.

I'd heard they were reputed to have the best fish sandwich in the city, so that's what I was looking for. \n\n(By the way, as a side-note to the people, on Yelp and elsewhere, who whine about how a restaurant with the word \"Oyster\" in its name should focus on gourmet oysters and not fish sandwiches: Jesus, grow up. I don't go to Red Robin because I'm in the mood for some robin carpaccio, and I don't go to the Silk Elephant because I'm in the mood for some broiled pachyderms. A name is just a name. This is a very old establishment, and if you didn't do your homework going in to know what's good to order nowadays, then the fault is wholly yours, and I have zero sympathy. To quote a wise Russian: CRY SOME MORE.)\n\nAnyway, back to the sandwich:\n\nI got a platter with fries, slaw, and the sandwich. Sounds very pedestrian, sure, but it was far from ordinary. The slaw was very substantial and was dressed well without being overwhelming. The fries were extremely fresh, had a lot of substance to them, and were satisfyingly crispy. The fish sandwich itself- heck, I can hardly write about it, because I couldn't help but to inhale it. It was the best fish sandwich I can recall ever having eaten, and I could hardly stop myself from wolfing it down, bite after intoxicating bite. It's something you really just need to experience for yourself.\n\nI ate at the bar, and your usual condiments (ketchup, tartar sauce, salt, pepper, etc) were easily at hand. I used a moderate dollop of tartar sauce on my sandwich, which was great, but I'm sure the sandwich would have stood up fine without it, too. A lot of places' fish sandwiches are extremely bland and dry, making the tartar sauce necessary just to swallow it down, but the OOH's sandwich needs no such crutch. The tartar sauce is able to do what it's really meant to do: complement an already-excellent fish dish\n\nSo, what else can I say? I feel like my life as a Pittsburgher is enriched just knowing that this place exists, and I can't believe I've been missing out as long as I have been. I'm a graduate student at Pitt, and I can guarantee that whenever I have a solid hour free for lunch, I'll hop a bus downtown to get another fish sandwich platter.

One thing I am starting to notice about this area, it seems acceptable to have curt or even rude service. I suppose I was jaded before.\n\nOk, the food itself. The side of coleslaw was rather good. It tasted fresh and creamy! The crabcake...(can I call it that?) was more like a clump of Stove Top Stuffing and a tiny bit of crab meat. The two jumbo fried shrimp were ok.

Honestly, I was a bit underwhelmed.  As you walk in, it comes across as a bit of a small, a little bit dingy, diner.  I have no problem with that, I happen to love diners, but it's not what I would expect from a place I am hoping to get good seafood.  The selection for beer with dinner was rather limited (but let's face it we weren't going there for beer, it's just something I noticed)  The service was seriously lacking.  When asking for our order, the waitress was literally on her cell phone.  I could never tell if she was paying attention to us or not.   \n\nI also found the set-up of the restaurant to be rather lacking.  It feels very claustrophobic, and while we were sitting up at the counter, a number of people bumped into me due to the fact that there is very little room to walk around.  \n\nNow, as far as the food goes, nothing was BAD, but it wasn't stellar.  Nothing on the menu seemed to be \"Great\" to me.  I ordered clam strips, and there was absolutely nothing special about them whatsoever.  They are the same clam strips I could get anywhere else I were to ever go.  There was no extra flavoring, no pizazz, nothing.  Just some strips of clam fried up.  Same goes for the french fries.  Now, the green beans I got were of note, because they were really gross.  There was no flavoring added to them whatsoever, they were just plain, boring, soggy green beans.  I was very much let down.\n\nSo all in all, if you are looking for something quick and find yourself downtown, the Original Oyster House is perfectly acceptable.  If you are looking for some place that makes very unique, delicious seafood meals, find something else.", "type": "review", "business_id": "-KQ283hJkBO12u8XOrlCcQ"}

It turns out very few people in Pittsburgh or at least in our office actually knew this restaurant. It's an old, tiny restaurant located in the beautiful Market Square. It's so old school they only take cash! The place is called  \"Original Oyster House\" but ironically they don't serve raw oysters, let alone decent oysters! They only have these mediocre breaded oysters that you can have in your sandwich or by themselves. Everything else is average. There is nothing special about this place except for the fact that it was the \"first restaurant\" in Da Burgh as supported by the front door sign \"historical landmark.\" If you're looking for good oysters, raw or not, or simply a good restaurant for lunch or dinner, this is definitely NOT the place.", "type": "review", "business_id": "-KQ283hJkBO12u8XOrlCcQ"}

We were prepared for foam plates and cash only, which works for a nice lunch outside. Sadly we were disappointed with our meal. Our group of 3 tried the breaded oysters, famous fried fish, beer-battered fish nuggets, and crab cakes with fries and onion rings. Although the portions were generous for being fried, much of the food was soggy due to the excess of grease. We were in an area with a server, but the service was terrible. Our server continually ignored us and frequently forgot items she was supposed to bring to the point that we went inside to get the items ourselves. The food is a good deal if you are willing to overlook the service and like really greasy fried seafood.", "type": "review", "business_id": "-KQ283hJkBO12u8XOrlCcQ"}

This place has been around for years and you can tell it, from the black-and-white pictures hung on the mirrored wall behind the bar to the fading tiles on the floor.\n\nI had a crab cake sandwich and it was perfection.  Large chunks of crab on a potato bun with a swish of mayo, lettuce, and tomato slice.  The house-made chips are great, though I didn't get a whole lot of them with my sandwich - probably less than a serving, though I'm okay because the sandwich was so good, you just needed a little crunch to go with it.\n\nMy boyfriend got the jumbo fish sandwich (not to be confused with the massive fish sandwich) and it was indeed jumbo.  Huge piece of fresh cod on a kaisesr roll.  It was the kind where the ends are hanging off the bun.  I can only imagine the size of the massive sandwich!  The fish inside was tender and the batter was perfectly crunchy and golden.\n\nFresh, delicious fish cooked perfectly.  Our server was super nice and took great care of us.  Definitely put it on your list!", "type": "review", "business_id": "-KQ283hJkBO12u8XOrlCcQ"}

We were downtown early for a dance lesson and were looking to kill some time eating dinner.  After entering Market Square we looked at our choices and chose the Oyster House after noting its shaded outdoor seating.  With our decision made, we walked into the Oyster House to get some menus.  The inside of the place consists of a large bar on one side and a line of tables on the other side.  Each table already has on it some hot sauce as well as some vinegar with hot peppers soaking in it.  Soon after we entered we asked the bartender if we could sit outside.  She said yes while giving us some menus and letting us know that the closer we sat to the door, the better service we would have.  With that we headed out the door and sat down in the only shady spot further away from the door.  I did notice that there were two different servers waiting on people outside and figure that was what the bartender was referring to.\n\nAfter a little bit longer of a wait than I would have liked (and wishing we were sitting closer to the door), we were waited on and I ended up ordering the titanic platter while my fiance went with the crab cakes.  My titanic platter consisted of the monster fish sandwich and 2 sides for which I chose the Pittsburgh cut ribbon taters and then I upgraded my second one to the New England clam chowder.  After only a short time both of the clam chowders came out of the kitchen.  It ended up being surprisingly good with a nice creaminess to it and what I think was fish in addition to the clams.  My fish sandwich was also pretty good as the two filets had a nicely cooked thin coating that was crunchy.  The Pittsburgh cut ribbon taters were also a slight disappointment as they were merely potato chips.  I guess I probably should have asked about them instead of just ordering them.  Finally I was also able to taste my fiances Maryland style crab cakes which I did not  think were good at all.  There was not a hint of old bay in them and it had a distinct mayonnaise taste to it.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I might be back here in the future.  It's never going to be my fish pick of a restaurant in Market Square but I did really enjoy the fried fish and see myself eating here from time to time.", "type": "review", "business_id": "-KQ283hJkBO12u8XOrlCcQ"}

I ordered the chicken tender platter with a side of fries and we had some calamari. With regards to food,it's so so,I've been with few different places in Pittsburgh that really serves good enough calamari. I've from the Philippines so i know what is good and what's great in terms of calamari. Our server was ok,she checked on us maybe twice,the only thing I can say is that she didn't tell us they only take cash and they don't take cards. I've never seen it somewhere stating they only take cash. I'm a card person. I probably have a buck or two in my wallet coz I use my cards for everything. I have ten credit cards and 2 debit cards in my wallet,good thing I remember my debit card pin,made a withdrawal,paid the atm fee and gave them cash. Imagine a place that's been around since forever and they don't take cards. Are u kidding me? Even mom and pop store accept cards.goodness. I am disappointed. We own a business so I can understand the merchant fees for card transactions but hey,it's part of operating a business.
