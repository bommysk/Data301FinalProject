And after reading all the high reviews from fellow yelpers. \n\n  This bar is less than 5 minutes from where I live.  I stopped in on a Saturday night and was pleased with the music that was playing and also the fact that the bar was not overcrowded. The bar tender barely acknowledged me the whole night.  \n\nThere wasn't any free peanuts or popcorn when I visited. Nor did they have the beer that I like on tap.  I did get a very tasty double chocolate stout, which I found to be delicious in every way.  The owner of the place even gave me an annoyed look.\n\nSaturday night is usually a crappy night to try out any new place.  The service was slow but I got the feeling that the bartender couldn't be bothered to wait on me.  \n\nI haven't completely written this place off.  I'll just try again during the week.","Damn good ice cream.  \n\nI love a great generational dining experience, my grandma took me here when I was a little girl and this past weekend I got to share the experience with my boyfriend his mom and nephews.\n\nI ordered a traditional banana split, but really I wanted to have one of everything on the menu. \n\nThe strawberries are real strawberries!!! That alone sets Page Dairy Mart a part from the rest.","I am taking away a star because they don't deliver. If China Taste delivered I could easily see myself eating from here weekly.  This is a hole in the wall in a seedy neighborhood but I just can't get enough.\n\nThe Chinese food is some of the best I've had.  Typically get the Hunan Shrimp or Schezwan shrimp with a side of pork fried rice. The shrimp are big and taste fresh not frozen . large and cooked perfectly and the veggies are always crisp and not soggy and over done. Also we've had the sweet and sour chicken and General Tso's chicken.  \nAlthough the restaurant is tiny and a little run down the food is very good.\nAll the entrees I've ever had were served pipping hot. \n\nThe restaurant is really nothing pretty and there are a total of 3 tables. The restaurant is tiny.  If you're passing through the Northside check this place out.","The owners are great and have been serving me hot dogs since I was in middle school.  They do hot dogs right. At Steve's New York Hotdog what you ask for is what you get. \n\nI would be devastated if they ever closed down shop, but from the looks of Steve's is doing just fine.\n\nDuring the lunch rush the line could easily stretch out the door.\n\nRegularly I get the double dog platter. Which is two hotdogs an order of fries and a drink.  Any topping you want is already included in the price of the hot dogs.  They have onions, chili. cheese, pickles and the list continues.  \nThe hamburgers here are thin and of the frozen variety and lack any seasoning on the meat. The fries are always fried to order.  \n\nSteve's also serves breakfast. \n\nI think I'll go have lunch there today.\nThe location of this hotdog ship is situated on an area of Federal that is a tad questionable. But new developments on the street are making the area more inhabitable.  The interior of the restaurant is shappy and dated but there are stools where you can eat at the counter, but less than 15, so if you eat here it's more of a to go place.","A trip to the Omnimax Theater is always a good time and I have never left disappointed.  The theater is massive the screen is something like 5 times that of a regular movie screen it's way bigger then the IMAX. \n\nDid you know that ever Christmas season the Omnimax screens Polar Express! I mean guys you really feel like you're riding on the train!  Seeing the Polar Express annually has become something of a family tradition for me and the little ones. \n\nAnd how cool was it that Batman the Dark Knight Raises was also screened here? The massive screen  added a layer of epic to the film viewing experience that in no way could be matched by any other theater around town. \n\nTickets for movies at the Omnimax can be purchased separately from the general admission pass to the museum.  I recall ticket prices for shows being any where for $9-$12.00. \n\nBonus it's all set up like a movie theater and is accompanied by a concession stand that serves ICEEs.  I would not suggest it for very little kids under 5 , the sound is very loud and can prove to be frightening and over whelming. I learned this the hard way.","Oh hell yeah, for a restaurant on East Ohio street I think it's pretty damn good.  \n\nThe fried chicken wings are delicious seasoned good and taste just like mama makes.  On my last visit we got fried chicken for take out.  The order was fairly big too.  I come from a family of six , we must have had 40 wings.  Lillen's handled the order well. I'm all smiles.\n\nDon't be deterred the inside is little run down. Lillen's could use a face life, but hell the fryers still work and that's all that I'm concerned about.","Everything about this place seems very antiquated.  I wasn't impressed with my clam chowder.  There was some kind of bread component inside the clam chowder that may have been an attempt at dumplings but just tasted like soggy bread.  \n\nI'm not a fan","The only good thing this restaurant has going for it, is their bar! \n\nThey have 22oz glasses!!!  and is very close to my job, which is great for an after work drink \n\nThe food is terrible I mean the worse of the worse, I am not a big fan of Italian food and it's because of restaurants like this!! \n\nOn one occasion I made the mistake of ordering food from this restaurant I had tortellini  in a tomato sauce,  I've had better Italian food from a can.\n\nMore is not always better the serving size could easily have fed six grown adults."],"type":["High Rating","High Rating","High Rating","High Rating","High Rating","High

I have eaten here once or twice and gotten takeout from here once. It's tasty, and the beer selection is impressive, but the experience hadn't quite knocked my socks off until last night. \n\nMy husband ordered some to-go food to eat while we were at the nearby The Loft bar. He ordered the Mac'N Cheese hot dog with Fries. The hot dog was incredible! The mac and cheese was so delicious that I asked one of The Loft's bartenders for a fork to finish off the 1/2 cup of mac and cheese that had fallen off the bun and was laying sadly in the styrofoam box. I wasn't wasting a bite of that deliciousness. The fries were really tasty, too -- super crispy and perfectly seasoned.\n\nBased on my overall experience at D's, I still rate this place 3 stars. However, if I have a few more of the Mac'N Cheese hot dog and Fries combinations, I may be quickly updating my review!","After hearing Hofbrauhaus-haters say that Max's Allegheny Tavern is the only place to go in Pittsburgh for German food, my husband and I decided to finally try the restaurant this afternoon.\n\nWe were seated in little booths right next to the bar. They were cozy, but the seats reminded me of old fashioned church pews. Our waitress soon brought us a little basket of four rolls with butter, sauerkraut relish, and apple butter. Though I liked the different varieties of bread, it was nothing special. The relish and apple butter were a nice touch though.\n\nOur waitress was busy with both waiting tables and tending the bar, but she managed to check on us pretty frequently. Our food also came out relatively promptly. I order the Wiener Schnitzel with Potato Pancakes and Spatzle on the side. The Wiener Schnitzel was amazing -- by far the best I've ever had! The veal was tender and the fried surface was perfectly crispy. However, the sides sadly did not match this main dish. The Potato Pancakes were oddly bitter, and I did not enjoy them with either the sour cream or applesauce. I only ate two or three bites and completely stopped eating them. (I must add that Hofbrauhaus's potato pancakes are delicious and something that I order every time that I go there.) I also did not enjoy the Spatzle, but I am accustomed to eating cheese Spatzle.... So I may be reviewing this harshly since I'm just not used to plain Spatzle, but in my opinion, it was terribly bland and watery.\n\nOverall, Max's Allegheny Tavern served one incredible item (Wiener Schnitzel), but everything else was merely mediocre. Because of this, I really don't plan on returning to the restaurant again any time soon. I'll be sticking with the fun environment and overall good food at Hofbrauhaus, actually.","I brought my little kitty Molly here about a year ago and was so impressed with the Cat Clinic! I feel that most vets know a lot about dogs and just a little about cats, but needless to say, the Cat Clinic is very different. We were having trouble with Molly and our other cat getting along, and the doctor gave very helpful advice.I would definitely come back here again.","Thanks as always to Rachel and the Pittsburgh Yelp team for securing tickets for us to The Nutcracker! The hubby and I planned a fun evening around the event, starting the evening with appetizers and drinks at Sonoma and ending with dinner and dessert at Butcher and the Rye.\n\nI have only been to The Nutcracker a couple other times during my life (once as a little girl and another time in college) and was really looking forward to attending for the third time. I wish that I could say the show lived up to my expectations, but to be perfectly honest, it did not. For me, the bright spots of the performance were the Snow King and Snow Queen, the Arabian dancers, and the fun Pittsburgh references, such as the large clock and the party guests. I struggled with the pace of the show as it began to feel long to me, especially in Act I, and also with the very softly projected pre-recorded music. Maybe the music was louder closer to the stage, but from row R on the main floor, I could more easily hear a number of whispered conversations and show commentary occurring around me than I could hear the actual music.\n\nI love attending plays and musicals but must admit that I would have been disappointed to have paid $50/seat to attend this show. I have really enjoyed attending both A Musical Christmas Carol and the Holiday Pops in the past and would prefer to return to them - at a lower cost - in the future versus coming back to The Nutcracker.","Over the past five years, I've been to this convention center four times and have enjoyed each time here. It's an impressive and well maintained building that provides both locals and out-of-towners with a good impression of the city. \n\nThe first time at the center, I lived in NC and was attending a big work event here. I was very impressed by the architecture of the center but sadly wasn't in an area where I could see beautiful views of the city. \n\nAfter moving to Pittsburgh, I came for the annual home show and auto show. Though I liked both shows, the auto show was a bit more impressive. I hear that the home and garden show is a must-attend! \n\nFinally, I came here for the Boden liquidation sale yesterday. The views from the line to enter (where I sat for a looong time) were absolutely stunning! The section of the center overlooked the river and the North Shore with a bridge flanking both sides of the view. I didn't mind the wait just because I could admire the view. I look forward to coming back for the home and garden and auto shows in 2014!"],"type":["High Rating","High Rating","High Rating","High Rating","Medium

Un-fresh and damn near flavorless all but for some powdery heat. Please invest in fresh chillies; they keep well and will make that \"8\" really pop with flavor.","I have been to this place this weekend with my fried family. We expected some authentic Indian style food. We ordered chicken biriyani, lamb biriyani, peas pulav and Chicken Pakora, Gulab jam. Biriyani was awful it's taste less. Full of racines. This restaurants is definitely not for South Indians. Maintainance and service was good but food is completely tasteless. Chicken pakora is at best. Papad is awesome. On Biriyani and pees pulav we Wasted money.","This place is terrible. Pittsburgh does not know how to make any food correct, let alone the complexity of Indian cuisine.  This city is the dumpster of the eastern U.S.  Do not go here, do not ever go to Pittsburgh.","I had high hopes for Taste of India, after reading the reviews, but I was not impressed. The food did not taste fresh (I had pakoras and an eggplant dish) and the rice was definitely old and crisp from sitting in the bottom of the cooker. I asked for spicy and my dish was quite mild. We were there toward the end of the night and the staff seemed resentful of our presence. As much as I love Indian food, I'll probably give Taste of India one more chance sometime, earlier in the evening. I hope to report back with at least one additional star.","The problem is inconsistency.  Sometimes a dish is very good, other times not so good.  Dal Makhni last night was like soup--all liquid, little dal. Lamb Curry lacked flavor when in the past it has been wonderful.  It appears that there are different cooks whose approach to dishes can be radically different.  I'd like to be able to count on a consistent product.","If you really know and like Indian cuisine then food here gonna be flavorless and bland for you. Tandoori chicken doesn't taste like one etc. Decor is tasteless and old. Carpet looks really dirty. I'm definitely not coming back.","Good, solid, and strangely inexpensive. \n\nWhile I didn't find Taste of India to be amazingly awesome, its currently in the running for my favorite Indian option in Pittsburgh. Service was fairly attentive, the naan was hot & crispy, and the chicken tikka was really tasty. \nA surprise: the veggie samosas have just a bit of spice-- unexpected and fun! Parking can be a challenge due to the location (directly across the street from Children's Hospital), but there are lots of meters around (and parking is free after 6pm).","Cozy and dim lighting. Food is okay - large quantities for take-out, watch out!","Friendly, kind staff and good service.  I'll go here again and again, for eat-in or take-out.  I don't really have any favorites here...everything is tasty!","Had a great experience here.  Service was super friendly and prompt.  The chicken tikka masala is excellent as well as the paneer naan.  I also tried the chicken curry, which used dark meat.  I thought it was just OK because of the poor quality of the chicken.  However, the curry was excellent.  I can't wait to go back!","The food is good, and excellently spiced.  Though others on this site have reported not being able to get dishes spicy enough, I've never had that problem (when I've ordered 10 out of 10, I got 10).  In fact, that's one of my favorite things about this restaurant: they cook the food exactly the way I want it, pretty consistently.  Sauces are creamy; meat is tender; and prices are reasonable.  I'd say this is easily one of the better Indian restaurants in the city, which is saying something given the plethora of good options.","I got with the tandoori dinner. 18$ for a full meal from appetizer to a nice small desert. Level 7 of spice, it was spicy but if you enjoy extra spicy kick it to a 10. The tandoori dinner was perfect size including the lamb saag I got as my 2nd meat pick. I also got king fisher Indian beer. A Good lager. It was a cold Monday night so I ended up eating my meal and chatting with the guy working the front of the house. It was rather nice since I went alone.\n\nIn the end good service and a relaxing meal with a nice hot cup of tea at the end.\n\nIt was all very good but I have had better lamb saag in the past.","I've drive by, seen the neon sign and the dark windows and have been very skeptical. But I finally went inside and it was delicious! Clean, yummy, and the BYOB!","I love this place! Its the best Indian food I've had in Pittsburgh! I absolutely love the chicken tikka masala, it is sooo good!! My boyfriend and I ordered take out once and I like spicy rating of 1 and he likes a 7 and when we got home and tried it they were both sevens. So if you're really sensitive like me, make sure to double check your order. I would definitely recommend Taste of India! I also really like all the vegetarian options!","Tried the vegetarian thali ($12ish) and was really impressed by the quality, variety, and spiciness to order.  Will head back here with a smile.","I have been really struggling to find a good indian place in Pittsburgh, since I moved back into town.  I ordered takeout from Taste of India, and it was ready very quickly (~15 minutes).  I ordered the Saag paneer, chicken tikka masala and an order of plain and garlic naan.  The naan was amazing!  My girlfriend who doesn't even really like Indian food loved the Chicken tikka masala, which was also really good.  The chicken was of really good quality and the sauce was delicious.  I also enjoyed the saag paneer, but probably not the best i've ever had.  Either way, the food was delicious and I will definitely go back!","Just moved from Pittsburgh and I miss Taste of India - this place is great.","Let me explain to you something. I didn't know, until I moved 12 hours away from here, what a magical place Taste of India really is. I also didn't know, that when I fly into Pittsburgh, I would directly be driving from the airport to pick up take out before seeing my family. Helllooo! Here is your daughter you haven't seen in over a year, she comes reeking of curries and spices every-single-time! \n\nCan we start with the fact that the service here is spectacular?! My friends and I have been coming here for years. The owners are cute and funny and we are terrors when we are there because we bring large parties and we are so excited to order an entire table of plates.\n\nWhat fills our table? \n\nBooze, yes, they have beer.\n\nBread: Chapatti (Yummy Whole Wheat Goodness!)\n\nVeggie Options:\nPaneer Jalferji (Cheese and Veg)\nDal Sag (Lentils)\nPaneer Makhni (Cheese and Peas)\nChana Masala (Duh)\n*Personal Fav: Malia Kofta (These little fried vegetable balls with creamy tomato sauce and almonds!) --Haven't found this one anywhere else as good as theirs! Ah! I am drooling thinking of it. \n\nWhat do they do to this freaking food? I just don't know. Go soon! Ask for spice level of 7-8 if you want to tantalize your taste-buds with some fiery food and if you would like to ship me a container of the Malia Kofta I will be more than happy to message you my address.....\n\n\nOh, and my favorite date in Pittsburgh? Taste of India and dancing at Brillo Box. So iconic. So Pittsburgh.","I have been to Taste of India several times, and every time they have never disappointed me. The service is great and the food is amazing. We were seated promptly, orders were taken, water replenished as soon as I was close to being empty and food came out right away. The food are delicious, proportioned and well priced. I always have the chicken tikka masala and butter chicken. I also had their garlic naan, beef and lamb curry. So if you're in the mood for some good Indian cuisine, Taste of India is a great choice.","There are two Indian restaurants pretty close to each other: Taste of India and People's. People's has better appetizers, and of course they have 1/2 off during certain hours, but Taste of India is better by far at entrees, and their masala tea is delicious. The nan is always hot, like hot hot, steaming hot, burn your hands hot, and perfectly done. \n\nChicken Tikka Masala leftovers are sitting in the fridge right now, calling my name. Everything is good and the portions are beyond generous. What is particularly striking is the pricing. Indian food in Orlando and DC tends to be expensive, and those are my frames of reference, but Taste of India is completely reasonable. Even bizarrely inexpensive considering the quality of the food you get.\n\nThe store front is odd, and the place never looks open, but don't be discouraged from going. Once you walk in you'll be seated quickly and served an onion and a mint chutney. Generally there is a young kid in the far back table playing on a computer or GameBoy.\n\nAt the end of the meal, your tip tray comes covered in an anise and sugar mixture with little pink, yellow, and white pellet things. I'm an addict, but always end up eating one pinch more than I ought, where the flavor becomes unappealing. And as much as I know this, I cannot help myself.","I asked the waitress what she recommended. She said they were all good and it's hard to make a decision. I was going to be the judge of that, and she was indeed telling the truth. So good!","Jordan & I have been eating Taste of India at CMU for a while, without knowing it was Taste of India.  At CMU they offer super inexpensive lunches that are more filling than anywhere else to eat at lunch. During this winter break, we have been going through some serious withdraw while the cafe is closed.\n\nThank you YELPERS once again, in our search to satiate our curry addiction, we have found our distributor!  We were excited to read that this restaurant supplied our weekly lunches and we ordered!!\n\nI ordered the Alu Matar Mushroom at a spicy rating of 3 (yes, I'm a sissy), but it was EXACTLY what I wanted!!  Jordan ordered Alu Gobhi which was cauliflower & potato at a spicy rating of 5.  We truly weren't sure how to scale our tolerance; but we decided that next time we could both go hotter.\n\nWe also can't wait to try the Lunch Buffet! We really wish we would have known that this existed during the week in between Christmas & New Years when we were fiending for Indian food.  Now that we know, I have no doubt we will soon become regulars.\n\nWe have also tried Tamarind in Oakland, but that place just made my mouth go numb after it was all said and done (and left me with an unpleasant digestion experience).  All of the bad cliche things you hear about Indian food, is nothing like Taste of India.  You can taste the love cooked in.","Buffet, while small is totally worth it. Has all the essentials!","Darren brought me here, and as a Indian food n00b, I was impressed with everything included in the economical Dinner for Two which gets a diner nan, a meat dish, a veggie dish, dal, a dessert, and tea. The tea and kheer was a nice way to cap off the meal. The mango beef and alu palak were superb. I could live on the bread alone. They look to have renovated the place, and Darren said the bathrooms were much nicer this time around.","Delicious food! The decor is a little lacking, but the food was so outstanding that I have to give it 5 stars. We had 3 types of bread, along with goat mango curry, chana masala, and chicken tikka masala. All of these were excellent, with fresh flavor and nuanced taste. We asked for a spice level of 8, and the spice was spot on.  Flavors were so without being muddled. \n\nI would definitely, definitely return next time I come to Pittsburgh.","This place knocked me out.\n\nI had garlic naan and the lamb Shahajahani.  The sauce was so good, I used all the naan to sop it up.  (The waiter told me it was OK to do that.  Not sure if it really was, but I don't care.  I wasn't gonna leave any.)\n\nI travel a lot, and enjoy finding little places like this that are inconspicuous, where you can get great food, great service at a really decent price.  I had what I described above, plus a half-carafe of their house wine (not spectacular, but who cares) for $29, tip included.  And it was a good tip.\n\nThe server was very friendly and helpful and took time to help select the best choice for what I was in the mood for. And, he thanked me about six times for coming in, which was really refreshing.\n\nThis beats Indian I've had in Boston, New York and Berlin.  Will definitely be back on next trip to Pittsburgh.","That woman that you see in the corner, a table full of food? Yeah - that's me. Don't judge....  I lose all ability to think rationally when I cross through the door. 4 entrees, biryani and a samosa? Yes. Why not? How can I possibly be expected to choose between such flavorful and reasonably priced food? It's the culinary equivalent of Sophie's Choice.\n\nThe staff is wonderful, the food is terrific - get the Samosas, saag paneer and dal makhni. Oh, and the tikka masala. And the muglai korma.\nOr you could do the lunch buffet and save your dignity. But then you wouldn't have leftovers for lunch. And - trust me - you'll want leftovers for lunch."],"type":["Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Medium Rating","Medium Rating","High Rating","High

Burlington Coat Factory.  Yeah there's a lot of crap.  Yeah, there's a lot of stuff that has been picked over.  But every so often, I find that one item I've been looking for.  I recently bought a nice Polo knit shirt for my husband and no one can tell that I didn't buy it at Macy's.\n\nI like this location because it's Downtown and I can shop on my lunch hour.","We ordered from Villa Reale after a long supervisor's meeting this morning.  Villa Reale is primarily a pizza joint, but we ordered sandwiches figuring to each his own.\n\nI'd read very mixed reviews of Villa Reale so I was a little hesitant about ordering from here.  But my 6\" Italian hoagie was as good as any I've had from any other Downtown place like Monte Cello's.","Whenever I'm in Bloomfield, I've gotta stop in at Donatelli's.  Okay, Donatelli's was my primary reason for going to Bloomfield the other day.  I had to pick up a few of the usual staples.  Our fridge was getting mighty low on mozzarella, provolone, and Italian lunch meats (the salami was on special, BTW!).  Ditto for our pantry--It was getting a little shy on the fine imported pastas, biscottis, etc.  Gotta restock!","Donatelli's is absolutely terrific--one of those local gems that make the Bloomfield neighborhood so wonderful.  Whenever I'm in the area, I make it a point to stop here.  Being that I'm half Italian, I love coming here.  The help here is really friendly,\n\nAlyson is right, try the biscotti!  As for me, I love the things that you can't really get at Giant Eagle.  They have terrific imported pastas and Italian condiments.  Their deli counter is unbeatable--certainly better than the aforementioned Giant Eagle.  I particularly recommend trying their cheeses!","Yet another review for Donatelli's?  \n\nWell let's take a look at the January specials.  Imported Polish ham for $3.99 lb.  Polish ham at an Italian store?  Okay!  Fresh homemade pasta for $2.49 lb!  Gonna be having some veal tortellini with spicy Italian sausage and my homemade marinara sauce for dinner tonight.  Nicholas coffee for $6.99 lib.  We all know that Susan doesn't resume the form of a human female until she's had that 2nd cup.","Dunning's Grill is another one of those solid neighborhood joints.  Nothing on the menu here'll surprise you, but you'll get good chow for your buck here.  We're taling standard bar fare here--burgers, wraps, fish sandwiches, and variations of fried and grilled chicken.  \n\nIt's a good place to meet up with your friends before or after a movie at the nearby Regent's Square as I did.  I had the BLT which was as good as any other BLT I've had at least a dozen other places.  They have vegetarian options here but if you're a true vegetarian or vegan be forewarned!  They're really meatless variations of their regular menu items."],"type":["Medium Rating","Medium Rating","Medium Rating","Medium Rating","Medium Rating","Medium

Goulash in the Contrucci household was made of elbow noodles, beef and spaghetti sauce.  I guess you can't believe everything your parents tell you right?  \n\nSo going in here, I was thinking, great...mom's goulash!  What was set in front me looked NOTHING like what I was used to.  It was a mish mosh of veggies,noodles, gravy and some random unidentifiable food items.  I usually eat whatever is put in front of me, so I wasn't scared to dive it.  Sadly, I just didn't like it.  I thought it was actually not very appetizing at all.  I know, I know, this is like \"world famous\" goulash, but I was NOT into it!  \n\nWhat I was into was the German Potato Salad.  I love it, and honestly, I feel like I never get the same version of it anywhere in the Burgh.  This was a no frills version, with scallop sliced potatoes and a thick vinegar sauce.  Maybe a bit too much, but not enough for me to eat it all!  \n\nWould I go back? If someone else really wanted to go there, but I wouldn't suggest it nor would I go on my own.  Oh well, on to the next one right?","This used to be the best German food in town. I have seen a gradual decline in the food over the past several years. The gravies have changed and the Max's Goulash (one of my favorite dishes) has a different sauce (strangely dessert sweet) and change in the protein. The sides are still great, but the food used to be so much better.","The goulash was (sickeningly) sweet and the bread pudding wasn't sweet at all.  But the atmosphere is kind of cool.  And the prices are downright cheap.","After hearing Hofbrauhaus-haters say that Max's Allegheny Tavern is the only place to go in Pittsburgh for German food, my husband and I decided to finally try the restaurant this afternoon.\n\nWe were seated in little booths right next to the bar. They were cozy, but the seats reminded me of old fashioned church pews. Our waitress soon brought us a little basket of four rolls with butter, sauerkraut relish, and apple butter. Though I liked the different varieties of bread, it was nothing special. The relish and apple butter were a nice touch though.\n\nOur waitress was busy with both waiting tables and tending the bar, but she managed to check on us pretty frequently. Our food also came out relatively promptly. I order the Wiener Schnitzel with Potato Pancakes and Spatzle on the side. The Wiener Schnitzel was amazing -- by far the best I've ever had! The veal was tender and the fried surface was perfectly crispy. However, the sides sadly did not match this main dish. The Potato Pancakes were oddly bitter, and I did not enjoy them with either the sour cream or applesauce. I only ate two or three bites and completely stopped eating them. (I must add that Hofbrauhaus's potato pancakes are delicious and something that I order every time that I go there.) I also did not enjoy the Spatzle, but I am accustomed to eating cheese Spatzle.... So I may be reviewing this harshly since I'm just not used to plain Spatzle, but in my opinion, it was terribly bland and watery.\n\nOverall, Max's Allegheny Tavern served one incredible item (Wiener Schnitzel), but everything else was merely mediocre. Because of this, I really don't plan on returning to the restaurant again any time soon. I'll be sticking with the fun environment and overall good food at Hofbrauhaus, actually.","I really thought I'd never be back.  The goulash I had was so so gross.  But then,  was roped in by some friends who were doing a Sunday brunch book club.  Of course I couldn't miss out on tantalizing conversation... so I obliged.  \n\nI really had no clue what they offered for brunch options, but quickly learned they have a a pretty decent size brunch buffet.  I'm not below buffets at all, it's the fat kid in me!  Most things still looked a little questionable to me, but I went for the big ticket items.  Make your own omelets, potato pancakes and dessert.  I'd hit up the buffet again, but still be hasty to check out the regular menu again.  \n\nThe omelet was made right in front of you, so I added cheese, mushrooms, peppers, tomatoes and onions.  I was super excited about it because it was the size of a football.  Sadly, it was pretty tasteless.  I don't think they added any salt or pepper to the egg mix, so it came out really bland, despite loading up on ingredients.  \n\nBut the potato pancakes... I could survive on them forever.  They were amazeballs!  Add some sour cream and I was in potato patch heaven!  I had to keep myself from getting more because of the other thing I loaded up on... dessert.  \n\nThe desserts looked unassuming, but they were also awesome.  I had a smattering of delectable bites.  The scones were so moist and tasty.  I had to stop myself from taking more than 20.  I also had some carrot cake, brownies, cookies among other things I inhaled and didn't pay attention too.  Should I be embarrassed?  Probably.  But I don't care because it was darn good!","I took my boyfriend, a German-food enthusiast, to Max's Allegheny Tavern last night. We had been looking forward to a night out together for a while. \n\nI think the food was good, but it's hard to say, because all I could focus on was the LOUD -- and I mean LOUD -- woman seated behind my boyfriend and me.\n\nHer profanity-laden discussion with her dining partners was so bad that for the first time in my life, I turned around and asked a fellow restaurant patron to take the volume down a few notches. \n\nThe restaurant was almost empty; I have no idea why the host chose to seat a loud party of five next to a couple having a quiet dinner.","FYI: New happy hour specials are awful. Just awful. Sorry guys, as much as i love you   I've got to put my food down somewhere. Even raising the prices on all of the apps to 3.99 would've been better than taking the pierogie (aka potato pockets) special off all together. \n\nWon't be back.","I've been here once because this was an easy place to meet for dinner with a friend. I enjoyed eating here well enough.\n\nI'm honestly not a die-hard fan of German food, although I guess that wouldn't have mattered: a peak at the menu beforehand revealed that this place's menu is mostly Americanized - proof of this is the fact that my salad was topped with French fries (only in Pittsburgh...). Trust me, even if you don't really like German food, there'll at least be a sandwich you'll like here.\n\nThinking about my usual \"overall\" summary, I have to say this place wasn't bad and served as a reasonable place to meet - the beer menu looked nice from what I saw and the atmosphere was pretty cozy and even nostalgic and homely - but man, the dining options really weren't that extraordinary. I'm still torn as to how to feel about its menu, because on the one hand obviously it being Americanized meant even I could find something to enjoy, but on the other I feel bad for the people who do like German food and may not be getting what they hope for. \n\nIt wasn't bad enough that I'd say don't try it and see - just understand it may not be exactly what you expect.","Authentic German fare. German beer. Best soft pretzels in Pittsburgh. Reasonable prices. Friendly service. Very fair portion sizes. You'll be taking a box home. The basement is nice. But sometimes used for private events. Has a very cozy \"grotto\" feel to it.","Want a taste of the old ethnic communities of Pittsburgh? Go to Max's Allegheny Tavern. German never tasted sooo nice!\n\nMenu Fav: Potato Pancake Reuben. Forget the bread and wrap your lips around sweet potato pancakes and loads of corned beef. Try the hot potato salad too.","This place is great for brunch on Sunday! The service is great and the food is delicious. I always leave stuffed and happy.","I have a friend that loves this place, and I have been told it's the best German food in Pittsburgh so I had to give it a try.\n\nI had the Roasted Loin of Pork Stubenkuchen Style with German Style Potato Salad, and Sauerkraut. Everything was really good. The Pork was delicious and that mushroom gravy that they put on it was nothing short of amazing. I want a whole bucket of the stuff to put on everything. The Sauerkraut was interesting featuring shredded pork mixed in. The german potato salad was good but was pretty much what I expected. \n\nTheir draft  beer Selection left a little bit to be desired but featured 5-8 beers many of them popular german style beers. \n\nI got a good idea what this place is all about and I have to say that I will be back for more.","I ordered the Roast Pork loin with Apple raisin dressing, sauerkraut, and German potatoes. Oh yeah... Right Choice! Took a little longer than usual as there was a Large Party of 16 that ordered Just prior to us. Happy to say the waitress took Great care of us, plenty of rolls, drink refills, etc. as we waited. Apple Strudel for the Final Act. So Good, I forgot to take a picture. lol","Diane is awesome, i used to live in PA and\nmoved to CA and this is a great place for a beer,\ncheap food and good friends.\nI miss this place.\nOne of my favorites places back home in PA!","I've been going to Max's off and on for 31 years (I KNOW!  How could someone as young as I am been going there for THAT long?)    And I am not from nor ever lived in the North Side!\n\nThat said...i have always loved the food and the place.   I was great the first time and was great last night!   Most of the mains can be recommended without reservation....last night I had roasted pork with dressing and gravy.  It was deliscious!    As for sides....I ALWAYS have potato pancakes and sweet and sour cabbage.  (Because of my eastern european background I am partial to both cabbage and potatoes.   Do not be afraid of the cabbage unless you dislike sour! \n\nWe didn't have dessert, but did have beer and drinks.   They have a nice selection.\n\nMy only complaint was that the food was slow to come out.   It was a busy Friday night and I wasn't going anywhere so I had anover beer.   No big problem.\n\nGive Max's a try.....it might make your favorite like it did mine!","I have a confession to make........the thing I like most about Max's is their bread!!! They are free....they are fresh made....hot and soft...different kinds....and so so delicious!\nI'm not a big fan of German food, but it's just my personal taste. The portions are large and atmosphere is very relaxing and casual. I like it.","Our first stop in Pittsburgh, what a great start! Had a couple of yuenglings, a warm, salty yummy soft pretzel and a big ole plate of German goodness in da tummy!\n\nThe Peasant Platter had knock wurst, weisswurst and a pork chop on top of heap of sauerkraut...with potato pancakes, spaetzel and a basket of baked breads!  So.much.food.  And oh soooo good!\n\nThe bar is cool, staff is really nice and I believe they offer their patrons a free ride to and from on game days!","We (my fiance and I) went out for a pseudo-couples' date with our good friends, Sara and Thom, to Max's to introduce them to some of the most authentic German food in da Burgh. Where most people associate Hofbrauhaus with the ultimate German beer-hall experience, I prefer Max's for the quieter, less raucous environs. (At least when it's not Oktoberfest)\n\nWe'd been there once before and immediately fell in love with the place. I (still) keep raving about the Sausage and Cheese platter. They've got some good Gouda. The Potato Pockets (pierogies) were OK -- I'd take some Pierogies Plus or Forgotten Taste over Max's, but that's just me.\n\nThe spaetzel was to die for, however. It's like a German Mac n' Cheese. And boy, do I love me some Mac n' Cheese. It literally melts in your mouth with its' ooey-gooey-ness.\n\nDrink-wise, I tried their German lager and Thom tried the sampler. Thom is a beer enthusiast. For around eight bucks, you get a GOOD amount of beers to try -- they are not some dinky little shot glass samples, either. Thom had some trouble near the end finishing it...it was so much beer. Bob had a Captain and ginger-ale...in a king-size goblet. Goblets are the ONLY way to serve adult bevvies.\n\nFor dinner, I had the pork loin over an apple-raisin gravy/bread concoction. The pork loin was flavorful and tender, and quite delicious. Sara had the sauerbraten and seemed to enjoy it. Bob's burger was ginormous and looked extra tasty.\n\nWe finished it off with the Apple Fritters. Now, these fritters aren't for the faint of heart. And they aren't your average dinky small sized portions, either. You get two huge deep fried apple fritters, covered in vanilla ice cream. One person CANNOT eat the whole serving. You must, I repeat MUST share them. If you attempt to eat the whole plate yourself, you will have flavor explosion, followed by severe heartburn. But damn, are they GOOD.\n\nOur visit ended up totaling 2 hours. One thing, though...please fix your outdoor sign. Usually it shines out like a red and blue beacon in the night for people to find their way there, but on Wednesday, it was out. Driving there, I got confused on where it exactly was (but I had a general idea, as I had been there before.).","Max's is my parents' favorite restaurant when they're in town visiting me. Good, solid food with a great deal of [German] variety. I love the German beer flights (i.e., beer sampler) and the atmosphere is funny - a bit like your grandmother's parlor. The bread that comes with entrees is delicious (pumperknickel + others), and their cherry sauer kraut is delicious as well.\n\nThe food is good, but you must be careful with certain dishes. One of the schnitzels that comes with carrots/peas is clearly bedecked in carrots & peas that were recently frozen. German food isn't exactly known for its vegetables, so I let it slide but I always remember not to order that dish when I'm there.","I have been coming to Max Allegheny Tavern since I was still in my mother's womb.  But seriously.  This place has been an institution for my family, and I really love it here.  I feel like this is some of the only German food in Pittsburgh, and I think it represents fairly well.  My thoughts:\n\nBrunch Buffet- I love the Sunday brunch buffet more than life.  Omelette station, German and American breakfast and lunch foods, and lots and lots of beautiful, delicious, and decadent desserts.  It's heaven on Earth.  There is usually a decent selection of meats, and the potato pancakes are almost always featured.  They've changed it a bit over the years, but I still love this buffet.\n\nAppetizers- My family loves the soft pretzels.  They are so yummy and buttery, but a bit heavy if you are going to eat your entire meal.  So make sure to share.\n\nMeals-  I, personally, have never had a bad meal here.  The sauasages of all varieties have been great.  The weinerschnitzel also great.  Sandwiches all good as well.  I really like the cheesy spaetzle dish that is just like macaroni and cheese but with spaetzle noodles!  I don't get too crazy and order anything complicated, though.\n\nSides-  I love love love their sides.  I could live on the spaetzle and potato pancakes.  Don't pass the sides up!\n\nDessert:  Also love their desserts.  There is a chocolate chocolate cake that they heat up with homemade whipped cream that is TO DIE FOR.  Not so shockingly, the apple strudel is wonderful as well.\n\nBesides the food, the servers are always very friendly and efficient.  There is also ample street parking, which is really nice.  Definitley check this place out if you have not yet.","How can there be no reviews of Max's Allegheny? This north side German food institution in Pittsburgh has been around for years and years and has menus that tell you so. They also tell you the story of the north side of Pittsburgh, which I also found interesting. The place itself has a lot of character and looks like it's seen a lot of years there. It's a little weathered, but definitely homey and sturdy.\n\nRandy S. and I headed there post Tazza D'Oro on a Sunday for brunch. It happened to be the same very Sunday the Pens were playing the Flyers in game 7, so all the waitresses were wearing Pens paraphernalia, which definitely added to the experience. On Sunday morning it has a brunch buffet with all the standards, plus a healthy dose of Germanic add ons like German farmers breakfast (eggs, sausage and gravy-ed potatoes), red cabbage, pork chops, sauerkraut and potato pancakes. \n\nThe brunch buffet is in a room with a giant tapestry of Neuschwanstein behind the guys at the omelet bar. If that's not rad, I don't know what is. We told the waitress we were going in, went and got back and sat down to find our two ice teas on the table in mason jars (always dope). \n\nThe food was just what you would expect in Pittsburgh: gut busting. It wasn't artisinal or fancy, healthy or particularly remarkable, but it was pretty fonking good and to eat that food in that restaurant really made me feel like I was in Pittsburgh. I can imagine all the food there would be of the 'hot and brown' category, in a positive way. And the waitress was probably the nicest on our drive from Dallas to CT. \n\nA really fun place, if showing it's age (though remorselessly).","Real german food (sausage, etc) and decent beer in family friendly atmosphere.\n\nThis is one of the good joints.","Max's is a great place for German food.  I've had several sandwiches, most of the appetizers and even the Sunday brunch (which has a good spread but can be hit or miss) -  though not all in one visit.\n\nI most recently took my Mom out for dinner using a Living Social deal I had.  Somehow, even though we have both been to Max's quite a few times before neither of us had ever seen the sampler platter option on their menu.  For just a bit more than the cost of the regular entrees, you can choose three entrees and two sides.  Obviously the portions of each selection are smaller than the individual meals, but the size is still generous and there were only a couple things not available for the sampler platter.  Between the two of us we selected six different items and four different sides to try and shared everything - and still had enough left for a full meal each the next day.  I can't even decide on my favorite of all the items we tried.  If you aren't sure about some of the entrees, this is a great way to see what you like.  I personally loved everything so much that I think my new go-to menu item from now on will be the sampler platter.  Not being forced to choose just one item is what living in America is all about.\n\nAll together I think our bill was around $35 (no alcoholic beverages consumed).  Some might consider this a tad pricey but the food is so good I usually don't mind the slightly higher cost.  Service has never been a problem for me in fact they've always been helpful when I have questions about the menu.  Full bar with numerous good beers on tap.  If you want German food in Pittsburgh, Max's is definitely the place to start.","Quaint spot on a back street in the North Side.  Very polite service, and delicious food at a great value.  Will definitely go back for authentic German fare.","One of my favorite north side haunts. Great to take visitors who need to understand what it means to be German in Pittsburgh. \n\nGet the soft pretzels. Get anything that comes with a potato pancake. Get the kielbasa. Get it all. You can't go wrong. \n\nOh, and the spaetzle. The spaetzle.......","Max's is one of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh.  It's the Kennywood Thunderbolt of Pittsburgh restaurants.  The Thunderbolt is considered one of the best rollercoasters in the country.  It's not the fastest, it's old, it doesn't have the biggest drops or flip you upside-down.  And yet it's great.  It's classic.  This is Max's Allegheny Tavern.  I'm sure there's better German food with cuter waitresses somewhere out there that doesn't have the decor aesthetics of your grandma's living room.  But who cares.  This place is just right.\n\nFinal note, I can't speak for the brunch buffet.  I went in there for the buffet once and decided that my money would be better spent on the menu.","This is my favorite restaurant on the Northside, possibly favorite restaurant in all of Pittsburgh.  I tell all my friends that this little restaurant is the best kept secret in Pittsburgh.  Max's is a quaint little German place that always has plenty of seating, even on Friday and Saturday nights.  The service is good.  The food is great, I always end up getting the potato pancakes.  If you are looking for a place to check out that isn't going to be as crowded and will be more \"authentic\" German food than other places you should definitely come to Max's!","German food and German beer served in a mason jar. Best in Pittsburgh. The history of the tavern and the friendly makes this wish me that I lived closer to Max's.","Tremendous selection of German dishes.  All the sausages come from a particular manufacturer in Wisconsin that uses 100 year old methods of making them (according to the menu).  I don't know if that's a good thing or not, but they taste terrific.  \n\nThe options for sides are as plentiful as the moan dishes and the hot bacon potato salad was awesome.  \n\nDefinitely recommend giving this a try.","Crap!  I can't believe that I missed a \"First to Review\" by just a matter of weeks.  Max's Allegheny Tavern has been a shining star and a \"must\" for my Pittsburgh rotation of places to visit.  Years ago, when I worked on the Northside for Heinz, I spent many a rowdy Friday night here in the basement with factory workers.  \n\nWhat's there to say?  It's a Northside institution and always has a mixed crowd that is super cool and friendly.  The bartenders are friendly and manage to remember my name and drink choice even though I'm here only a few times a year.  My Friday nights here must have made quite an impression!  I love the decor here, dark wood paneling with lots of stained glass, and the downstairs bar is where the naughty people hang.  Jukebox and room for dancing.  The food is very homey and very reasonably priced.  The German nachos are always worth ordering, and they are smothered with Gouda cheese.  The spatzle is also a creamy indulgent treat.  And for those seeking the real Deutsch culinary experience, they have a large variety of sausages and schnitzels.  So it's a sausage factory in more ways than one.","5 stars because I accept it for what it is.  Really good German comfort  food with killer drafts.  And the fact that the place has been there for forever makes it super cool.  I love the player piano and put a quarter in every time!  PS. the popcorn at the bar is sooooooooo good too.","Been coming to Max's for years. Very consistent. \n\nFood is always excellent, beer is always cold.\n\nPastrami and Swiss was great, but the meal of pork and apple/raisin sauce was out of this world.","Excellent German food.  I went in for an early lunch, the service was great.  Had a whole feast of great dishes.  The best sauerkraut i've ever had -- subtle, with caraway.  Sweet and sour cabbage, potato salad, spaetzle, a great weisswurst, and a great wheat beer on tap.","Best place in town. I love the sampler platter and Sunday brunch is the best deal in town"],"type":["Low Rating","Low Rating","Medium Rating","Medium Rating","Medium Rating","Medium Rating","Medium Rating","Medium

The spring rolls were falling apart and only filled with noodles and a couple of sad looking shrimp, no thai basil or mint leaves or cilantro to speak of. I also got some crispy noodles with seafood which I only ate because I had been sitting on a train for 9 hours and was starving. And the whole thing was seriously overpriced for Pittsburgh, New York prices for extremely subpar vietnamese, meh.","So I am currently sitting here with Pho Minh's Pho tai...and I honestly have to say I am not impressed.  Its a monday and my favorite Pho place (Tram's...in pittsburgh anyway) is closed.\n\nI decided to give this place a go...and take out their pho...\n\nThe broth is actually good, very light yet flavorful.  But the noodles are a disgrace.  They are lumpy, smooshy and not at all chewy...they just kind of dissolve once you put it in your mouth, and they take up none of the broth's flavor.  I also ordered some fresh shrimp spring rolls that were halfway falling apart when I got them, and barely any shrimp.\n\nAll in all, I'll come back if im desperate for Pho on a Monday, but otherwise...nay","Glad to write this review to counter the only other one which is not so enthused... Pho Minh is a small family run place. Family is usually present and it's nice to see the kids hang out and help in the restaurant from time to time.  \n\nMeal starts with free tea served as you are seated. Food is slow to some out but they make it to order and it is a small staff so it's to be expected. It is definitely not a place to go if you need to get in and get out fast. This is a sit down and chat kind of place. \n\nThis is another of my \" I'm sick and need a spicy soup\" strongholds. I suggest the vermicelli soup. I used to stop in here just to buy a few fresh rolls and know I am among several others who do this.\n\nPho Minh won't blow you away it's just a good place to get some Vietnamese food and meet with friends- which is reason enough for me to return.","I was expecting more meat on my pho ut it ends up can't fill me at all.","We traversed the Pittsburgh snowglobe post yoga for Pho. Generally Tram's has been the pho destination. I was curious to try another spot.\n\nRestaurant is cash only. Smaller and less \"warm\" than Trams, but with the same familiar atmosphere. The menu is more extensive than Trams, and seems to have a greater variety of rice and vermicelli dishes. \n\nThe spring rolls were okay - gummy thick wrapper - the tofu was a bit too soft. \n\nGreen papaya salad with shrimp and nuts - refreshing however I personally resent when restaurants use frozen \"supermarket\" grade shrimp and charge premium. With several fish resources in the Strip I really expect better quality shrimp.\n\nPho was much lighter than what I have become accustomed to - and in contrast to another reviewer - I thought it was much less saltier than what I have had at Trams. The beef at Pho Minh was a better quality or cooked longer because I didnt experience the tendony gristle I sometimes find in the pho at the other place, It was soft and well flavored =). \n\nI would come back here for Pho again or to try something else off the menu. I think they can improve on the quality of some of the ingredients, but I appreciate the much less filling, and less bloating Pho..","I go to Pho Minh often, but not for their pho, which is okay but not what I would call good.  I usually get their rice or rice noodle dishes served with grilled pork/chicken/shrimp.  The food, in terms of authenticity and quality is okay, but I have to take into account the fact that we're in Pittsburgh and it's hard to find many quality Vietnamese ingredients here.  However, the food is decent and the service is good.  It's a family business, and the couple that owns the place are very nice and courteous.  When I get too lazy to make some Vietnamese food for myself I go make a quick run to Pho Minh.","This place is totally off the beaten path, but well worth it. Prices are awesome, and the food is tasty. Get the spring rolls. \n\nI ordered the #25 chicken soup with glass noodles and was pleased with it . The service is not great, nor are the restroom facilities, and I had to ask the restaurant constantly for any type of service at our table, but the food was good and done right. The chicken was slightly dry, but I'd definitley give this place another chance. \n\nBYOB!","when tram's is out of the equation, this is my backup. just as good.","I am baffled by some of the low reviews this place got. It looks kind of like a hole in the wall--OK, it is a hole in the wall--but it's got tasty, tasty pho. And, as Al L. mentioned, they give you tea when you come in, a nice touch.\n\nI once ordered some kind of curry. It was not bad, but not spectacular. I'm sticking with pho from now on, as it is really fantastic. \n\nHighly recommended.","This is my favorite type of restaurant, regardless of cuisine; namely, a family run institution with great food, friendly service and an almost complete disinterest in spiffing up the surroundings. Yes, Pho Minh is a bit divey, and I relish this quality. The pho is great, as are all of the dishes I've tried here. I also have a deep appreciation for restaurants that do one cuisine and do it well...none of this Thai/Vietnamese/Japanese combo that only serves to confuse the diner as well as, often, the kitchen. Between this place and Tram's down the street, Pho Minh is my favorite. Pittsburgh has a woeful dearth of good restaurants...I'll try not to go on too much about that in my reviews, as I don't want your eyes to glaze over...so this is a destination restaurant for us. There are very few things more satisfying than a deep bowl of pho on a cold winter day.","This is the best Pittsburgh has to offer in authentic Vietnamese.  I have eaten here several times in the past 7 years or so and have tried several of the items on the menu with success.  I like to order bun with chicken and pork spring rolls.  I also like the Hieu Tu.  Basically chicken pho but with chicken broth instead of beef.  This is typically my go to dish here and it's very good.  It's a small family run place without a lot of slick ambiance.  I wouldn't say you'd be wow'd by the decor but the service is friendly and efficient.  I am always glad I dined here.","Here is another restaurant experience that will make me wanna go there often, for more than just delicious food.. I have stopped by only once and had spicy beef woth lemongrass pho, and boy it was some spicy heaven ! My friends around the table tried different pho as well as some vegetarian tofu stir fry, and I didnt hear a complaint.. \n\nBut the real impressive story about this place is not just food.. a bunch of us went there one afternoon.. we got there a few minutes after 2pm, time they close for lunch.. we saw the timing amd started walking back towards our car and one lady came out and called us back.. they served us with absolutely no rush and an older lady that cooked/prepared our food was genuinely happy to see us walk away happy.. when I eat that kind of food, it not only makes my body happy but mind happier.. people that know that food is not really bound by time but happines to serve.. !","The last review I read said Tram's has better atmosphere. Funny that I ended up at Pho Minh for the second time because Trams had kitchen violations and was shut down. Both times , the food was perfect. We started with the spring rolls, served cold with a nutty fish sauce - deelish. We then ordered the rice pancakes, which were loaded with shrimp and tofu. Lettuce cilantro and basil on the side, all fresh and graciously served. I tried spicy beef over lemongrass. The spice and citrus were a perfect combination. The portions are plentiful and all the entrees were priced under 9$. Highly recommended. One tip-they only take cash. Love this place and hope to add it to the regular rotation of Pgh dining!","I am convinced this place has the best Pho in Pittsburgh the spring rolls are really good too. The space sure isn't fancy but the owners are friendly and attentive. It is the best pittsburgh has to offer for Vietnamese food","Why did I ignore this place for so long?  I keep hearing off comments about this place.  \"It's ok.\"  \"It's decent but other places are better\" \"It's not as good as what you're use to (I'm from California)\" etc etc.  So I was never interested in coming here.\n\nToday, I was working nearby and decided to stop in for the first time.  I have to say I was pleasantly surprised.  I decided to give the pho dac biet and spring rolls a try.  I was happy to see a pot of jasmine tea waiting for me when I put down the menu.\n\nSpring rolls were good and was satisfying.  The pho has a nice light broth.  I like light broth.  Didn't feel too overly heavy and I can I feel I can enjoy it perfectly without hoisin sauce.  Portions were great and huge. The beef was good, it had chicken in it which I thought was good, and I am happy to say they use the good meatballs.  Other pho places I go to don't use the correct meatballs.  I finished my entire bowl.  \n\nThe place is small.  Restrooms are basically closets.  I get hit by the door every time I go into the restroom.  But hey, I found it to be clean.  \n\nThe decor was nothing special and they had Vietnamese music playing in the background.   They have the recognizable chairs that you see in most Vietnamese restaurants.  Everything about this place reminded me of home back in San Diego.  I felt the food was good and satisfying.  The people there were nice, checked up on us, and they were conversating with other guests even with their broken English.  I thought that was cute.  Prices here are a tad cheaper than other places.  Cash Only probably has to do with that. \n\nOverall, I found my experience here pleasant.  I liked the pho and I will definitely be back to give the other dishes a try.","Best place for pho in the city. I have tried them all and this is the one I always come back to for more. The woman who takes your order is quick and abrupt, but she is very friendly once you get to know her. I love the little old man who seats you when you come in the door, and serves you tea. You have to ask for water if you want it. I love the tofu in lemongrass curry as an appetizer. The sauce is so good I wish I could put it on everything. I usually get pho with chicken or the special\nSpicy soup. The ingredients are always so fresh and just taste so healthy. The food is very flavorful and perfect after a weekend of riding my snowboard. If you are looking for authentic pho then this is the place to go!","I love this place because it really reminds me of my time in Vietnam.  It's not the classiest joint by quite a stretch, but it took me back to sitting in Pho restaurants or street vendors in Saigon.  Man, I bet I ate at least four bowls of the stuff a day.  Take that for what you will, and I'm sure it's not for everybody.  For those peeps, there is a PF Changs at the Waterfront for you.  There are a few other Vietnamese places that I've tried and really enjoyed, but this place will always be close to my heart.","I am about to make a bold statement; Pho Minh is better than Tram's (and I love Tram's).\n\nI had the chicken pho, and it was absolutely amazing. The summer rolls were fantastic as well, and the owners of Pho Minh are delightful people. I will be going back for pho very, very soon.","I'm a big fan of Pho and this is the best in Pittsburgh. The papaya salad is also outstanding. The meat and rice dishes are tasty and the spring rolls are delicious. I can't wait to go back.","The pho is excellent! Good portion, price. The rare beef was rare, unlike most places. The soup was very flavorful and delicately spiced, and you get all the types of condiments you could possibly want. Combine that with the good service - especially that friendly old man. The free tea served in ceramic adds to the feeling of authenticity.\n\nThe haters on these reviews probably aren't from around here. You can't compare this to little saigon or something - not the right locale or resources. But it's pretty damn good.","I just graduated from CMU and the thing that I miss most about Pittsburgh is Pho Minh.  Their pho is unbelievable and their #4 (pork spring roll) is equally as amazing.  Moreover, Pho Minh completely trumps Tram's Kitchen.\n\nI took my parents here for my \"last meal\" before leaving the City and they loved it, too.  They aren't into 'ethnic food' at all.  That being said, I would take ANYONE here.  Their grilled chicken (#30 something) is perfect for people who dislike pho.  \n\nIt's a must if you're anywhere near Pittsburgh.","Yea yea yea Tram's is great tra la la but the pho here is better! The broth, noodles, and beef are all tastier. And their other noodle dishes have always been delicious. My first choice for Vietnamese food in Pittsburgh\n\n\nAnd everyone knows the main reason you go to Tram's is to see the  one-armed dude.","Had dinner at Pho Minh again last night, after having had a wonderful time meeting some of the Pittsburgh Yelp gang and Rachel, our new local Yelp ambassador. I didn't say much about the food in my previous review, so thought I'd rectify that. \n\nI'm a big fan of Vietnamese bun, which is a dish made with rice noodles and some kind of grilled meat, usually served in a big bowl with sprouts, cukes, scallions, peanuts, cilantro, lettuce and carrots. What I'm looking for when I order this is meat (I usually get chicken) that has been well marinated, as this lends alot of the flavor to this dish. Pho Minh marinates theirs in hoisin and maybe other things, and it's delicious. They add a little of this sauce to the noodles and garnish with the salad, then serve it with their wonderful fish sauce. This is a dish I crave. Their veggies are really fresh, the meat is succulent, and all of the flavors complement eachother so well. I like a deep fried spring roll with my bun, so I always order one, and they slice it and serve it right in the bowl. These are great here...really meaty little rolls. They use pork, and it's almost like a pork meatball filling. When you order these as an appetizer you get 2 of them and a side of their molasses/fish sauce combo. Doug had the Hu tieu xao, which is chicken, shrimp and veggies stir fried with rice noodles. This dish has some funky Vietnamese flavors, and has fish sauce as a base for the stir fry sauce, so you have to like that, but if you do, this dish rocks. Like all of their food, it was very well prepared and delicious. The woman who waits tables here always offers us their traditional mung bean pudding dessert, and we always say yes. This is a sweet and starchy treat served hot with a lacing of coconut milk. I love it. Tea comes to the table automatically and is free, and they offer some nice hot and iced beverages in addition. We didn't have the pho on this visit, but I will reiterate that it's great. I think this is the best Vietnamese restaurant in Pittsburgh.\n\nThis is a family owned and operated restaurant, so you will see the same friendly faces when you become a regular. Early on we learned to say hello/good afternoon in Vietnamese ( xin chao, pronounced shin chow) and we always get a big smile from the older gentleman who owns the place.

I am rating it 4 stars and not 5 for one thing, the focaccia. They now stick it in pizza box and you can't see what your getting. The last 2 times I got it, the bread was burnt. At the price of this bread it shouldn't be burnt and it never was when you could see it before you got it home. I think I will stick to what I can see.","The only reason to shop here is that going anywhere else is out of your way. The prices our worse than other GE stores and I wonder why. The produce is not very fresh and the meats never looks good . The store never looks very clean. I was hopeful a couple of years ago when the store was refurbished and it was nicer for a while but now it's back to it's old ways. I have friends that refuse to go there because of the scary parking lot where people sell \"things\" out of their cars and at the driveway exit. If there is outside cameras, the Pgh police should take a look. I wish there was an alternative to shop in the northside. Kuhns off Brighton rd is about the same except the prices are better.","Went to this store today and it was worse than usual . Jitneys were all parked up in the handicapped parking spaces because it was raining. The one guy was walking back to his car next to me and as he pulled his keys out of his pocket a baggie corner filled with some brown stuff fell out right in front of me. I had seen him pocket something from a man that sits at the driveway exit. He did pick it up really fast. Then I saw a young man in a tie from the store go over to the guy that was selling this stuff and they shook hands and were laughing and yacking with each other  This is in the middle of the day. I'm too scared to shop there after dark.","Was going to try the buffalo pizza. Tried to call about 9:15 pm Saturday night and they didn't even pick up the phone. They'er menu says that they are open til 10pm  Disappointed again! No longer going to try.","In the past, I have not really been much of a fan of Ron's as another reviewer has said that the food was inconsistent. But I have tried it 3 times in the last 3-4 months because a neighbor told me that they had gotten rid of a cook and replaced him. These three times have been a pleasant surprise. The Pizza was well put together and cooked right, wings are hot and also cooked well. I have had the Italian hoagy 2 times and both times the meat was plentiful and the veggies fresh. I don't agree with the other reviewer that it was all that cheap, but maybe the increase in cost is reflected in the better quality of the food. I have tried many pizza joints on the northside and I think this is one of the best. \nThis is take out and delivery only. No seating.","I really don't know how this place got any good reviews. One big problem is that the place is dirty, the carpets, the lighting above the tables and the furniture. I have tried this place 5 times in the past 2 years and this is how it went. The 1st time I had a burger which tasted funny and I didn't finish it. I got food poisoning and was so sick. This I thought might have been a stomach flu so I did try this place again. The 2nd time I was with some friends from the neighborhood and 3/5 of us had the spaghetti and meatballs and we got food poisoning.Now I'm thinking that they have a hygiene problem with the ground meat. I was going to stay away from the place but a friend from Troy hill liked to stop there because it was close to her home. No problem,next time I got french fries with gravy. How could this be a problem?.When they got to the table they had put cold canned gravy on my fries.When I told the waitress about it she took it back to the kitchen and microwaved it till it was the heat of lava. Needless to say I refused to pay for them. The 4th time my friend dragged me there, I had a salad. I didn't get sick but it wasn't anything special with bagged salad mix and a couple of under ripe tomato pieces and cucumber. The last time I only got a slice of pie and this was good. I no longer have to go to Billy's, my dear friend has passed away and I refuse to go anywhere near the place. To the owner-Please sell the restaurant, you obviously don't care for the place or know how to handle food safely."],"type":["High Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Medium

I had a horrible experience.  Vowed never to go back!  At that time, I even had a terrible interaction with the owner.\n\nThis time I was invited with a couple of girlfriends because they love it. Decided to try again since it was more about the \"get together\" than the food/location.\n\nThis time, overpriced food and bad service.  Overall, it was not anything out of the ordinary and not worth the price.   I had the veal speciality.   Large portion, but ok.  Staff was not very attentive for the small amount of customers present.\n\nI am a Pittsburgh native.  This is a bad neighborhood. \n\nI am NOT interested in ever going back!","No better in taste than a Fazoli or even an Olive Garden.  Inflated prices, like the cheapest entree was $40, try to disguise this place as something it is not.  Went with a group of co workers, so we pretty much got everything on the menu and not one thing stuck out really good.  Service is incredibly slow.  Not worth it at all.  Even if you tell yourself that atleast the portions are large, the food is just not good enough to warrant wasting a meal eating there.","The menu online gives no prices, and the entrees are ridiculously overpriced for what you get - a good meal, but far too much food, and nothing extraordinary. The entrees are $50 - $60. BE WARNED - if you want atmosphere to go with your $60 entree, you'd better REQUEST DOWNSTAIRS! Otherwise you can have your anniversary dinner in a small room in front of large televisions. Who knew? And the staff will definitely not accommodate your request for a more romantic spot - even if they know it is your tenth anniversary! Wow. Should have walked out.","I do not say this with many 2 star ratings but I would like to go back for another try.  The reason is simple, in reading the reviews below, I have to assume we hit Alla Famigilia on a bad night, at least I hope so.  The main reason for the low rating was the service.  We were seated on the third floor which is their bar area, at a high top table and the bar tender was our server.  She had to mix drinks for every table on the third floor, tend to the patrons at the bar and come around to wait on our table.  That was not fair to her and definitely not fair to us.  Her service and attentiveness lacked for obvious reasons but even when she was \"free\" she walked by our table without a glance and was apparently hard of hearing.  Furthermore, when ever one person got her attention for another drink or something, she said okay and left, without giving anyone else a chance to order.  The rest of the staff tried to pick up the slack a little but they were jammed as well.  Sounds weird, but I never felt so rushed in a 3 hour dinner.  The food took awhile, which is fine and expected on a busy Saturday night, just keep the drinks flowing and stop by once in a awhile so we don't notice.\n\nI also did not like that we were seated at a high top table.  I love the high tops for drinks and a few apps but for a 3 hour meal, these were uncomfortable, especially if your legs didn't hit the chair cross bars correctly (either too short or too tall).\n\nThe food was good, very good in some instances and disappointing in one.  I loved the pasta with Vodka sauce and the salad, both part of the entree which is unusual for a high end restaurant.  The meatball appetizer and the calamari and shrimp appetizer were the best things I ate all evening.  The biggest disappointment was the veal chop.  I love a good bone in veal chop but was leaning towards a seafood dish. I ended up changing my mind right before I ordered as I saw the veal chop brought out to another table and it looked amazing.  The disappointment was it was over-cooked.  It came out medium well at best (closer to well) and for $68, and for the amount they were serving that night, they should know how to cook them to perfection.  Not a spot of pink to be found.  No one even asked us during our meal if everything was okay or any issues.  When most of the chop remained on my plate and everyone else's entree was 90% eaten, not even a \"was everything okay\".  Just clear me out and get on with the next one.\n\nI hope to have the opportunity to go back and I will not be seated in the third floor bar area and I will not get my same waitress and give it another try.  I expected so much more.","We had the mushrooms, meatball appetizer, pasta, salad, veal piccata and spaghetti with clam sauce. A nice pasta dish with roasted veggies and marinara was made as a special order. But I was not wowed by this restaurant. Large portions are not enough to impress me. The tastes were good, but for the prices, I'd expect better. If you're a big meat eater, or love to eat huge amounts of pasta, ok, this is great. But the sauces were just ok, nothing spectacular. Spaghetti with clams was covered with red pepper flakes but not noted as such on the menu. Would you like someone to cover your pizza slice with red pepper flakes without asking? I'm sure the deserts are good but we didn't have any - but the sizes of the appetizers and entrees is just over the top, but not worth the premium prices to me.","The food was delicious. But it is a ridiculously expensive restaurant. If you're intimidated by spending $100 or more on a complete meal for 1 person, then this is not the place for you. Knowing that we had other plans for our evening, my date and I cut the meal short with appetizers, salad, and a bottle of one of the lesser expensive wines they offer, which was $54 a bottle. Our check was still $120, and we left hungry. Which is a shame, because the little of what we did have, we fully enjoyed. There are plenty of Italian restaurants in Pittsburgh, and many of them are very, very good - where one can enjoy a meal for a fraction of what it costs here.","This used to be my secret place, but I've told so many people about it that I have a hard time getting a reservation.  I've known Jonathan (chef/owner) for a few years and he's done some good improvements.  He's added a bar upstairs which is very cool and they also have a patio that's great.  I had a dinner party there in the summer and have another one planned in March and Jonathan totally goes the extra effort to make it special.  He arranged for a dj last time, so we were able to dance off some of his food.  Okay, the food is great.  I especially recommend the Veal Chop.  The staff is awesome. I really like Marney and Errol (two main servers) and I like Jordan the bartender upstairs (Marney's daughter).  I'd like to give this place 5 stars, but it has a few smaller problems.  It's a little bit pricey.  The good is that the cost does include salad, pasta, and bread, but the bad is that you'll easily spend $50 on an entree.  The Veal Chop is $65.  That's a little much, especially considering the location.  The dishes also which are delicious are simply toooooo big.  I mean literally you can three meals out of one entree,  I would suggest some smaller plates especially for the bar.  One last tip, even though it's not BYOB anymore, you can still BYOB.  He won't turn you away.  This is one of my favorite restaurants.  The chef is really talented and I'd hazard a guess that if he was in New York he could be a celebrity chef if he wanted.  He's got the personality.","The food is unforgettable, but unfortunately so is the bill.  Sicilian themed with fresh ingredients in an intimate setting all prepared in an open kitchen.\n\nAsk before you order a special, or you might be stunned when you are handed the check. But if you love food and money is no object, this is your place. A great place for Valentine's day or a special anniversary splurge, with the emphasis on the word 'splurge'.","Old school Italian. Enough said. This place sets the standard for great Italian food.\nThe meatballs are a muct have and the pastas are incredible.\nI had a veal chop with long hots. It just doesn't get any better.\nAnd don't miss the tiramisu. As good as it gets.","First, the Veal Milanese is easily the best veal chop I've had anywhere. Ever. And I've had plenty of veal.  Second, the veal chop is definitely in my top 5 favorite dishes I've ever had, ever. \n\nFantastic restaurant. The relatively new chef has made this place even better than it was. This is THE most underrated restaurant on Yelp in Pittsburgh. Great service, extremely friendly staff, fantastic atmosphere.\n\nBe sure to come hungry. You cannot leave unsatisfied. Meals typically last me 3-4 hours, but I take my time. BYOB is a bonus too. \n\nIn summary, Alla Famiglia is consistently the best restaurant in Pittsburgh. Try it if you have not, and you won't be disappointed.","I have been frequenting Alla Famiglia since 2007 and it is still my favorite Italian restaurant in Pittsburgh and perhaps my favorite in the world!  \n\nChef Jonathan is a genius - his \"Veal Chop Milanese\" with lump crab, toasted pine nuts, and lemon is the BEST I've ever had.  Every time we eat here, my husband orders this dish and refuses to try anything else - that's how AMAZING it is.  \n\nI have tried a variety of entrees - everything from the the Veal Chop Pizzaiolo to the Steak il pizzaiolo to the Medallions of veal Pomodoro ai Pepperoni.  Each dish is infused with deliciousness that makes these entrees OUT OF THIS WORLD!  \n\nYou have got to try the following:  mozzarella (apptz), hot peppers (apptz), mozzarella stuffed meatball (apptz), vodka pasta (automatically received with your meal - sauce is delicious), veal chop milanese (entr\u00e9e).  \n\nYou won't be disappointed - the kitchen is open so you can even watch as Chef Jonathan prepares your dinner.  \n\nMake a reservation.  Neighborhood is a bit sketchy so be careful.  \n\nPS.  I've taken all my friends, family, and business partners (many who do not live in Pittsburgh) here and everyone absolutely loves it and wishes they lived in Pitt so they could come here more often.  In fact, we no longer live in Pittsburgh, but every time we come into town for a visit, we HAVE to eat dinner at our favorite Alla Famiglia!","This is my second review of Alla Famalgia and again this place gets five stars. I loved every part of my meal. I started out with the twelve ounce stuffed meatball and the truffled mushroom appetizers. The waiter invited me to watch as the mushrooms were being prepared at the kitchen counter. There I chatted with the chef as he prepared my app. Explaining as he went on, first slicing fresh chantrel, portobellos, and button mushrooms. Next he saut\u00e9 them in olive oil, added brown sugar, brandy, raisins, and finished it with heavy cream. They were fantastic. There were a variety of specials including wild boar chops, a risotto with prawns, scallops, and black truffles. But I chose the dry aged filet with lump crab in a leek cream. It was the best piece of filet I've ever had. It was easily a pound of beef and a half pound of crab in a light cream sauce with leeks. I could barely touch it after the pasta, salad, bread, and appetizers. I brought my leftovers home and have them another time. Dessert consisted of a nice portion of carrot cake with an apricot cream cheese icing with apricot jam filling. It was a nice take on an old favorite. For the four of us the bill was over 300 dollars, but well worth it for the attentive service and extremely well prepared food.","Spent the weekend in the city with some friends. This was our first time to Alla Famiglia.  Unbelievable!!!  We enjoyed everything.  If you are looking for high quality food with a great friendly staff, this is it.  It is a little out of the way but it is worth the trip.  If I had the option to give 6 stars I would do it.   Very impressive.","While visiting the Pittsburgh area, my wife and I were intrigued by the excellent reviews we found of Alla Familgia.  While it was a bit of a drive from Cranberry Township, we needed a dining reprieve after a disappointing visit at BRAVO! Cucina Italiana.  East Warrington Avenue is undergoing major construction which made finding parking a bit difficult, fortunately there is valet service in a lot to the side of the restaurant which we took advantage of.  \nUpon entering, we were warmly welcomed by the host.  We visited on a stormy evening and were fortunate to find that some reservations had been cancelled due to the weather, which enabled us to get a table.  I strongly advise to get reservations in advance.  We were seated on the first floor with a view of the chefs cooking.  Awesome.\nAll that has been said in prior reviews, I heartily agree with.  The bread, cheese, and dipping oil was a delicious start.  Ingredients were fresh.  The pasta and main course dishes were done perfectly.  My wife had the Gorgonzola Filet Mignon, which she described as one of the best meals she has ever eaten.\nWhen we are in the area, we'll be back.","I was in Pittsburgh (my hometown) for a visit from Boston.  I was so pleased with the meal at this restaurant.  It was by far the best restaurant I have ever been to in the Burgh.  The wait staff, chef, food, was stellar.  We are known for very good restaurants in Boston and this restaurant could be in Boston or NYC it is that fantastic!  I would highly recommend going here if you have a special occasion, date night, or just want a superb meal.","FACT: Thee best Italian meal I've had in the Burgh, hands down!\nFACT: I ate so much I thought they would have to wheel me out on a stretcher.\nFACT: It's a serious hidden gem in a slightly sketchy neighborhood.\n\nNeed some more info, because I'm comin' atcha with the goods! To start they set the table with \"Holy Oil,\" which is banana pepper olive oil for dipping Italian bread in, a seasoned cecci bean and cheese gustoso and a goat cheese and olive spread. I wish they sold that banana pepper olive oil because I wanted to have it every day of my life! \n\nWe ordered the famous Meatball appetizer. This meatball is for serious! It's massive and stuffed with mozzarella cheese. Yep, I'm for realz. It was just oozing Italian sexiness, in a ball. As soon as I tasted the red sauce, it tasted like my Grandma's, which sparked fond memories and made me want to actually live in this place. \n\nWe also ordered the Trifolata, which is assorted mushrooms and currants in marsala cream. It was also incredible. The bad/good of it was that it wasn't really needed because they give you so much food, but it was delicious, so whatever!\n\nFor the Third course they serve you your choice of pasta either with their famous home made vodka sauce or fettucini. But here's the thing, the fettucini is made in front of you... in a cheese wheel. Yep, I'm for realz again! I know I'm crazy for not ordering it, but I really love me some vodka sauce and was incredibly happy with this amazing homemade sauce. My hubby got the fetticini and loved it. See, we're all happy here!\n\nFourth course is a salad with red vinagariette, roasted red peppers, candied walnuts, golden raisens and gargonzola cheese. It wasn't memorable amongst all the bangin' dishes but not too shabby at all.\n\nFor the Fifth course (and when I finally tapped out) I ordered the Cioppino with shrimp, mussels, clams, scallops and fish in a saffron and tomato broth with sambuca. It matched all the other dishes. Just incredible. Loved the broth, loved the succulent scallop (just one, but I can't complain, I was stuffed by that point!), the shrimp was jumbo and the fish was perfectly cooked. And the garlic bread was excellent.\n\nWhenever anyone says things are expensive, I usually think they're talking $30 a plate. But, this place is legit expensive. Think $50 (ish) a plate. But what I can tell you is it was 100% worth it! We had leftovers for two days! Talk about an Italian hospitality. Which, by the way, the service was exceptional, but I would have expected that here. \n\nA perfect special night out, if you don't mind unbuckling a couple notches in front of your dining companion, of course!","Absolutely incredible restaurant! It is by far my favorite restaurant in the city. Everything about this place is fantastic especially their Veal Chop Milanese, the restaurant is pretty pricey but 100% well worth the money. I recommend this restaurant to anyone who is looking for a fantastic Italian meal.","This is my favorite place to eat!  The greens and beans, the meatball, and the hot cheese for appetizers are excellent.  I love the pasta with a dash of the oil they give you. The Alfredo in the cheese wheel is an excellent alternative to red sauce.   I've tried just about every dish there and never had a bad meal.  The Veal Chop is by far my favorite.  Huge portions which usually come home!! ;)\nThe atmosphere is a very quaint three story house, use valet parking, because the area is not the best! Lol but the police station is a cross the street. So it's all good!   \nThis is the perfect place for a great meal with great service for any function or just date night!","Possibly the best Italian Restaurant I've ever been too.  The Vodka Sauce was phenomenal.  I finished the evening with a  Fernet Branca.....perfection.","This is one of if not the best meals I have ever had.   I have only gone as part of work functions (about 3 different occasions) and every time we get the upstairs private room.  The service is fantastic.  I always have the Veal Chop Milanese which is AMAZING.  They also have a delicious pasta as an appetizer which has a little spice to it.  You will not find a better meal in Pittsburgh.  I have no idea what the prices actually are as I have never paid but it is definitely very pricey.  The neighborhood is real grimey but don't let that dissuade you from going there.","Their prices are exorbitant but so worth it. I've only had Italian this good in NY, LA, and Italy. No wonder there are pictures of celebrities all over the walls. What a hidden gem. $260 for two? Money well spent.","UPDATED: Just wanted to share that we attempted to visit for a third time when my husband's brother was in town in mid-November of 2014.  We had reservations for 7:30 on a Tuesday, so we obviously figured we would be seated immediately.  The brother and his girlfriend arrived a couple minutes before the reservation and were told to go up to the bar while they set the table and wait for the rest of the party.  I arrived about a minute after and my husband a few minutes behind me as he needed to park due to the lack of valet during the week.  There was no one at the host stand when either of us came in.  So we went up to the bar, declined a drink... and waited, and waited.  The bartender soon became deeply involved in picking a wine for a couple at the bar, not his fault.  The brother eventually was able to flag down a waitress to ask if she could check on our table.  She looked very annoyed.  She eventually went over to the phone at the bar, called down, hung up the phone and said, dead pan, \"no, it's not ready yet.\"  Not a smile, not a sorry, not a \"can we get you a drink on the house?\" Meanwhile, there was an open table for 4 on that floor.  The bartender eventually told us \"that's for a reservation.\" \"Yes, we have a reservation... for 25 minutes ago.\"  \"They must have specifically requested that table.\"  They did, however, offer us the table right next to the door on the first floor though - the one with the 10 degree breeze coming in that night.  No thank you.  We were very insulted by the lack of table for our reservation, but more so by the lack of acceptable service.  We decided to leave and spend $20 on pizza instead of $100+ per person and enjoyed much better service.. which is never the way it should be.  Hopefully they solve this problem soon.  We'll give it one more go when the insult has worn off.\n\nMy husband won't hesitate to tell you what his favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh is: Alla Famiglia.  And to be honest, these days I agree with him!  \n\nWhile my husband enjoys many of the more \"up and coming\" restaurants with smaller portions and interesting flavor combinations, he often finds himself longing for the same quality food with better cuts of meat and bigger portions.  This is where we satisfy both of our appetites for big flavor and, well, big portions.  But to reduce Alla Famiglia to those two things alone would not do it justice.\n\nLet's start out instead with addressing the two biggest critiques of this place: its location and the price.  Yes, it is in Allentown, but they also have plenty of parking and valet if you prefer.  Honestly, we drive almost everywhere to get dinner, so this is not an issue for us.  The other thing I always hear about is how expensive it is.  Some of those complaints come from people who I know have no problem giving their money to the big steakhouse chains, while getting a lot less value.  No, it is not cheap.  You will likely pay upwards of $50 for your entry.  The veal chops are close to $70.  But, that's not all you get.  You get delicious, fresh baked bread, a spread, dipping oil and gustoso for same, a delicious salad, and homemade pasta served family style.  If you wanted to be especially frugal, you could approach this place like an Olive Garden senior special: feast on the freebies and take your entree to go.  But, even if you're full, it may be too difficult not to savor the meal as it comes out...\n\nI've been here twice and my husband has been here three times (lucky - he got to go for work and he said they ordered almost every appetizer, all of which were apparently delicious).  The first time I ordered the filet with gorgonzola.  It was one of the most delicious and largest filets I've ever had.  My husband ordered a veal chop with prosciutto which I don't think I recognized on the current menu, but he absolutely loved it.  The veal chop is one of the largest bone-in cuts of meat I've seen and the sear on it was absolutely perfect.  We also ordered the mussels, which were spicy and delicious, and the meatball appetizer, which I remember being tasty, but nothing too out of the ordinary.  I think there are other things on the menu to try first. \n\nThe second time we came I ordered the Milanese veal chop, breaded, slightly citrusy, and absolutely heavenly.    He had the cowboy ribeye which was also large and an absolutely beautiful cut of meat.  The husband has a thing about fatty cuts and avoiding anything that is the least bit chewy, and he barely had to leave a piece on his plate.  We also got the calamari appetizer, which was perfectly, lightly fried with a savory, garlic sauce that sets it apart from the sweet sauces often served with calamari.\n\nFinally, I should note that the service we have received here has always been exceptional.  Everyone is always professional and courteous.","After a friend told me about her wonderful experience here, I knew I had to go. I also knew that it wasn't really in my budget. Well, lucky for me an old college friend of mine decided that he was coming to town for a visit. I sent him the websites for various restaurants and when he saw Alla Famiglia he said, \"Oh honey. Make the reservation - I've got it.\"  YES! I knew I kept him around for some reason!\n\nSo on a cold, snowy Saturday night, we trudged up the mountain. And it was glorious.\n\nFirst off, it IS in a bit of a sketchy neighborhood. But no worries - they have valet, so you don't have to deal with trying to find somewhere to park and walking around.\n\nThe Holy Oil is the best thing I've ever dipped bread into - and I'm a dipper. I come from an Italian family - we dip everything into everything - bread into sauce, cookies into coffee, bread into coffee, etc. This is by far the best dipping experience I've ever had.\n\nOnto the MEATBALL. We got the mozzarella-stuffed meatball for our appetizer. The meatball was good. The sauce was great. There isn't much more I can say about it, to be honest. It was just so, so yummy.\n\nSalad course: Great salad!\n\nPasta course: So, I was slightly disappointed that they did not give us a choice. I was really looking forward to the fettuccine in the cheese wheel that I had read about here! Alas, only vodka sauce. Great vodka sauce, though. I should've asked about that damn cheese wheel...\n\nFor the main course, I got the veal chop milanese and it was perfect. My friend got the cioppino and he enjoyed that very much.\n\nI could not even think about eating dessert. We had so much food. I took 1/2 of my pasta course and 3/4 of my main course home. I really wish I had gotten a dessert to go and eaten it later, though. \n\nI really cannot wait to go again.","I was in Pittsburgh my home town for a recent stay.  Alla Famiglia is the best restaurant I have been to in the Burgh.  It was consistent with the type of upscale dining I have gotten used to in Boston and I was pleasantly surprised.  The area surrounding the restaurant does not seem to be the safest locale, but worth going there for a wonderful dinner.  The service was exceptional!  The food was amazing with cheese plates, bread and side for the bread basket, meatball appetizer, cowboy steak with gorgonzola, and the halibut.  The tiramisu was the best I have had.  The addition of BYOB was a hidden gem as well.  I would highly recommend this for a special night out to celebrate.  Fantastic restaurant.","Simply outstanding...we had a large group (11) and everything was perfect. Several comments that this was the best Italian cuisine several of our group had experienced anywhere in the world.  Can't wait to go back!\n\nThe famous Meatball app did not disappoint (my fav was the stuffed peppers) and the many preparations of veal (main courses) were all exquisite.  \n\nAbsolutely recommend for any and all who are considering this fantastic establishment!","Just recently returned. PHENOMENAL meal! Glenn our waiter was superb. Loved the veal dishes.  I also enjoyed the new cocktail menu. One of the drinks was iced coffee with orangicello and frangelica cream. DELICIOUS!","This restaurant was phenomenal.   We went for my wife's 30th birthday with a large group of people and it was a great experience.  \n\nThe meatball and fried cheese appetizers were really good.  The marinara that came with the meatball was the best I have ever had.\n\nDon't go here if you are in a rush, because the entire dining experience will take several hours.  But we were there to enjoy the night, so we did not care.\n\nI would definitely recommend this to anyone as long as you are willing to spend the money.  If you do  appetizers, drinks and dinner it will run about $100 a person.  But I thought it was well worth it.\n\nThe wait staff was great.  Our server was Emmett and we had a lot of fun with him.  The owner/chef even came out and chatted with us on the upstairs outdoor patio.","My favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. Always delicious and I always order a different entree.

hotel and not really having eaten much all day, I was hungry.\n\nThe service was terrible....no one knew what they were doing so it took 10 minutes to get a freaking slice of pizza and then when said pizza came it was NASTY.\n\nMy husband once got a pizza in Milwaukee where they put Kraft singles on it as cheese and Pizza Parma is just behind that for worst pizza ever.","Looking for a quick bite to eat and a local told me this was \"the best pizza in the city.\"  I got a plain slice and a pepperoni slice. Possibly the worst pizza I have ever eaten.  This wouldn't even qualify as pizza in North Jersey.  I ate half of the plain slice because I was starving....then threw both in the garbage.  \n\nIf this is really the best pizza in Pittsburgh... wow.","I ordered from Pizza Parma out of storm necessity. I ordered a chicken parmigiana \"hoagie\", which was dry and luke warm. The potato bacon soup was like something out of a can, except the chunks of potato were hard and undercooked..all pretty nasty and overly salty.\n\nNever order from them.","Zero stars. Came in 10 mins before close. Female manager on duty asked for $100 in exchange for a pizza. When we refused she said she could not serve us because her employees had been working since 9am..,it is currently 2:00 am... Sounds pretty illegal to me","Average pizza. But with ten guys working - and not much business at the moment - it still took twenty minutes to get a slice of pepperoni. I'll walk across the street next time.","My butthole hasn't been right for days, nor my stomach. \n\nWe ordered in because we all had a long day and were set to have a family movie night.\n\nA pizza and hoagie. \n\nThe hoagie wasn't anything to run and go scream from the rooftops about but the pizza was covered in little ass ruining intestinal demons and this I am nearly sure of.\n\nI had to be talked out of sending pizza Parma a bill for several rolls of toilet paper.\n\nBe weary of the pizza, distrustful actually.\n\nYour butthole will thank me for it!","Hubby and I dropped in after a hellish morning at the Social Security office. Hubby loves pizza so we made a stop.\n\nPizza wan't bad, it was actually pretty decent. But the place was disgusting and the cashier was incredibly rude.","I eat this pizza all the time when downtown, usually when running around at events like First Night or the Gallery Crawls...not the best pizza I have ever had in my life, but it's not bad!  And I haven't ever gotten sick from it.  Just wanted to offer a different opinion.","PIzza Parma's decent tasting mega-big-2ft-long hot sausage hoagie was let down by the piss poor attitude of the staff, the lack of cleanliness of the tables and floor, the out-of-order red door restroom, the bright yellow for no-explicable reason walls. \n\nThe large color-striped 80's retro tables and green chairs have come back in style but this win is purely accidental and achieved only by laziness and lack of renovation.\n\nThat is all.","My fiance & I have lived in downtown Pittsburgh for over a year + now & this place is fabulous. \nMy sweetie LOVES LOVES LOVESSS pizza & we order from here a ton.  We haven't ordered anything here that wasn't super tasty.\nThe shop is small & the decor is super bright which makes you want to get in & out quickly but who the hell eats in there anyways. ... you're grabbing your order & running.","I'm glad I listened to my friend's recommendation and not some of these bad reviews. We're just in town for the night and wanted something delivered to our hotel. They said it would take an hour, which I expected on Super Bowl Sunday right at game time, but it was here in less than half an hour. \n\nThe pizza was delicious! Just the right balance of cheese and a tasty sauce, generous with the toppings, and a nicely crispy crust but not too thin.","This place has great service! My best friend and I got 2 custom orders and the older guy in back came out to the register to take our orders personally.  I assume he's either the cook, owner, or both. We ordered 2 cheeselss pizzas; a lot of places mess this up. Pizza Parma however, makes great cheeseless pizza. Our personal pizzas were nice and toasty, not over nor undercooked, and it was not dried out at all! There was more than enough sauce mmmmmmmmm.","My fiance & I have lived in downtown Pittsburgh for over a year + now & this place is fabulous. \nMy sweetie LOVES LOVES LOVESSS pizza & we order from here a ton.

Upon arrival we immediately were ignored so we ended up seating ourselves. \n\nThe place was unacceptably dirty, our table was dirty the floor was dirty, heck even the walls seemed to have a layer of grime. Both the waitress and the bartender were extremely  rude. \n\nMy mom and I got a beer and my dad tried to order a martini, immediately we received dirty looks from both the bartender and the waitress, they said they didn't have them so my dad asked for straight vodka in a glass to which she brought a shot  of vodka instead. I understand it's not a full bar or a classy place but to serve alcohol and react the way the servers did was ridiculous!\n\n I ordered a grilled fish sandwich that lacked flavor and was horrible greasy, the fried scallops were disgusting.\n\nI understand that the restaurant has seen better days but wow, will i be going back, methinks not!","Went to the Steelers vs Ravens playoff game with a friend from NJ.  While waiting for the game to start we wanted some oysters.  We looked up oyster bar on our phones and low & behold, there was the original Oyster House only 0.5 miles away from our hotel.  We were so happy that we walked right over. First thing they said to us was, we only accept cash.  Ok, not a problem, old fashioned perhaps but we wanted fresh oysters on the half shell.  Guess what, no fresh oysters.  We proceeded to order some fried oysters, fish, onion rings and a few beers.  The oysters were still frozen in the middle, the fish was undercooked and the onion rings were terrible.  The beer was cold and that is the only reason they got one star.  I was embarrassed because he was my guest and it was my idea.  I don't recommend if you want good food.  If a cold beer is all you want, go for it.  Otherwise, stay away!","My fianc\u00e9 have lived in Pittsburgh for about a year and a half and this was by far the worst food and service we've had living here. \n\nWe had high hopes for the fresh oysters. When they arrived they were served in little plastic Dixie cup shooters and were flavorless and gelatinous.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 did like her fish sandwhich but when she told the server she gave her regular Pepsi instead of diet our server rolled her eyes and stormed off.\n\nI do not recommend this restaurant. Please support good food and service in Pittsburgh elsewhere.","Hey oyster house! Do you remember me!?  I was the girl who came in tonight, alone, around 8pm! I had a camera bag and a side braid? No, of course you don't because I wasn't acknowledged as a human being! Apparently if you are a single diner you don't deserve to have your order taken or even seated. \n\nI walked in here tonight and wasn't greeted, then stood awkwardly in the door way for a few minutes until the bar tender asked if he could help me. I said I'd like a table and he told me to wait for a waitress. Still nothing. No one came over. \nThen I was handed a menu by the bar tender and sat myself at a table. 20 minutes later, nothing. Even when a family was seated immediately next to me, the waitress took their order and didn't even look at me as I stared at her face and got to point where I had to wave the menu around to get her attention. Nothing. \n\nEventually I had enough and left, which they still probably didn't notice. \n\nMake sure to bring a huge group of people if you do make the mistake to eat here, because that's the only way this backwards place will give you any respect. \n\nIf not, and you're alone, don't waste 30 minutes here without being acknowledged like I did.","Avoid at all costs ! The staff is rude and Ms Piggy ( as another customer referred to her as ) refused to serve our kids dessert while we had a drink at the bar. If you go you will leave disappointed ! I'm surprised they lasted a month let alone 100 years.","This restaurant is horrible.  The waitress was rude and tried to rush us.  The only oyster on the menu is a terrible patty of some kind.  How can you call yourself an Oyster House and not serve either fried oysters or raw???  The food overall was ok.  I would never go or eat there again!","We stopped here expecting them to have raw bar options as their name would imply.  However, they have several cooked selections. That said, we only stopped into this location for a drink and then moved on.\n\nThe restaurant includes outdoor seating and a long straight bar that extends from the front of the restaurant to the rear.  Overall, the interior isn't spectacular, but has several nostalgic photos of famous people (both local and national), some of the photos autographed.\n\nTheir drink selection is simple with many local brews and mass produced American beers.","I love crab cakes. Whenever they are on the menu I have to order it. I got the crab cake sandwich to feed my need for carbs on carbs. The crab cake tasted fine but in the end it was more filler then it was crab. When I eat a crab cake I want it to mostly be the main event filled with large chunks of crab. Sadly this one didn't do that for me.","The atmosphere is charming and the service very friendly... but the cash only gimmick isn't advertised and food is ok at best, the prices are super cheap and probably a great place to grab a quick sandwich, but more like an upscale long john silvers, i would say try it out at least once, but just not for me","Well I went here with my friends and my 3 year old daughter for a dinner. I ordered the chicken tender platter with a side of fries and we had some calamari. With regards to food,it's so so,I've been with few different places in Pittsburgh that really serves good enough calamari. I've from the Philippines so i know what is good and what's great in terms of calamari. Our server was ok,she checked on us maybe twice,the only thing I can say is that she didn't tell us they only take cash and they don't take cards. I've never seen it somewhere stating they only take cash. I'm a card person. I probably have a buck or two in my wallet coz I use my cards for everything. I have ten credit cards and 2 debit cards in my wallet,good thing I remember my debit card pin,made a withdrawal,paid the atm fee and gave them cash. Imagine a place that's been around since forever and they don't take cards. Are u kidding me? Even mom and pop store accept cards.goodness. I am disappointed. We own a business so I can understand the merchant fees for card transactions but hey,it's part of operating a business. The food was ok but it's not memorable.","OK, here's what you need to know first-- they do not serve raw oysters. Where I'm from, you can't call your restaurant an \"Oyster House\" without raw oysters served, unless you want a good ass whoopin'. \n\nNothing else about this place remotely conveys \"Oyster House.\" It's a fried seafood joint, that doesn't serve Yuengling nor takes credit cards. We got all of our food on Styrofoam plates with plastic silverware. The \"waitress\" stood and watched us eat most of the meal. This particular lady had a substantial moustache and sideburns.  It was unsettling. You also have to pay before being served. \n\nThe New England Clam Chowder was good.","Awesome chowder but that's it...","Historic Place for sure, lots of old world charm. The oysters are also old, as in not fresh. The first clue is that they come pre-shucked and served in a plastic cup already in cocktail sauce to cover for the fact they have little to no taste. Cool spot for a beer and then move on to someplace to eat.","I gotta admit, the fish sandwich here is awesome!  It's deep fried so that the fat will seep into the meat of the fish!  It's totally bad for you, but the quality of the fish itself is usually good.  It is nice and tender.  You can put your own tartar sauce on it to make it as unhealthy as you want, but it's good with just some lemon on it--the way I like it!\n\nI can only eat about 1/2 the sandwich, so I usually end up cutting it in half and sharing it.","This place helped me survive my college days in the 1960's as a commuter at Duquesne University. I would walk down Forbes Ave. after class for a fish sandwich, a couple of 'oysters' and a glass of buttermilk (upgraded to a beer after I became legal). The whole thing cost me about 50 cents in those days. \nI stopped back yesterday to remember old times. The place looks largely the same, but the crowds at the bar are gone. The oyster cakes still taste  good, though; a lump of seasoned cracker meal rolled around an oyster and deep fried to a light brown. While the oyster cakes largely serve as a vehicle for hot sauce, they still taste like they used to 50 years ago. The prices are much higher, but the place still holds fond memories of Pittsburgh's working-class past, when the railroad workers would pack the bar after their shifts.\nThe Oyster House can still serve up a good lunch or afternoon snack, along with a lot of memories over a cold one.","Let's face it folks--this ain't McCormick & Schmick.  It's a dive, it's cheap, and the fish here is oh so good, providing you lower your expectations a little.  Meaning that you're not gonna get five-star cuisine but you'll get good basic chow here.  I went for the baked scrod sandwich and a side of hot sausage soup.  Trust me, if you're a soup lover like me, you'll want to come here whenever that's the soup of the day.\n\nGuess I'll be hitting the gym tonight after work.","Hmmmm, apparently I didn't get quite enough grease in my diet while in PA (you know, with all those extraneous French fries on salads and sandwiches and such).  \nThis place is pretty bare bones, CASH ONLY, and it looks like it might not have been thoroughly cleaned since it was built.  We asked for separate checks (we were here for a conference and each has an expense account to submit) and the waitress didn't seem too happy about our request.  I might add that we were the only people in the restaurant at 8pm on a Saturday.  But I digress, you wanted to know about the food, didn't you?\nIt was ALL greasy.  The crab cakes were possibly the most dense foodstuff I've ever seen.  The Fish 'n chips were like nuggets, the fried sampler was ENORMOUS and one of our guys ordered the Monster fish sandwich, yup, it was monster all right.  only about 1/3 of it fit on the bun.\nOverall it was just bland sea food.  no one was upset at the choice, but no one was raving about it either.","My grandpap loves it,\nAnd that's good enough for me.\nDon't insult him...eat.","Great fast fried seafood, cash only and a few other options.\n\nDon't be confused this place consists of two establishments and one kitchen. One is a bar with waiters and liquor, the other is a fast food style place. I chose the latter. Walk in and you will find a menu board with a few specials printed out hanging off of it, no frills, no credit cards, all local flavor.\n\nI went with the Titanic special $10.75 Which included a \"monster\" fish sandwich, and two sides, I chose fries and onion rings.\n\nEverything is made to order, which means crispy fries, rings and a crust on hot flakey fish. The fish here is the real thing not some unnatural square, a large fillet of mild white fish with a great breading on a simple bun. The condiments are on the table and up to you, tartar sauce, hot sauce, a spicy \"famous\" vinegar and ketchup. It was a big sandwich but not titanic maybe just queen marry.\n\nBottom line if you want some fried food and have cash give this a try.","A group of friends came here after the Pittsburgh Marathon and must say had a great time. They opened early in order to accomodate the runners and their appetites. (first +)\n\nThe drinks were priced far below that of the neighboring competition. (Second +)\n\nI'm a vegetarian, so most of the menu was off limits for me, but since it was my first visit here i had to try something. Ended up ordering the onion rings and fries - Best i've ever had. (third +)\n\nThe service was amazing. Mary, the kitchen manager, was beyond wonderful. Kept the food being delivered to the tables, kept the drinks filled, and smiled about it the whole time. The other servers (apologize for not knowing their names) were awesome as well. They treated everyone in our group and others around us wonderfully. (fourth +)\n\nMary has been there for 35 of the restaurant's 144 years, and loves every moment of it. i will definitely be going back to this place for the fun atmosphere.","Being in town for business my co-worker and I decided on another trip to this eatery. It didn't disappoint us last year and this year was the same.\n     It's not fancy, we sat at the bar.\n     I had the Clam Strips with Onion Rings and a Bowl of Clam Chowder. My friend had the Fried Shrimp, Onion Rings and Chowder. The chowder was as good as last year. Rich, flavorful with tender clams and soft potatoes. My clams and my friends shrimp were both perfect. Downed with a Stella and you can't go wrong.\n     We watch them bring out their next to largest fish sandwich and it was huge. well worth the money. I'll be having it next year with the Chowder.\n     Don't miss it if you love Clam Chowder.","I am obsessed with the fried fish sandwiches! They are not greasy or overly breaded so you get a really nice piece of fish on a soft bun. The provolone sticks are another one of my favorites on the menu. Fried fish sandwiches are my all time favorite thing to eat so I've tried a lot, but nothing comes close to this place.","Outside of maybe Primanti Bros. You really don't get much more Pittsburgh than the Oiriginal Oyster House. The prices are cheap, the food is very good as it the service.","Best fish sandwich in Pittsburgh.  Yummy oysters too! Always a great meal here.  Always sit at the bar. Even when I was a kid and my Dad took me there,  we always sat at the bar.  Great bartenders.  Awesome ambience,  old school, great place.","I've lived in Allegheny County my whole life, but only went to the Original Oyster House for the first time today. I'd heard they were reputed to have the best fish sandwich in the city, so that's what I was looking for. \n\n(By the way, as a side-note to the people, on Yelp and elsewhere, who whine about how a restaurant with the word \"Oyster\" in its name should focus on gourmet oysters and not fish sandwiches: Jesus, grow up. I don't go to Red Robin because I'm in the mood for some robin carpaccio, and I don't go to the Silk Elephant because I'm in the mood for some broiled pachyderms. A name is just a name. This is a very old establishment, and if you didn't do your homework going in to know what's good to order nowadays, then the fault is wholly yours, and I have zero sympathy. To quote a wise Russian: CRY SOME MORE.)\n\nAnyway, back to the sandwich:\n\nI got a platter with fries, slaw, and the sandwich. Sounds very pedestrian, sure, but it was far from ordinary. The slaw was very substantial and was dressed well without being overwhelming. The fries were extremely fresh, had a lot of substance to them, and were satisfyingly crispy. The fish sandwich itself- heck, I can hardly write about it, because I couldn't help but to inhale it. It was the best fish sandwich I can recall ever having eaten, and I could hardly stop myself from wolfing it down, bite after intoxicating bite. It's something you really just need to experience for yourself.\n\nI ate at the bar, and your usual condiments (ketchup, tartar sauce, salt, pepper, etc) were easily at hand. I used a moderate dollop of tartar sauce on my sandwich, which was great, but I'm sure the sandwich would have stood up fine without it, too. A lot of places' fish sandwiches are extremely bland and dry, making the tartar sauce necessary just to swallow it down, but the OOH's sandwich needs no such crutch. The tartar sauce is able to do what it's really meant to do: complement an already-excellent fish dish\n\nSo, what else can I say? I feel like my life as a Pittsburgher is enriched just knowing that this place exists, and I can't believe I've been missing out as long as I have been. I'm a graduate student at Pitt, and I can guarantee that whenever I have a solid hour free for lunch, I'll hop a bus downtown to get another fish sandwich platter. After today, I can't imagine a better Pittsburgh lunch- not even Primanti's."],"type":["Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low

waiter was to be found about ten minutes later they gave us our water and left again! It wasn't even busy! There were only TWO dim sum carts floating around somewhere. Then our waiter finally came around and took our orders of lunch entrees. The food was not even that good as the reviews that are posted on here. When we came up to pay, the bill was super overpriced. I will not be returning here, I am better off eating at Great Wall Cuisine.","If this place had zero stars I would have given them that ! Let me start off by saying I was so excited to read all great reviews so maybe I just came in on a off day? We walked in and were seated came over and asked if we wanted water or tea I guess they don't serve anything Else, Then we placed an order pork dumplings and sticky rice nasty! Then I asked if they served egg rolls they said they were out!!! they pushed their little carts around with hot plates that basically steam the food and is not fresh and what you get is soggy poor customer service we had to get up and look for someone to give us our tab so we could get the heck out of there are get some real food. It looked like it would be a great place for groups of people would not recommend if you are on mission for what you want and want to place an order but it could be a fun experience for some people.","You walk into a Chinese restaurant on a Saturday afternoon for dim sum and you expect the place to be PACKED.  Well, walking in to a pretty much empty dining room, it's a VERY CLEAR SIGN.  But my friend insisted and I was very hesitant for good reasons.  Another indicator, the majority of the patrons were NON Asian.  \n\nFood: You walk in and you see carts of the food by the entrance to the dining room.  Umm, I thought dim sum should come right off the steamer and into the carts and they roll it around, not sitting around.  The dim sum was garbage.  It had the typical selection, but at minimum.  \n\nService: It's ok.  But it doesn't make up for the horrible food.\n\nBottom line: NO WAY!  Stay away!","I've been here many times...Mother's Day with family, dim sum with book club, etc. But I will not go back again.  I stopped in to ask the owner about a donation or reduced price for a class of under-privileged kids that I volunteer with.  His reaction was to scoff and shoo me out the door while handing me his card and saying I could email him.  He turned his back and headed off to the messy newspaper-strewn table he haunts between guests arrivals.  Maybe he's a community-minded business owner, but then again, maybe he's not.  I'll be dining elsewhere.","Being from Chicago, we are used to getting authentic Chinese food all the time.  But when we first starting spending a lot of time in Scottsdale/Phoenix, we found it a challenge to get authentic Chinese food.  We were excited to find the Golden Buddha and have made many trips over the years all the way from the Troon North area to get our fix.  However, service has declined to the point where it is no longer worth the aggravation.  We went there last night for Chinese New Year and will never go back.  Granted they were very busy because of a lot of large tables there, but waiting almost an hour to get our food is not acceptable under any circumstance!  45 mins. into our wait, the waitress came back (after we flagged her down to ask about our food) and said one of the dishes we ordered was not available....after 45 mins.!!!! What makes the whole experience an unforgivable one is that the manager/owner is so indifferent and never apologized or offered a discount off the bill...nothing.  When we left, the same manager was at the piano singing in Chinese. Huh?  Other than Nee House in Scottsdale, the search goes on for a restaurant that serves authentic Chinese food closer to home.","I will NEVER go there again.  I reserved a table for a group of 16 people for 5:00 PM on Christmas Eve .  The person on the phone ( I believe the manager) repeatedly asked me to call ahead and give him an accurate head count since he said they'd be swamped that day.  I followed up with him twice.  \nWhen the first couple of us arrived, we had menus shoved in our faces immediately and told we \"Must order now.  Must order now\" because they were going to be busy later on.  The place was practically empty.  As each person arrived, they were treated the same way. \nWe rushed and placed our orders and then they brought out our checks WAY before we saw any sign of our food.  I have never in my life been treated so rudely by a restaurant.\nIt was utter chaos when the food started coming out while everyone struggled to get the correct dish they ordered.  One person didn't get her food until we were all just about finished eating. \nOne top of all that, the food wasn't even good.  I've had better Kung Pao Chicken at Panda Express!\nAfter being rushed through our meal, the place wasn't even half full by the time we left.  I thought being at the Cultural Center, this restaurant would be a sure thing but boy was I wrong.  Lovely way to spend Christmas Eve..","If you are looking a chinese restaurant to host a big party look some other than the Golden Buddah.  I recently attended a banquet at the Golden Buddah and I was shocked at the level of quality of food and service.  Of the 10 dishes served 4 were nearly inedible.  \n\nThere was a crab claw appetizer, most chinese restaurants prepare this dish by taking a crab claw surrounding it with ground shrimp, batter and then deep fry.  At Golden Buddah, the crab claw served was mostly batter.  \n\nThe shark fin soup served was mostly broth.  Shark fin is an expensive ingredient and most places usually use imitation shark fin, but come on at least put something in there so that I know I'm eating soup and not dirty sink water.  \n\nGinger scallion lobster is battered, fried, and then stir fried in a sauce with ginger and scallions.  The ginger scallion lobster served was over-cooked and dried out.  \n\nLastly, there was a steamed fish.  The fish was raw in the middle.   \n\nIt wasn't all bad, there was a crispy chicken with garlic dish that was pretty good, but out of 10 dishes 4 were bad, 5 were okay, and 1 was good.  \n\nDoes 4 bad dishes out of 10 warrant a one star rating?  Well it does when you factor in the service.  The soup, appetizer, and first entree arrived timely, but after that there was a 1 hour gap before we received the next dish.  The dishes were not served with accompanying white rice which I thought was odd.  We had to ask for it, and even the rice took a while to arrive.","I agree with Crystal C., that the dim sum isn't the greatest I've ever had. In fact, I am not sure if the meal was so tasty that it was memorable. I do remember the \"calamari\" was not really calamari, like you would think. It was presented more like a sweet and sour pork (so calamari with LOTS of breading) without any sauce. As a result, the dish was dry and salty.\n\nThe sticky rice was good (hard to mess up), the chicken feet were okay (needed more five spice powder), and the shumai was alright. The noodles were good, and I can see why the cart ran out after the first round. The diners were an equal mix of Asians and Americans. I would've preferred to see more Asians eating (as I am used to in a Chinatown and gives an indication of authenticity), but I do realize we're in Phoenix where the Asian population is not like San Francisco or Houston. \n\nThe meal came to about $30 for two, including jasmine tea. The carts are loud because they are made out of metal and roll on tile. I am also not used to staff members shouting what they have in their cart, like a newspaper boy yelling \"Extra! Extra!\" Christmas music was playing after mid-January, so the atmosphere felt strange. Next time I visit the city, I probably will pass.","Can't say that I was very impressed. Came for dinner in a hopeful and enthusiastic mood since the reviews have been pretty good, but I don't think this place lives up to its current good, but declining rating.\n\nOrdered the Combo fried rice (shrimp, chicken, beef, pork), sesame chicken, and garlic fried chicken. \n\nThe combo fried rice was pretty good, but ended up drinking about 6 glasses of water due to the MSG and sodium content. You'd think that the cook spent his better years in the French Foreign Legion in the Sahara eating salt tablets and developed a taste for them. \n\nThe sesame chicken had a good flavor and a thick brown sweet sauce. I liked it a lot until it got cool and the sauce looked (with that stringy consistency) more like glue. You think I'm kidding? I'm not.\n\nGarlic fried chicken was bad. Just bad. It was like an over roasted dried out half chicken with some dried garlic pieces sprinkled on top. No spices, no flavor, no good. \n\nWe then got all kinds of lip from the waitress when we asked if they could change the channel on the TV from college football, to the Suns game. They made it into this big deal that the \"customers\" wanted to see the football game. Yeah right, it was University of West Virginia Vs. University of Connecticut! I would have believed it if it was a local team....\n\nIt's better than a 1 star joint, but only because it's borderline edible. To be avoided.","This restaurant is located in the Chinese Cultural Center and was the one restaurant that I had not been to. So after some shopping at one of the shops, we stepped in to have dinner.\n\nWe stepped in and asked for a seat for two. We were seated immediately. The place was decorated nicely and a lady playing the piano made for great ambiance.\n\nWe looked at the menu briefly and ordered our drinks, an appetizer, a soup and two main dishes. The drinks came out promptly and so did the rest of the meal. My goodness everything we ordered was very tasty.\n\nThe waiter service itself however was not even close to the decor and food. He never introduced himself, and although he took our order, our food itself was brought out by a kitchen person.\n\nAfter we ordered our waiter really never came back asking if we needed anything else, except to give us our check at the end and that was after the person I was dining with got up and asked a different waiter for it.\n\nIt's amazing how a place with great food, decor, and ambiance can mess it all up by crappy waiter service.","I love Dim Sum, my favorite Chinese dish.\n\nWhen Golden Buddha first open, they have excellent Dim sum. I went there many times, I tell my friend how good it is, But now,  they change cook, taste more like  week old left over. Rumor has it, they change cook every few month, so Quality of cooking change. (not sure if that is true, but that is what I was told.)\nMy advice is; when you walk in the door and the place is pack, = Good Cook. if the place is bare = bad cook. leave immediately. don't waste your money.","If you just \"want\" dim sum, go here. If you are \"craving\" dim sum, go elsewhere (take a 5 hour drive west to neighboring state, California).\n\nAnyway, I've been visiting Golden Buddha in the noontime for roughly 2 years now. I believe they moved from their original site (7th St. & Osborn), formerly \"China Doll.\" Relocation brought along better atmosphere and smiling faces. This does not mean, better dim sum. But since we are in Phoenix, I will settle for what they have to offer. \n\nBe mindful of the dim sum tab. It's itemized high-medium-low. \n\nShaomai can be found as combinations of pork/mushroom, shrimp, or shark fin (which should not be confused as true shark bits, as the shaomai is prepared to look like a shark's fin). These picks are okay...perhaps on a better day shao mai will be served in less-rigid, or fresher wrappers. Potstickers are okay as well, just the usual scallion and pork, and dry wrapper. The baby pork ribs in light black bean sauce and jalapenos is alright, but sometimes lacks in taste. Tripe is also served in its bare minimum...so if you enjoy the texture and flavor of tripe, try this with its clear sauce and thinly sliced carrots and celery.  \nBuche (that's what I call it), or fried sesame balls are also available, although if you wait until dessert, they will also be a bit stiff. There are a few other things that may be \"spotted\" but are not worth mentioning. \n\nDon't order from their lunch menu, as you can find these over-salted dishes at Panda Express anyway. \n\nOverall, dim sum at Golden Buddha is a place to go if you are around the vicinity and feel like having something apart from the usual fast food. However, discriminating palates- beware.","Not impressed with this place at all. This was not the friendliest place around, maybe because of the language barrier (most or all were clearly native Chinese speakers), or maybe just the attitude of the employees.\n\nI ordered the sweet and sour chicken lunch, which came with the typical egg drop soup, crab rangoon, and egg roll. The soup was ok - maybe it's just me, but I prefer a real spoon to the scoop that they gave me. The egg roll was tiny and not that great, and the crab rangoon was ok, but maybe a little undercooked. The chicken wasn't bad, but nothing special, as was the rice and other stuff on the plate.\n\nOverall, this was just not my kind of Chinese place.","Disappointing.  Mediocre at best.  I am staying at the Aloft hotel in phoenix and ordered some delivery. I ordered a couple american chinese food staples: general tso's chicken, dumplings and hot&sour soup.  Soup had zero flavor, dumplings tasted freezer burned and processed.  General tso chicken was ehh. \n\nA lot of good reviews on here so it must be for eat in and for their dim sum.  Don't order delivery, you will be left hungry and unsatisfied.","Went there on Saturday for early lunch.  My wife did the dim sum, it was okay, we were both disgusted by the sugar cane shrimp; but the rest was good.  \n\nI ordered the chicken szechwuan, the waitress warned me it was \"spicy\" the reason I ordered it.  It came out delicious, but not what I would call spicy.  Overall its hard to find good Chinese in the valley and I would call this good without hesitation.","So I was referred to this place from the front desk of my hotel. I'm from SF so I'm coming from a place with really good chinese food. \n\nThe dim sum is just \"ok\" nothing for me to write home about. The one dish that I really liked was the chinese broccoli cooked with garlic sauce. Yum yum yum.  It's in a big bowl, not oily, not saucy, just really good. I think it's $7.50.  \n\nIt's a somewhat pricey and just like all chinese restaurants, it's not the cleanest.  The chair was filthy.  the dishes weren't all that great.  I wouldn't go back unless I want the chinese broccoli.  \n\nSo I went on a Sunday and it was not crowded at all. There's not a huge asian population  in Phoenix (not that I could tell) so I don't think there's a high demand for dim sum.  And also, I sooooooo felt like taking a pic of this, but a Mexican lady was pushing one of the dim sum carts. That is unheard of in SF.  This is a mainly mandarin restaurant and the dim sum places I go are usually cantonese.  Not a big deal though since the dishes look the same. \n\nDude, there was a turtle in the fish tank that I saw as I left.  I hope they don't eat that!","A Premier Chinese Atmosphere,\nThe Chinese cultural center and Asian Garden produces an Asain atmosphere that can be recognized from the 202.  \n With Dim Sum served this location earns its respect from the local community.\n\nDim Sum tip,  You have to be smart with the Dim Sum ladies they look nice innocent but they are professional sales people that will sell you more dishes than you need before you know what to do.  \n\nI love the desserts here ask the server to see the dessert tray.","This restaurant has a bit of an identity crisis. It is in the Chinese cultural center, but serves Japanese beer (Kirin on tap!) and the live piano music is American pop. We had to ask for chopsticks.\n\nHaving said that, the service was professional. Our waiter held a hot appetizer for one of our party who was away from the table so that it would not be cold when he returned. We were asked frequently--and not too frequently--if things were ok both by our waiter and the manager/proprietor.\n\nThe food was ok-to-good. Fried shrimp egg rolls were dainty but yummy. Duck was tasty but very chewy. Kung-pao chicken was pleasantly spiced. Plenty of rice. A pitcher of ice water with lemon was left at the table. \n\nAtmosphere was also pleasant. Chairs comfortable, tables spaced well, restrooms large and clean...and there is indeed a large golden Buddha by the entrance.","I took a group of friends here and relatives other times. The place is consistently good for Dim-sum during lunch. It is typical Chinese and nothing fancy.\n\nWhat helps this place is the moat scenery.  3 stars for visiting here based on convenience since there are similar places in town.","Having grown up in Hong Kong and having eaten dim sum in London, NY, LA, SF and Vancouver (actually Richmond), I can confidently say I know my dim sum.\n\nGood selection of well-executed dim sum when the carts actually come around and there's anything left in it.  I'd give it 4 stars for food but the wait definitely detracted from the whole experience.\n\nI think the problem with Golden Buddha is that they can't handle the heavy flow on weekends.  There's not enough regular dim sum eaters like LA that can sustain a steady flow of diners throughout the week, forcing restaurants like Golden Buddha to depend heavily on extra part-time help on weekends.  \n\nDim sum takes serious skill so the chef still ends up doing most of the work.  When we looked into the kitchen, we saw a Chinese woman doing most of the cooking herself.  No wonder it took forever for a cart to come out and when it does, it's swarmed on by a pack of vultures.\n\nIf you're willing to eat at a more simply decorated place with a smaller menu, I'd highly recommend China Chan.  It's much more relaxed - usually no wait on weekends.  An experienced chef makes all the dim sum himself so the menu's much shorter but all the classics are on it.  Anything steamed is made to order so is very fresh.","Situated in the Chinese Cultural Center near the SkyHarbor Airport, this was another pleasant find. All I had was the Dim Sum menu, and I would say this is the best you're gonna get in Phoenix. Still worth the stop to get your Dim Sum fix. The cart ladies were pleasant and very happy to converse with me in Cantonese. Only downside was the chicken sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaves, naw mei gai, was way overcooked, and mushy.","Do you want to eat Chinese Food in an elegant environment on a Friday night in Phoenix? \n\nBe entertained by classic, quiet standards being played live on a piano while you dine?\n\nAre you 50 years old and Caucasian?\n\nThen the Golden Buddha is the place for you! \n\nIts in the Chinese Cultural Center Mall on 44th, and a popular weekend spot for Dim Sum. For a DIm Sum starved Valley of the Sun, Golden Buddha's is decent. \n\nFor dinner, though, it is awfully Americanized and not very authentic Chinese. But with a bunch of American customers coming for dinner, what do you expect? They probably think they are getting \"real Chinese\" food by going to the Chinese Mall, but then again, they are used to PF Chang's or Stix normally in their neighborhood, so this is a step up.\n\nThe best thing about this place is the decor, which is clean and nice, with a Hong Kong Junk boat design covering the ceiling from the bar into the dining room. The next best thing is the Piano interludes on weekend nights. The service is next, which is a little overly eager to remove your plate, and the last thing is the food. \n\nThey do give decent portions. I ordered Guo Teh (potstickers) and got 6 fat ones. But they weren't served with the usual soy, chili oil and vinegar, but a soy and green onions mixture. The Mapo Tofu was ok, as they used a nice silky tofu, which was nice, but no green onions, and sliced black mushrooms instead, which I like, but not in this dish.\n\nCome here for the ambiance and music in the evenings, or on the weekend days for Dim Sum.","Decent dim sum, especially to be found in the middle of the desert. Sadly, the best food I've had in Phoenix.","This place is a little difficult for me to review.  I was staying at the Hampton Inn across the street and this is the closest restaurant so off I went.\n\nI walked in and the owner or manager met me at the door and asked \"how many\"?\n\nI told him I wanted to order take out and handed me a menu and pointed to the waiting area which was covered in newspapers.  I chose to go to the bar, order a glass of wine, and peruse the menu.\n\nThe drinks are expensive but I didn't think the food was.  Less than $10 for my Mongolian Chicken which came with white sticky rice and a fortune cookie.  When ordering I asked if I could have fried rice instead of white rice but was told \"no\".  Most places allow this for a nominal fee.\n\nFine by me.  Give the white rice.  Food was prepared and their to-go boxes were a lot better than the standard white Chinese \"to go\" boxes.  They also included the plastic-ware, napkin, and soy sauce, which a lot of places forget.\n\nLooking around I found a whole lot of goodness along with a couple disappointments.  Most notably the newspaper strewn about and behind the bar, to the right were a lot of boxes stacked in an unsightly fashion.  I could have been a little more presentable in my opinion.\n\nI peeked into the dining room because I wanted to see if the piano music was piped in or live.  It was live which was very nice. Also, the dinning room looked very nice and cozy.\n\nAs I was leaving the same man who greeted me upon entering made sure to wish me a good evening.  My initial impression of the man was that he was surly and testy but that's just how he comes off.\n\nThe food was very good.  The Mongolian sauce was mixture of sweet with spice and the chicken and vegetables all tasted fresh.","My husband and I went there Saturday, the service was great!  Our friends were going to be late so they told us to start.  And start we did!\nThey were serving Dim Sum, something we had never tried, so glad we did, it was wonderful, hubby wouldn't do the chicken feet, but I think next time I will, it looked very good.\nOur friends showed up and ordered their food, and ate all of it, they said that usually they take food home, but it was so good they had to eat all of it!\nWe will be going back very soon!","Let's see, over 50... check \nold white man...........check \neats dinner ...............check \nlistens to the piano  check \n\nwow this must be the place for me, I mean after all it is in a Chinese mall, no make that a Chinese Cultural Center. How could I possibly have discerning taste with such trickery to get me here to eat. \nDude if you are going to rate a restaurant no need to degrade others with your arrogance. \nFool is my review of wanugee N. \n\nNow on the restaurant. The last time we were here the food was not good, the piano was too loud and the waitress had a real attitude. IT won't keep me from going back as I have had good meals and wait service too. \n\nBack to wanugee N. I do not expect any place in Phx. to have authentic Chinese food, by that I mean the street food one finds in China. \nBut I do expect what I fork in to my mouth is worth what I am going to fork over in cost. Even an old white guy like me can tell the difference between good and bad food. No matter what it is called.","Okay so Ive been glum the past few days as I have an impending birthday. Every year this time I get all down in the dumps.. not that I'm not happy with my life cause life is good. Its more like getting further away from my youth and closer to being well, old. All of my grandparents were crotchety, sourpuss drama queens.. is that my fate? Can I break the mold or am I to going to be a crotchety sourpuss?\n\nSo as I contemplate and figure out what I'm going to do with my birthday baggage I decide to squash it with food. All weekend Ive been eating out and having a good time. This is one of the few times outside of a vacation where I will live it completely and to the near of sheer gluttony. So why not dim sum? \n\nIve chowed much dim sum in my 36 years of earthen wear.. of course some good and some bad. I have never been to a place where every dish was great.. Golden Buddha is no exception to this.. they do the basics well enough and have enough funky cool Asian style to keep me interested in returning. The carts around 1130 flow well but around noon it' s full blown freeway action! In fact there might be some road kill in there based on some of the looks on that last steam cart.. \n\nMe and 3 others who were feeling my pain ordered 14, count them, 14 different dishes. One of my friends is from Georgia and had never had dim sum but he is so courageous and unflinching that he was just a blast. Just the shot in the arm to get me out of my funk. I remember the first time I had dim sum.. my eyes wide open, nostrils flared and excited to see what was under the next steamer lid. That was him today.. one exciting thing after the next.. he was even willing to try chicken feet but this is one of those dishes not done very well here. \n\nMy friend took me back to a time where I was younger and less experienced. He looked up to me to guide him through the noodles, bao and sui mai.. like a big brother.. I'm privileged that I could show him something new and exciting and he was so into it! So instead of feeling sorry for myself I felt experienced and useful.. that there is something I can give back to others.. that its not all about me and me aging but about what can be shared with others.\n\nThere is so much more to do, give and feel in this short time we are here.. and Ill do it to, one bite at a time.","The best to be found in land locked Arizona.  My favorite sticky rice is here.  They have dim sum every day, but not a huge selection, though you can order off the menu.  I think it is much bigger on the weekends.  I'm just happy I can get my fix 7 days a week.  Beautiful gardens to walk through, with fish ponds, and a 99 market next door!","I ate at Golden Buddha a few weeks ago.  We ate at the restaurant after a day at the zoo with our 4 year old and had a blast.  The piano bar played tunes for my daughter and the staff was more than accommodating.  The general tso chicken was better than anything I can get in Tucson.  The soup was chocked full of fresh, read FRESH, not canned, vegetables.  All in all, I was very satisfied with the meal and the service.  Plus the decor is very nice, clean and cheery. \n\nEat at Golden Buddha.","For those who gave this place low marks, forgive me. I really like this place. Now I haven't tried various dim sum places so I'm reserving the right to downgrade the place as needed. The variety of food is plentiful, and the carts just keep on coming. I love the steamed pork buns, and the shiu mai (not sure if I spelled that correctly). Yesterday, my favorite pick was the deep fried rolls of taro and shrimp. YUM! I have never ordered from their menu so I can only talk about their dim sum. My friends and I try to go eat dim sum almost every Sunday. It's a cheap way to try new foods, and if you don't like it, well.. you can get away with pushing it aside with minimal guilt. Give it a try! You might be surprised.","I like Golden Buddha, have taken many friends there for Dim Sum.  \nTry not to \"hit\" the dumpling cart to heavy; otherwise cannot finish it to the dessert cart (LOL).\nLove the jasmine tea and the staff willing to help you if you do not understand the what each item is.\nSingapore Rice Noodles a favorite, along with any of the shrimp dumplings; also the broccoli and green beans.\nOnly wish that the carts with eggplant stuffed with shrimp or green peppers with shrimp were not on \"heated\" carts; by the time it gets to you the food is cold.\nOnly concern is that went on 22MAY2010 at 1:30PM; there was a closed sign due to electricity???\nREVISED: 26MAY2010 - called this evening - looks like they are back open again.","I've been to the Golden Buddha on several occasions and it is my favorite, by far, for honest Chinese food. \nWhile I've sampled everything from their vegetarian to their beef, I love their mandarin chicken. More recently, I was delighted to relive the wonders of their Kung Pao Chicken and Beef with Broccoli. \nI absolutely love the egg drop soup and mini crab rangoons that come with the meal.","The very first time I went to Golden Buddha was with my BFF and it was our first dim sum experience. Little did I know this would forever change my life and eating experiences. Although I must admit that first time was a bit awkward.\n\nGB wisely takes reservations which was wonderful (even though it wasn't crazy busy). Our assorted dim sum plates were flavorful and fresh. And the carts seemed to be in constant rotation so we were never too far from a good selection.\n\nWhat really helps GB is its location. The Cofco Center is an experience in itself, where one can have herbs specially blended, select a fresh member of marine life to take home and cook or browse through a store with one of the largest selections of Buddhas and hand fans I've experienced outside of San Francisco.","I've been to Golden Buddha a few times and have not been disappointed. \n\nThey have a LARGE selection of Dim Sum and if you're not careful you can get carried away.\n\nTry and get there early and you'll get the best and most fresh selection.\nMake sure you walk around the garden when you're done.","Probably the most comprehensive Chinese menu in the Valley.  Pick from well over 100 dishes, but if you want the best order the Peking Duck.  Everything else is very good, but without a wow factor.  You'll see lots of Chinese people in this massive restaurant, which probably means they're doing a fine job in the kitchen.","I very much enjoyed eating here. Food was great. Fairly fast service. Wasn't expensive either for the 4 of us.","Golden Buddha has GREAT dim sum.  Their prices are reasonable and the staff is very polite wheeling their little carts.  I tend to go on the weekend because there is more selection but they do dim sum throughout the week.  They also have some very authentic dishes on the menu for those who are more of the adventurous types.  Be sure to say hello to the turtles the next time you go.","This place in the Chinese Cultural Center has a very pretty and elegant bar area. I was pleased to learn that they had some very reasonable and delicious happy hour snacks. This is a good place for a Pina Colada. I had one by myself along with some dumplings and fried shrimp appetizer. Sadly I never brought anyone else here with me. It was happy hour heaven but you know? A lot of my friends in AZ pretty much hang out in one neighborhood or another and nobody I know really lives close to the Buddha.\nThe airport is pretty close by. This might be a good pre-flight send-off location.","I have had dim sum in New Orleans and Phoenix (not SF), and this is about equal to the best of New Orleans as far as flavor.\nAs for ambiance, today was a good day. I've had dim sum here about a dozen times, and have had very good service and quality 90% of the time, including weekends. I have had bad days here, but since today was good, I'll rate accordingly. It's closer to a 4.5, but since I can't give half-stars, I rounded up.\nDon't expect me to give these the right names, but... I was less than impressed with the bbq pork balls. They tasted too much like honey and the beef was minimal. The bbq sauce tasted bottled. Outside of that, their herbal hot tea is delicious even on a hot day.\nThe shu mai were very good, and the shrimp in a spinach dumpling was fantastic. A definite don't miss is their sticky rice in lotus leaf. It's among the best I've had anywhere. Just be careful; you'll find bones in it every once in a while. Go for any of their steamed dumplings; they're very flavorful. As others have said, I love the Chinese broccoli, but you'll only find it on the carts on weekends. Otherwise order it off the menu.\nToday (11:30 lunch) the carts came around often, and everything except the pork buns was piping hot and fresh. By the way, despite the price increases, even the sticky rice was considered a medium size entree, and the two of us eating there escaped with a bill under $20 and we were done in under 30 minutes.\nI strongly recommend the dim sum here, whether you've had it a million times or have never had it before. You usually won't be disappointed.","I don't really understand the poor reviews on this place.....maybe it depends on the day you go? We went on a Sunday, it was crazy busy, but service was great! (of course, my view of customer service is a little different then the rest... I used to live on an island where you were just happy to find what you were looking for, let alone expect good customer service) Anyways, our server was very sweet! Always had a smile on her face. The carts served us promplty and none of the food was cold. They always had whatever we wanted (I hate having to wait for the next cart).\n\nNow, as for the actual dim sum and food.......holy cow, to die for! So flavorful and fresh!! The broccoli makes you sing...and the wine noodles, make you cry. You leave with very weird mixed emotions, but mostly a happy belly full of yummy food.\n\nIn my opinion, this is the best dim sum I have been able to find in Phx. I'm ditching my previous spot (Mekong Palace) and will be back to Golden Buddha when the dim sum monster strikes again!"],"type":["Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low

I thought that Page's tasted like an average soft-serve ice cream shop. I was also surprised about the lack of flavors that they offered, there was no cookies and cream or sorbets.\n\nI ordered a small Chocolate Chip ice cream with rainbow sprinkles and my boyfriend ordered the Strawberry Shortcake sundae. My Chocolate Chip ice cream tasted identical to Breyer's boxed ice cream from the grocery store. I may have ordered the wrong item but because it is soft-serve ice cream they don't offer samples. My boyfriend had the Strawberry Shortcake sundae which had 3 pieces of cake on the bottom, 2 scoops of vanilla ice cream, strawberry syrup, strawberries (not fresh), almonds and whipped cream. It was huge and they didn't allow him to swap flavors or make any adjustments.\n\nMaybe my expectations of Page's were too high, but when I had heard about this ice cream shop whose line wrapped down the street I knew I had to check this place out. When I went on a Friday night there was no line and the ice cream was sub-par.","If you never drove down East Carson street, you are missing out on PageDM. Not far from the hopping SSide but in a strange looking spot next to a bridge and at a not so fun corner with a little parking lot.\n\nBut the ice cream is to scream for!  Flavored soft serve ice cream, a Yinzburg Sundae,  a vanilla shake with some real vanilla flavoring.\n\nThe Original Root Beer Barrel is still in the window!\n\nDelicious.\n\nCash only.","Page's is one of my favorite places to go for ice cream in Pittsburgh. It is a pretty cheap place to go for the amount of ice cream that they give. I'm a big fan of soft serve ice cream so if you are too then definitely check this place out. Their cookie sundae and yinzer sundae are to die for and can easily be shared among 2 or 3 people. The only thing that I wish they would would do is give out samples of the ice cream flavors and take credit/debit cards. They are known for their ice cream but they also have food (burgers, hot dogs, nachos etc) I personally never tried it. But I'm sure it's good as well!","This is one of many hidden gems here in the Burgh. Check it out, freaky good ice cream, better blizzards than Dairy Queen, shakes that would have Ronald McDonald spinning in his grave if he were dead. \n\nI love Page's dairy mart, and look forward to opening day every spring, then go at least every week on those warm summer nights and have a cone or my favorite, peanut butter chocolate ice cream with butterfingers and reeses peanut butter cups running through it. Then I go run for two hours to burn it off, but it's worth it.\n\nWhy four stars? Bad intersection (Carson and Beck's Run) and parking can be a motherbucket.\n\nYou're still sitting there reading this? GO TO PAGE'S NOW!","Stopped in here after a bit of night time sightseeing of Pittsburgh. My sister and brother-in-law, who are the ones who live in Pitt, had never been here before, so we were all newbies! Huge plus that it's open until 11pm on weekdays. This little place is great. You walk up to the order window, pick from a handful of different soft serve favors and cone choices, and are given your fresh ice cream in no time! I ordered the strawberry soft serve in a waffle cone. HUGE portion, and less than $3! Obviously shocking to me as a native New Yorker, since nothing around here is ever that cheap. My sister had cheesecake soft serve, my other sister had blueberry soft serve, both also in waffle cones. My brother-in-law had key lime soft serve in a pretzel cone! So unique and actually really delicious, having that savory/sweet thing going on. 4 cones of ice cream for less than $12. Fresh, homemade ice cream, with really nice staff. I look forward to my next visit to pittsburgh, so I can enjoy this place again!","I grew up in Baldwin, so as a kid, the family and I would always frequent this place often. The Best ice cream around!!! I have to agree the arctic swirl is the best around!!! I suggest you try the chocolate covered pretzel!!! YUMM-O!!!! Good prices and fantastic people working there!!!","Dude... the Cookie sundae\n\nHidden between the Waterfront and Southside in a pretty random area, it's pretty easy to miss this place. Surrounded by hills and located under a bridge. The only other thing nearby is a car place. But this is Pittsburgh, it seems to me that some of the best things in the city are hidden.\n\nIce cream is soft serve and is your pretty standard good ice cream: creamy, soft, cold, with authentic flavors. It's delicious. But honestly, good ice cream can be found in many places in Pittsburgh.\n\nSo what makes this place stand out from all the other ice cream places in Pittsburgh is the fact that they have delicious sundaes. My favorite is the cookie sundae, which has fresh-out-of-the-oven-melt-in-your-mouth cookies on top of a mountain of ice cream and hot fudge. They use Nancy B's bakery cookies. Yum.\n\nThe menu is HUGE. So no, I haven't tried everything. Also, I've found love in the cookie sundae, so I may just stick to that.\n\nPlace is cash-only.","This place is a little gem! Hidden just down E Carson, past all the shops and busy streets there is a tiny little unassuming building on a large corner lot. I've never been a fan of soft serve or gone out of my way for it, but this place will make you do just that. Not to mention the fresh squeezed lemonade made to order (yes, they squeeze the lemons right into your cup.) Burgers and fries are also made to order, so be prepared for a short wait while you prepare mentally for the heaven you're about to consume. I'm not a fan of their fries (they tasted like they were made in old grease) but wow that cheeseburger. I have a small appetite and can't usually finish most things - so when I ordered my burger and fries I let the bf know he was expected to finish it for me. Little did we know he wouldn't get any of that delicious burger, because the second I took the first bite the rest magically disappeared. \n\nOh! They also have old fashioned dip cones which are one of my favs. \n\nDefinitely recommended.","What can I say? This place is iconic here in the South Hills of Pittsburgh. Rich with history, you can't go wrong on a summer's eve with their treats. I've never tasted their actual food (they keep adding non-dessert items to their menu), but there is something about their plain old soft-serve that does the trick. I think it's just the fact that it's from Page's that makes it so good. They also have great milkshakes, dirt sundaes and countless varieties of snow cone flavors. There may be a line to the street, but it's worth it. Skip Diary Queen and make your way down the street.","Best place in Pittsburgh for soft serve. The line is always long, but they are very efficient & it moves quickly. I love that they incorporate so many local ingredients-Nancy B's cookies & burnt almond torte.","If you ever ride down Carson  and pass this little place. Turn the car around and stop in!. The lines can be ridiculously long but it moves very fast and the ice cream is worth it! Blueberry soft serve alone is worth the trip. I love the pretzel cones. If you really want to indulge, have a Chocolate Chip sundae, you will thank me later! Great find!","Best Softserve in the burgh hands down the cookies are hot! You must try the chocolate chip cookie sundae.","Get a Southside Shake with hot fudge shake and peanut butter sundae on top - absolutely amazing!","The best ice cream in Pittsburgh! I've had so many different sundaes over the years. I recommend asking for vanilla with hot fudge and marshmallow sauce with graham crackers for a S'mores sundae. It is not posted in their window anymore but they will do it! \nWith the traffic from Liberty Tunnel closures rerouting past here, you should TOTALLY make a stop. It'll be the best part of your commute.","A 'burgh favorite for a reason. The Yinzer is locally sourced and delicious. For a little slice of not-so-well-known Pittsburgh history and taste, Page's is the ice cream shop to visit.","I've been coming to Page's since I was a kid and at 25 I still get that \"YAY ICE CREAM!\" feeling when I go here.  Their soft serve ice cream is great and their Hawaiian Ice/Slushes come in several different flavors.  The dips on their ice cream cones are very good and very popular as well.  However, my favorite thing to get their is their Artic Swirls which also come in distinct and fun flavors (I really enjoy the Banana Cream Pie).  Did I mention the great prices and friendly staff?  \n\nThis place has been a staple of the South Hills and it never fails to attract a large crowd of people.  You can't go wrong with Page's!","Bring Cash! Extremely cheap ice cream but it's the very best in this region. We're not wasting our time at Dairy Queen any longer. They are open for most of the year but close  in the winter months.
