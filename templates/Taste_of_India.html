Possibly the worst pizza I have ever eaten.  This wouldn't even qualify as pizza in North Jersey.  I ate half of the plain slice because I was starving....then threw both in the garbage.  \n\nIf this is really the best pizza in Pittsburgh... wow.","I ordered from Pizza Parma out of storm necessity. I ordered a chicken parmigiana \"hoagie\", which was dry and luke warm. The potato bacon soup was like something out of a can, except the chunks of potato were hard and undercooked..all pretty nasty and overly salty.\n\nNever order from them.","Zero stars. Came in 10 mins before close. Female manager on duty asked for $100 in exchange for a pizza. When we refused she said she could not serve us because her employees had been working since 9am..,it is currently 2:00 am... Sounds pretty illegal to me","Average pizza. But with ten guys working - and not much business at the moment - it still took twenty minutes to get a slice of pepperoni. I'll walk across the street next time.","My butthole hasn't been right for days, nor my stomach. \n\nWe ordered in because we all had a long day and were set to have a family movie night.\n\nA pizza and hoagie. \n\nThe hoagie wasn't anything to run and go scream from the rooftops about but the pizza was covered in little ass ruining intestinal demons and this I am nearly sure of.\n\nI had to be talked out of sending pizza Parma a bill for several rolls of toilet paper.\n\nBe weary of the pizza, distrustful actually.\n\nYour butthole will thank me for it!","Hubby and I dropped in after a hellish morning at the Social Security office. Hubby loves pizza so we made a stop.\n\nPizza wan't bad, it was actually pretty decent. But the place was disgusting and the cashier was incredibly rude.","I eat this pizza all the time when downtown, usually when running around at events like First Night or the Gallery Crawls...not the best pizza I have ever had in my life, but it's not bad!  And I haven't ever gotten sick from it.  Just wanted to offer a different opinion.","PIzza Parma's decent tasting mega-big-2ft-long hot sausage hoagie was let down by the piss poor attitude of the staff, the lack of cleanliness of the tables and floor, the out-of-order red door restroom, the bright yellow for no-explicable reason walls. \n\nThe large color-striped 80's retro tables and green chairs have come back in style but this win is purely accidental and achieved only by laziness and lack of renovation.\n\nThat is all.","My fiance & I have lived in downtown Pittsburgh for over a year + now & this place is fabulous. \nMy sweetie LOVES LOVES LOVESSS pizza & we order from here a ton.  We haven't ordered anything here that wasn't super tasty.\nThe shop is small & the decor is super bright which makes you want to get in & out quickly but who the hell eats in there anyways. ... you're grabbing your order & running.","I'm glad I listened to my friend's recommendation and not some of these bad reviews. We're just in town for the night and wanted something delivered to our hotel. They said it would take an hour, which I expected on Super Bowl Sunday right at game time, but it was here in less than half an hour. \n\nThe pizza was delicious! Just the right balance of cheese and a tasty sauce, generous with the toppings, and a nicely crispy crust but not too thin.","This place has great service! My best friend and I got 2 custom orders and the older guy in back came out to the register to take our orders personally.  I assume he's either the cook, owner, or both. We ordered 2 cheeselss pizzas; a lot of places mess this up. Pizza Parma however, makes great cheeseless pizza. Our personal pizzas were nice and toasty, not over nor undercooked, and it was not dried out at all! There was more than enough sauce mmmmmmmmm.","My fiance & I have lived in downtown Pittsburgh for over a year + now & this place is fabulous. \nMy sweetie LOVES LOVES LOVESSS pizza & we order from here a ton.

It wasn't even busy! There were only TWO dim sum carts floating around somewhere. Then our waiter finally came around and took our orders of lunch entrees. The food was not even that good as the reviews that are posted on here. When we came up to pay, the bill was super overpriced. I will not be returning here, I am better off eating at Great Wall Cuisine.","If this place had zero stars I would have given them that ! Let me start off by saying I was so excited to read all great reviews so maybe I just came in on a off day? We walked in and were seated came over and asked if we wanted water or tea I guess they don't serve anything Else, Then we placed an order pork dumplings and sticky rice nasty! Then I asked if they served egg rolls they said they were out!!! they pushed their little carts around with hot plates that basically steam the food and is not fresh and what you get is soggy poor customer service we had to get up and look for someone to give us our tab so we could get the heck out of there are get some real food. It looked like it would be a great place for groups of people would not recommend if you are on mission for what you want and want to place an order but it could be a fun experience for some people.","You walk into a Chinese restaurant on a Saturday afternoon for dim sum and you expect the place to be PACKED.  Well, walking in to a pretty much empty dining room, it's a VERY CLEAR SIGN.  But my friend insisted and I was very hesitant for good reasons.  Another indicator, the majority of the patrons were NON Asian.  \n\nFood: You walk in and you see carts of the food by the entrance to the dining room.  Umm, I thought dim sum should come right off the steamer and into the carts and they roll it around, not sitting around.  The dim sum was garbage.  It had the typical selection, but at minimum.  \n\nService: It's ok.  But it doesn't make up for the horrible food.\n\nBottom line: NO WAY!  Stay away!","I've been here many times...Mother's Day with family, dim sum with book club, etc. But I will not go back again.  I stopped in to ask the owner about a donation or reduced price for a class of under-privileged kids that I volunteer with.  His reaction was to scoff and shoo me out the door while handing me his card and saying I could email him.  He turned his back and headed off to the messy newspaper-strewn table he haunts between guests arrivals.  Maybe he's a community-minded business owner, but then again, maybe he's not.  I'll be dining elsewhere.","Being from Chicago, we are used to getting authentic Chinese food all the time.  But when we first starting spending a lot of time in Scottsdale/Phoenix, we found it a challenge to get authentic Chinese food.  We were excited to find the Golden Buddha and have made many trips over the years all the way from the Troon North area to get our fix.  However, service has declined to the point where it is no longer worth the aggravation.  We went there last night for Chinese New Year and will never go back.  Granted they were very busy because of a lot of large tables there, but waiting almost an hour to get our food is not acceptable under any circumstance!  45 mins. into our wait, the waitress came back (after we flagged her down to ask about our food) and said one of the dishes we ordered was not available....after 45 mins.!!!! What makes the whole experience an unforgivable one is that the manager/owner is so indifferent and never apologized or offered a discount off the bill...nothing.  When we left, the same manager was at the piano singing in Chinese. Huh?  Other than Nee House in Scottsdale, the search goes on for a restaurant that serves authentic Chinese food closer to home.","I will NEVER go there again.  I reserved a table for a group of 16 people for 5:00 PM on Christmas Eve .  The person on the phone ( I believe the manager) repeatedly asked me to call ahead and give him an accurate head count since he said they'd be swamped that day.  I followed up with him twice.  \nWhen the first couple of us arrived, we had menus shoved in our faces immediately and told we \"Must order now.  Must order now\" because they were going to be busy later on.  The place was practically empty.  As each person arrived, they were treated the same way. \nWe rushed and placed our orders and then they brought out our checks WAY before we saw any sign of our food.  I have never in my life been treated so rudely by a restaurant.\nIt was utter chaos when the food started coming out while everyone struggled to get the correct dish they ordered.  One person didn't get her food until we were all just about finished eating. \nOne top of all that, the food wasn't even good.  I've had better Kung Pao Chicken at Panda Express!\nAfter being rushed through our meal, the place wasn't even half full by the time we left.  I thought being at the Cultural Center, this restaurant would be a sure thing but boy was I wrong.  Lovely way to spend Christmas Eve..","If you are looking a chinese restaurant to host a big party look some other than the Golden Buddah.  I recently attended a banquet at the Golden Buddah and I was shocked at the level of quality of food and service.  Of the 10 dishes served 4 were nearly inedible.  \n\nThere was a crab claw appetizer, most chinese restaurants prepare this dish by taking a crab claw surrounding it with ground shrimp, batter and then deep fry.  At Golden Buddah, the crab claw served was mostly batter.  \n\nThe shark fin soup served was mostly broth.  Shark fin is an expensive ingredient and most places usually use imitation shark fin, but come on at least put something in there so that I know I'm eating soup and not dirty sink water.  \n\nGinger scallion lobster is battered, fried, and then stir fried in a sauce with ginger and scallions.  The ginger scallion lobster served was over-cooked and dried out.  \n\nLastly, there was a steamed fish.  The fish was raw in the middle.   \n\nIt wasn't all bad, there was a crispy chicken with garlic dish that was pretty good, but out of 10 dishes 4 were bad, 5 were okay, and 1 was good.  \n\nDoes 4 bad dishes out of 10 warrant a one star rating?  Well it does when you factor in the service.  The soup, appetizer, and first entree arrived timely, but after that there was a 1 hour gap before we received the next dish.  The dishes were not served with accompanying white rice which I thought was odd.  We had to ask for it, and even the rice took a while to arrive.","I agree with Crystal C., that the dim sum isn't the greatest I've ever had. In fact, I am not sure if the meal was so tasty that it was memorable. I do remember the \"calamari\" was not really calamari, like you would think. It was presented more like a sweet and sour pork (so calamari with LOTS of breading) without any sauce. As a result, the dish was dry and salty.\n\nThe sticky rice was good (hard to mess up), the chicken feet were okay (needed more five spice powder), and the shumai was alright. The noodles were good, and I can see why the cart ran out after the first round. The diners were an equal mix of Asians and Americans. I would've preferred to see more Asians eating (as I am used to in a Chinatown and gives an indication of authenticity), but I do realize we're in Phoenix where the Asian population is not like San Francisco or Houston. \n\nThe meal came to about $30 for two, including jasmine tea. The carts are loud because they are made out of metal and roll on tile. I am also not used to staff members shouting what they have in their cart, like a newspaper boy yelling \"Extra! Extra!\" Christmas music was playing after mid-January, so the atmosphere felt strange. Next time I visit the city, I probably will pass.","Can't say that I was very impressed. Came for dinner in a hopeful and enthusiastic mood since the reviews have been pretty good, but I don't think this place lives up to its current good, but declining rating.\n\nOrdered the Combo fried rice (shrimp, chicken, beef, pork), sesame chicken, and garlic fried chicken. \n\nThe combo fried rice was pretty good, but ended up drinking about 6 glasses of water due to the MSG and sodium content. You'd think that the cook spent his better years in the French Foreign Legion in the Sahara eating salt tablets and developed a taste for them. \n\nThe sesame chicken had a good flavor and a thick brown sweet sauce. I liked it a lot until it got cool and the sauce looked (with that stringy consistency) more like glue. You think I'm kidding? I'm not.\n\nGarlic fried chicken was bad. Just bad. It was like an over roasted dried out half chicken with some dried garlic pieces sprinkled on top. No spices, no flavor, no good. \n\nWe then got all kinds of lip from the waitress when we asked if they could change the channel on the TV from college football, to the Suns game. They made it into this big deal that the \"customers\" wanted to see the football game. Yeah right, it was University of West Virginia Vs. University of Connecticut! I would have believed it if it was a local team....\n\nIt's better than a 1 star joint, but only because it's borderline edible. To be avoided.","This restaurant is located in the Chinese Cultural Center and was the one restaurant that I had not been to. So after some shopping at one of the shops, we stepped in to have dinner.\n\nWe stepped in and asked for a seat for two. We were seated immediately. The place was decorated nicely and a lady playing the piano made for great ambiance.\n\nWe looked at the menu briefly and ordered our drinks, an appetizer, a soup and two main dishes. The drinks came out promptly and so did the rest of the meal. My goodness everything we ordered was very tasty.\n\nThe waiter service itself however was not even close to the decor and food. He never introduced himself, and although he took our order, our food itself was brought out by a kitchen person.\n\nAfter we ordered our waiter really never came back asking if we needed anything else, except to give us our check at the end and that was after the person I was dining with got up and asked a different waiter for it.\n\nIt's amazing how a place with great food, decor, and ambiance can mess it all up by crappy waiter service.","I love Dim Sum, my favorite Chinese dish.\n\nWhen Golden Buddha first open, they have excellent Dim sum. I went there many times, I tell my friend how good it is, But now,  they change cook, taste more like  week old left over. Rumor has it, they change cook every few month, so Quality of cooking change. (not sure if that is true, but that is what I was told.)\nMy advice is; when you walk in the door and the place is pack, = Good Cook. if the place is bare = bad cook. leave immediately. don't waste your money.","If you just \"want\" dim sum, go here. If you are \"craving\" dim sum, go elsewhere (take a 5 hour drive west to neighboring state, California).\n\nAnyway, I've been visiting Golden Buddha in the noontime for roughly 2 years now. I believe they moved from their original site (7th St. & Osborn), formerly \"China Doll.\" Relocation brought along better atmosphere and smiling faces. This does not mean, better dim sum. But since we are in Phoenix, I will settle for what they have to offer. \n\nBe mindful of the dim sum tab. It's itemized high-medium-low. \n\nShaomai can be found as combinations of pork/mushroom, shrimp, or shark fin (which should not be confused as true shark bits, as the shaomai is prepared to look like a shark's fin). These picks are okay...perhaps on a better day shao mai will be served in less-rigid, or fresher wrappers. Potstickers are okay as well, just the usual scallion and pork, and dry wrapper. The baby pork ribs in light black bean sauce and jalapenos is alright, but sometimes lacks in taste. Tripe is also served in its bare minimum...so if you enjoy the texture and flavor of tripe, try this with its clear sauce and thinly sliced carrots and celery.  \nBuche (that's what I call it), or fried sesame balls are also available, although if you wait until dessert, they will also be a bit stiff. There are a few other things that may be \"spotted\" but are not worth mentioning. \n\nDon't order from their lunch menu, as you can find these over-salted dishes at Panda Express anyway. \n\nOverall, dim sum at Golden Buddha is a place to go if you are around the vicinity and feel like having something apart from the usual fast food. However, discriminating palates- beware.","Not impressed with this place at all. This was not the friendliest place around, maybe because of the language barrier (most or all were clearly native Chinese speakers), or maybe just the attitude of the employees.\n\nI ordered the sweet and sour chicken lunch, which came with the typical egg drop soup, crab rangoon, and egg roll. The soup was ok - maybe it's just me, but I prefer a real spoon to the scoop that they gave me. The egg roll was tiny and not that great, and the crab rangoon was ok, but maybe a little undercooked. The chicken wasn't bad, but nothing special, as was the rice and other stuff on the plate.\n\nOverall, this was just not my kind of Chinese place.","Disappointing.  Mediocre at best.  I am staying at the Aloft hotel in phoenix and ordered some delivery. I ordered a couple american chinese food staples: general tso's chicken, dumplings and hot&sour soup.  Soup had zero flavor, dumplings tasted freezer burned and processed.  General tso chicken was ehh. \n\nA lot of good reviews on here so it must be for eat in and for their dim sum.  Don't order delivery, you will be left hungry and unsatisfied.","Went there on Saturday for early lunch.  My wife did the dim sum, it was okay, we were both disgusted by the sugar cane shrimp; but the rest was good.  \n\nI ordered the chicken szechwuan, the waitress warned me it was \"spicy\" the reason I ordered it.  It came out delicious, but not what I would call spicy.  Overall its hard to find good Chinese in the valley and I would call this good without hesitation.","So I was referred to this place from the front desk of my hotel. I'm from SF so I'm coming from a place with really good chinese food. \n\nThe dim sum is just \"ok\" nothing for me to write home about. The one dish that I really liked was the chinese broccoli cooked with garlic sauce. Yum yum yum.  It's in a big bowl, not oily, not saucy, just really good. I think it's $7.50.  \n\nIt's a somewhat pricey and just like all chinese restaurants, it's not the cleanest.  The chair was filthy.  the dishes weren't all that great.  I wouldn't go back unless I want the chinese broccoli.  \n\nSo I went on a Sunday and it was not crowded at all. There's not a huge asian population  in Phoenix (not that I could tell) so I don't think there's a high demand for dim sum.  And also, I sooooooo felt like taking a pic of this, but a Mexican lady was pushing one of the dim sum carts. That is unheard of in SF.  This is a mainly mandarin restaurant and the dim sum places I go are usually cantonese.  Not a big deal though since the dishes look the same. \n\nDude, there was a turtle in the fish tank that I saw as I left.  I hope they don't eat that!","A Premier Chinese Atmosphere,\nThe Chinese cultural center and Asian Garden produces an Asain atmosphere that can be recognized from the 202.  \n With Dim Sum served this location earns its respect from the local community.\n\nDim Sum tip,  You have to be smart with the Dim Sum ladies they look nice innocent but they are professional sales people that will sell you more dishes than you need before you know what to do.  \n\nI love the desserts here ask the server to see the dessert tray.","This restaurant has a bit of an identity crisis. It is in the Chinese cultural center, but serves Japanese beer (Kirin on tap!) and the live piano music is American pop. We had to ask for chopsticks.\n\nHaving said that, the service was professional. Our waiter held a hot appetizer for one of our party who was away from the table so that it would not be cold when he returned. We were asked frequently--and not too frequently--if things were ok both by our waiter and the manager/proprietor.\n\nThe food was ok-to-good. Fried shrimp egg rolls were dainty but yummy. Duck was tasty but very chewy. Kung-pao chicken was pleasantly spiced. Plenty of rice. A pitcher of ice water with lemon was left at the table. \n\nAtmosphere was also pleasant. Chairs comfortable, tables spaced well, restrooms large and clean...and there is indeed a large golden Buddha by the entrance.","I took a group of friends here and relatives other times. The place is consistently good for Dim-sum during lunch. It is typical Chinese and nothing fancy.\n\nWhat helps this place is the moat scenery.  3 stars for visiting here based on convenience since there are similar places in town.","Having grown up in Hong Kong and having eaten dim sum in London, NY, LA, SF and Vancouver (actually Richmond), I can confidently say I know my dim sum.\n\nGood selection of well-executed dim sum when the carts actually come around and there's anything left in it.  I'd give it 4 stars for food but the wait definitely detracted from the whole experience.\n\nI think the problem with Golden Buddha is that they can't handle the heavy flow on weekends.  There's not enough regular dim sum eaters like LA that can sustain a steady flow of diners throughout the week, forcing restaurants like Golden Buddha to depend heavily on extra part-time help on weekends.  \n\nDim sum takes serious skill so the chef still ends up doing most of the work.  When we looked into the kitchen, we saw a Chinese woman doing most of the cooking herself.  No wonder it took forever for a cart to come out and when it does, it's swarmed on by a pack of vultures.\n\nIf you're willing to eat at a more simply decorated place with a smaller menu, I'd highly recommend China Chan.  It's much more relaxed - usually no wait on weekends.  An experienced chef makes all the dim sum himself so the menu's much shorter but all the classics are on it.  Anything steamed is made to order so is very fresh.","Situated in the Chinese Cultural Center near the SkyHarbor Airport, this was another pleasant find. All I had was the Dim Sum menu, and I would say this is the best you're gonna get in Phoenix. Still worth the stop to get your Dim Sum fix. The cart ladies were pleasant and very happy to converse with me in Cantonese. Only downside was the chicken sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaves, naw mei gai, was way overcooked, and mushy.","Do you want to eat Chinese Food in an elegant environment on a Friday night in Phoenix? \n\nBe entertained by classic, quiet standards being played live on a piano while you dine?\n\nAre you 50 years old and Caucasian?\n\nThen the Golden Buddha is the place for you! \n\nIts in the Chinese Cultural Center Mall on 44th, and a popular weekend spot for Dim Sum. For a DIm Sum starved Valley of the Sun, Golden Buddha's is decent. \n\nFor dinner, though, it is awfully Americanized and not very authentic Chinese. But with a bunch of American customers coming for dinner, what do you expect? They probably think they are getting \"real Chinese\" food by going to the Chinese Mall, but then again, they are used to PF Chang's or Stix normally in their neighborhood, so this is a step up.\n\nThe best thing about this place is the decor, which is clean and nice, with a Hong Kong Junk boat design covering the ceiling from the bar into the dining room. The next best thing is the Piano interludes on weekend nights. The service is next, which is a little overly eager to remove your plate, and the last thing is the food. \n\nThey do give decent portions. I ordered Guo Teh (potstickers) and got 6 fat ones. But they weren't served with the usual soy, chili oil and vinegar, but a soy and green onions mixture. The Mapo Tofu was ok, as they used a nice silky tofu, which was nice, but no green onions, and sliced black mushrooms instead, which I like, but not in this dish.\n\nCome here for the ambiance and music in the evenings, or on the weekend days for Dim Sum.","Decent dim sum, especially to be found in the middle of the desert. Sadly, the best food I've had in Phoenix.","This place is a little difficult for me to review.  I was staying at the Hampton Inn across the street and this is the closest restaurant so off I went.\n\nI walked in and the owner or manager met me at the door and asked \"how many\"?\n\nI told him I wanted to order take out and handed me a menu and pointed to the waiting area which was covered in newspapers.  I chose to go to the bar, order a glass of wine, and peruse the menu.\n\nThe drinks are expensive but I didn't think the food was.  Less than $10 for my Mongolian Chicken which came with white sticky rice and a fortune cookie.  When ordering I asked if I could have fried rice instead of white rice but was told \"no\".  Most places allow this for a nominal fee.\n\nFine by me.  Give the white rice.  Food was prepared and their to-go boxes were a lot better than the standard white Chinese \"to go\" boxes.  They also included the plastic-ware, napkin, and soy sauce, which a lot of places forget.\n\nLooking around I found a whole lot of goodness along with a couple disappointments.  Most notably the newspaper strewn about and behind the bar, to the right were a lot of boxes stacked in an unsightly fashion.  I could have been a little more presentable in my opinion.\n\nI peeked into the dining room because I wanted to see if the piano music was piped in or live.  It was live which was very nice. Also, the dinning room looked very nice and cozy.\n\nAs I was leaving the same man who greeted me upon entering made sure to wish me a good evening.  My initial impression of the man was that he was surly and testy but that's just how he comes off.\n\nThe food was very good.  The Mongolian sauce was mixture of sweet with spice and the chicken and vegetables all tasted fresh.","My husband and I went there Saturday, the service was great!  Our friends were going to be late so they told us to start.  And start we did!\nThey were serving Dim Sum, something we had never tried, so glad we did, it was wonderful, hubby wouldn't do the chicken feet, but I think next time I will, it looked very good.\nOur friends showed up and ordered their food, and ate all of it, they said that usually they take food home, but it was so good they had to eat all of it!\nWe will be going back very soon!","Let's see, over 50... check \nold white man...........check \neats dinner ...............check \nlistens to the piano  check \n\nwow this must be the place for me, I mean after all it is in a Chinese mall, no make that a Chinese Cultural Center. How could I possibly have discerning taste with such trickery to get me here to eat. \nDude if you are going to rate a restaurant no need to degrade others with your arrogance. \nFool is my review of wanugee N. \n\nNow on the restaurant. The last time we were here the food was not good, the piano was too loud and the waitress had a real attitude. IT won't keep me from going back as I have had good meals and wait service too. \n\nBack to wanugee N. I do not expect any place in Phx. to have authentic Chinese food, by that I mean the street food one finds in China. \nBut I do expect what I fork in to my mouth is worth what I am going to fork over in cost. Even an old white guy like me can tell the difference between good and bad food. No matter what it is called.","Okay so Ive been glum the past few days as I have an impending birthday. Every year this time I get all down in the dumps.. not that I'm not happy with my life cause life is good. Its more like getting further away from my youth and closer to being well, old. All of my grandparents were crotchety, sourpuss drama queens.. is that my fate? Can I break the mold or am I to going to be a crotchety sourpuss?\n\nSo as I contemplate and figure out what I'm going to do with my birthday baggage I decide to squash it with food. All weekend Ive been eating out and having a good time. This is one of the few times outside of a vacation where I will live it completely and to the near of sheer gluttony. So why not dim sum? \n\nIve chowed much dim sum in my 36 years of earthen wear.. of course some good and some bad. I have never been to a place where every dish was great.. Golden Buddha is no exception to this.. they do the basics well enough and have enough funky cool Asian style to keep me interested in returning. The carts around 1130 flow well but around noon it' s full blown freeway action! In fact there might be some road kill in there based on some of the looks on that last steam cart.. \n\nMe and 3 others who were feeling my pain ordered 14, count them, 14 different dishes. One of my friends is from Georgia and had never had dim sum but he is so courageous and unflinching that he was just a blast. Just the shot in the arm to get me out of my funk. I remember the first time I had dim sum.. my eyes wide open, nostrils flared and excited to see what was under the next steamer lid. That was him today.. one exciting thing after the next.. he was even willing to try chicken feet but this is one of those dishes not done very well here. \n\nMy friend took me back to a time where I was younger and less experienced. He looked up to me to guide him through the noodles, bao and sui mai.. like a big brother.. I'm privileged that I could show him something new and exciting and he was so into it! So instead of feeling sorry for myself I felt experienced and useful.. that there is something I can give back to others.. that its not all about me and me aging but about what can be shared with others.\n\nThere is so much more to do, give and feel in this short time we are here.. and Ill do it to, one bite at a time.","The best to be found in land locked Arizona.  My favorite sticky rice is here.  They have dim sum every day, but not a huge selection, though you can order off the menu.  I think it is much bigger on the weekends.  I'm just happy I can get my fix 7 days a week.  Beautiful gardens to walk through, with fish ponds, and a 99 market next door!","I ate at Golden Buddha a few weeks ago.  We ate at the restaurant after a day at the zoo with our 4 year old and had a blast.  The piano bar played tunes for my daughter and the staff was more than accommodating.  The general tso chicken was better than anything I can get in Tucson.  The soup was chocked full of fresh, read FRESH, not canned, vegetables.  All in all, I was very satisfied with the meal and the service.  Plus the decor is very nice, clean and cheery. \n\nEat at Golden Buddha.","For those who gave this place low marks, forgive me. I really like this place. Now I haven't tried various dim sum places so I'm reserving the right to downgrade the place as needed. The variety of food is plentiful, and the carts just keep on coming. I love the steamed pork buns, and the shiu mai (not sure if I spelled that correctly). Yesterday, my favorite pick was the deep fried rolls of taro and shrimp. YUM! I have never ordered from their menu so I can only talk about their dim sum. My friends and I try to go eat dim sum almost every Sunday. It's a cheap way to try new foods, and if you don't like it, well.. you can get away with pushing it aside with minimal guilt. Give it a try! You might be surprised.","I like Golden Buddha, have taken many friends there for Dim Sum.  \nTry not to \"hit\" the dumpling cart to heavy; otherwise cannot finish it to the dessert cart (LOL).\nLove the jasmine tea and the staff willing to help you if you do not understand the what each item is.\nSingapore Rice Noodles a favorite, along with any of the shrimp dumplings; also the broccoli and green beans.\nOnly wish that the carts with eggplant stuffed with shrimp or green peppers with shrimp were not on \"heated\" carts; by the time it gets to you the food is cold.\nOnly concern is that went on 22MAY2010 at 1:30PM; there was a closed sign due to electricity???\nREVISED: 26MAY2010 - called this evening - looks like they are back open again.","I've been to the Golden Buddha on several occasions and it is my favorite, by far, for honest Chinese food. \nWhile I've sampled everything from their vegetarian to their beef, I love their mandarin chicken. More recently, I was delighted to relive the wonders of their Kung Pao Chicken and Beef with Broccoli. \nI absolutely love the egg drop soup and mini crab rangoons that come with the meal.","The very first time I went to Golden Buddha was with my BFF and it was our first dim sum experience. Little did I know this would forever change my life and eating experiences. Although I must admit that first time was a bit awkward.\n\nGB wisely takes reservations which was wonderful (even though it wasn't crazy busy). Our assorted dim sum plates were flavorful and fresh. And the carts seemed to be in constant rotation so we were never too far from a good selection.\n\nWhat really helps GB is its location. The Cofco Center is an experience in itself, where one can have herbs specially blended, select a fresh member of marine life to take home and cook or browse through a store with one of the largest selections of Buddhas and hand fans I've experienced outside of San Francisco.","I've been to Golden Buddha a few times and have not been disappointed. \n\nThey have a LARGE selection of Dim Sum and if you're not careful you can get carried away.\n\nTry and get there early and you'll get the best and most fresh selection.\nMake sure you walk around the garden when you're done.","Probably the most comprehensive Chinese menu in the Valley.  Pick from well over 100 dishes, but if you want the best order the Peking Duck.  Everything else is very good, but without a wow factor.  You'll see lots of Chinese people in this massive restaurant, which probably means they're doing a fine job in the kitchen.","I very much enjoyed eating here. Food was great. Fairly fast service. Wasn't expensive either for the 4 of us.","Golden Buddha has GREAT dim sum.  Their prices are reasonable and the staff is very polite wheeling their little carts.  I tend to go on the weekend because there is more selection but they do dim sum throughout the week.  They also have some very authentic dishes on the menu for those who are more of the adventurous types.  Be sure to say hello to the turtles the next time you go.","This place in the Chinese Cultural Center has a very pretty and elegant bar area. I was pleased to learn that they had some very reasonable and delicious happy hour snacks. This is a good place for a Pina Colada. I had one by myself along with some dumplings and fried shrimp appetizer. Sadly I never brought anyone else here with me. It was happy hour heaven but you know? A lot of my friends in AZ pretty much hang out in one neighborhood or another and nobody I know really lives close to the Buddha.\nThe airport is pretty close by. This might be a good pre-flight send-off location.","I have had dim sum in New Orleans and Phoenix (not SF), and this is about equal to the best of New Orleans as far as flavor.\nAs for ambiance, today was a good day. I've had dim sum here about a dozen times, and have had very good service and quality 90% of the time, including weekends. I have had bad days here, but since today was good, I'll rate accordingly. It's closer to a 4.5, but since I can't give half-stars, I rounded up.\nDon't expect me to give these the right names, but... I was less than impressed with the bbq pork balls. They tasted too much like honey and the beef was minimal. The bbq sauce tasted bottled. Outside of that, their herbal hot tea is delicious even on a hot day.\nThe shu mai were very good, and the shrimp in a spinach dumpling was fantastic. A definite don't miss is their sticky rice in lotus leaf. It's among the best I've had anywhere. Just be careful; you'll find bones in it every once in a while. Go for any of their steamed dumplings; they're very flavorful. As others have said, I love the Chinese broccoli, but you'll only find it on the carts on weekends. Otherwise order it off the menu.\nToday (11:30 lunch) the carts came around often, and everything except the pork buns was piping hot and fresh. By the way, despite the price increases, even the sticky rice was considered a medium size entree, and the two of us eating there escaped with a bill under $20 and we were done in under 30 minutes.\nI strongly recommend the dim sum here, whether you've had it a million times or have never had it before. You usually won't be disappointed.","I don't really understand the poor reviews on this place.....maybe it depends on the day you go? We went on a Sunday, it was crazy busy, but service was great! (of course, my view of customer service is a little different then the rest... I used to live on an island where you were just happy to find what you were looking for, let alone expect good customer service) Anyways, our server was very sweet! Always had a smile on her face. The carts served us promplty and none of the food was cold. They always had whatever we wanted (I hate having to wait for the next cart).\n\nNow, as for the actual dim sum and food.......holy cow, to die for! So flavorful and fresh!! The broccoli makes you sing...and the wine noodles, make you cry. You leave with very weird mixed emotions, but mostly a happy belly full of yummy food.\n\nIn my opinion, this is the best dim sum I have been able to find in Phx. I'm ditching my previous spot (Mekong Palace) and will be back to Golden Buddha when the dim sum monster strikes again!"],"type":["Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low

hotel and not really having eaten much all day, I was hungry.\n\nThe service was terrible....no one knew what they were doing so it took 10 minutes to get a freaking slice of pizza and then when said pizza came it was NASTY.\n\nMy husband once got a pizza in Milwaukee where they put Kraft singles on it as cheese and Pizza Parma is just behind that for worst pizza ever.","Looking for a quick bite to eat and a local told me this was \"the best pizza in the city.\"  I got a plain slice and a pepperoni slice. Possibly the worst pizza I have ever eaten.  This wouldn't even qualify as pizza in North Jersey.  I ate half of the plain slice because I was starving....then threw both in the garbage.  \n\nIf this is really the best pizza in Pittsburgh... wow.","I ordered from Pizza Parma out of storm necessity. I ordered a chicken parmigiana \"hoagie\", which was dry and luke warm. The potato bacon soup was like something out of a can, except the chunks of potato were hard and undercooked..all pretty nasty and overly salty.\n\nNever order from them.","Zero stars. Came in 10 mins before close. Female manager on duty asked for $100 in exchange for a pizza. When we refused she said she could not serve us because her employees had been working since 9am..,it is currently 2:00 am... Sounds pretty illegal to me","Average pizza. But with ten guys working - and not much business at the moment - it still took twenty minutes to get a slice of pepperoni. I'll walk across the street next time.","My butthole hasn't been right for days, nor my stomach. \n\nWe ordered in because we all had a long day and were set to have a family movie night.\n\nA pizza and hoagie. \n\nThe hoagie wasn't anything to run and go scream from the rooftops about but the pizza was covered in little ass ruining intestinal demons and this I am nearly sure of.\n\nI had to be talked out of sending pizza Parma a bill for several rolls of toilet paper.\n\nBe weary of the pizza, distrustful actually.\n\nYour butthole will thank me for it!","Hubby and I dropped in after a hellish morning at the Social Security office. Hubby loves pizza so we made a stop.\n\nPizza wan't bad, it was actually pretty decent. But the place was disgusting and the cashier was incredibly rude.","I eat this pizza all the time when downtown, usually when running around at events like First Night or the Gallery Crawls...not the best pizza I have ever had in my life, but it's not bad!  And I haven't ever gotten sick from it.  Just wanted to offer a different opinion.","PIzza Parma's decent tasting mega-big-2ft-long hot sausage hoagie was let down by the piss poor attitude of the staff, the lack of cleanliness of the tables and floor, the out-of-order red door restroom, the bright yellow for no-explicable reason walls. \n\nThe large color-striped 80's retro tables and green chairs have come back in style but this win is purely accidental and achieved only by laziness and lack of renovation.\n\nThat is all.","My fiance & I have lived in downtown Pittsburgh for over a year + now & this place is fabulous. \nMy sweetie LOVES LOVES LOVESSS pizza & we order from here a ton.  We haven't ordered anything here that wasn't super tasty.\nThe shop is small & the decor is super bright which makes you want to get in & out quickly but who the hell eats in there anyways. ... you're grabbing your order & running.","I'm glad I listened to my friend's recommendation and not some of these bad reviews. We're just in town for the night and wanted something delivered to our hotel. They said it would take an hour, which I expected on Super Bowl Sunday right at game time, but it was here in less than half an hour. \n\nThe pizza was delicious! Just the right balance of cheese and a tasty sauce, generous with the toppings, and a nicely crispy crust but not too thin.","This place has great service! My best friend and I got 2 custom orders and the older guy in back came out to the register to take our orders personally.  I assume he's either the cook, owner, or both. We ordered 2 cheeselss pizzas; a lot of places mess this up. Pizza Parma however, makes great cheeseless pizza. Our personal pizzas were nice and toasty, not over nor undercooked, and it was not dried out at all! There was more than enough sauce mmmmmmmmm.","My fiance & I have lived in downtown Pittsburgh for over a year + now & this place is fabulous. \nMy sweetie LOVES LOVES LOVESSS pizza & we order from here a ton.

This place didn't even deserve a star! I order 1 sandwich and it took 20min to make and this was at 4:26pm they where not busy. When I got the sandwich (number 11) it only had TWO Slices of meat and a tons of carrots. This place has gone to the dumps the only thing health about this place is your jaw gets a workout from chewing the hard French bread! I'd rather go to subway and I hate subway. I'll never go here again.\n\n***Look at every French roll sandwich picture and you can see the amount of meat if you can see the meat at all!***","I would give it zero star if I could because of food safety reason. My husband and I went here for brunch. He ordered a grilled pork banh mi stuffed with some suspiciously bright-colored meat, pickled veggies, and raw cilantro. I got a breakfast sandwich with cooked eggs, ham, and cheese on croissant. Later that day, my husband started to feel sick - lack of appetite, light headed, and slight diarrhea. The diarrhea was getting much worse that night and the symptoms lasted for 2 days after we put him on anti-diarrhea medicines. We believe it was due to food poisoning from the banh mi since we ate otherwise the same food that day. We had banh mi regularly in other places and we never had any issue. This place charged less for a reason. I feel grossly sick when I think about the who-knows-what meat like stuff and RAW veggies. Beware of the food safety issues here!","Mediocre sandwiches.  To much bread and only a small amount of meat.  They don't even taste good at all, nothing special about them.  The Thai tea here is good and I've heard the same about the coffees, but I won't be eating here again.","I ordered a #2 pork roll sandwich.   I nearly chipped/broke my tooth biting into it.  Sandwich was hard as a rock.  \nVery disappointing compared to California's lee sandwiches.","Very good/cheap Vietnamese sandwiches..I wouldn't call it fast food...more like painfully slow...I think there is one guy preparing all the food :-/...it's cash only but I'd advise not to use their ATM..it only gave me $20 but debted me $60...when I asked the guy who I saw refilling the machine he waived me off and told me to go to the cashier..I was ready to call the cops!","Service is always great and fast. Food is cheap! Coming from Hawaii and LA, I have been exposed to some pretty darn good Vietnamese sandwiches that feature fried tofu. So being that I've relocated here, this was the only place so far that has authentic Vietnamese style sandwiches. I've had the vegetarian one quite a few times, and although I am super happy with it in general, it does not have slabs of BBQ tofu as I'm used to... I wish it did!! With out a juicy tofu inside, this vege sandwich tends to be dry and lacking the kick and the fillings that I'm used to getting in Hawaii and LA. I get the feeling like Arizona is not a tofu happy place. I very rarely see it on menus as I do in Hawaii and LA. :( I think this sandwich would be killer if they used real pieces of BBQ'd tofu. I'm still happy to go there and get a sandwich since its the only Vietnamese place that offers a vege Vietnamese sandwich that I could find.","The bread was very good.   The sandwich (pastrami) was just average.\n\nPrices are all reasonable and a pretty large menu.  I'm guessing  (hoping)  some of the asian sandwiches  rise above average.\n\nProbably  a 3.5.","Loved the veggie summer rolls though a bit highly priced. The BBQ pork sandwich is good because I don't like pate and most other places put pate. I was let down to find out later i was charged 30 cent for jalape\u00f1os and they didn't say anything.","As a Southern Californian, I wouldn't go to Lee's Sandwiches because there are just so many better and even cheaper Banh mi joints. However, in AZ, the options are pretty limited. Definitely helped curb my Banh mi cravings but the sandwiches were seriously skimpy. The mint milk was not minty at all but the fresh pressed nuoc mia (sugar cane juice)  was super refreshing.","I had their pork sandwich and it was very flavorful but there was a lot of fat that you have to work around.","\"Fresh\" Hot Baguette, Croissant!!  OMG \nBut when their are not fresh is like regular bread in the market \nRecently try salami sandwich and don't remember pork one excellent","One bite of the jambon and pate sandwich and I'm taken back to the summers I spent in France as a college kid. Excellent baguettes and great French-style sandwiches. I walk out after lunch wondering where my backpack and Eurail pass are...\n\nWish they were open late enough to grab a bite on the way home after a long day at work.","If you like good, fresh, sandwiches, then you have to try one here at Lee's. I think the bread is what really makes the difference, it is super fresh and would taste good all by itself! Its much cheaper than any other sandwich shop and definitely seems fresher and less assembly line. I think the only thing that can be hit or miss here is the service from time to time, but that is soon forgotten with a sniff of the fresh bread.  Yes they do only accept cash but that is as they say, to keep the prices down.  I usually order the ham and turkey club and a water and i get out of there for about 5 bucks.  I also love the fresh baked baguettes...so good!","I can't believe there's now a Lee's Sandwiches within a hop, skip and a jump from me here in Chandler.  I usually get my Viet-Sammy fix at their location in one of the grittiest, seediest parts of SF. \n\nIn fact, I haven't gone in quite some time because I hate that part of the city, so now that they're nearby in Chandler, I'll get my fix while I can, even if their sammies are skinnier than those in sF.  All good though, since for these prices, I can just pig out by eating two.  Talk about changing demographics!!\n\nGood times guaylo!!!","My family and I frequently visit this sandwich shop whenever we're near the area. The shop is clean, tidy, and has plenty of tables for those who are looking for a very casual dining experience. The baguettes and croissants have always been warm and  freshly baked on every single of the visits I have made here. I personally like the Turkey Club and Bacon Sandwich (with your choice of it being on a baguette or croissant) and costs about $6. My only complaint is that there usually isn't very much meat on the sandwich in relation to the bread - oh, well. They also serve ice cream (the vanilla fudge with M&Ms is my favorite), smoothies, and other fun little drinks. The service is usually always very decent as well. \n\nBe sure to bring cash, this place doesn't take credit cards.","This place has a huge area for seating and is generally pretty busy and packed with Asians which is saying that it is a good cheap place to eat.\n\nThe in house baked baguette bread for their sandwich are awesome. My favorite is the bbq pork sandwich with double meat. If you don't get the double meat you are eating almost just bread. Their spring rolls are pretty good and a decent size and their little egg rolls are a good buy. \n\nYou can't beat the prices here for an inexpensive meal.","I mainly come here for the Asian sandwiches #11(combination) and #6(bbq pork) to be exact.  They are delicious and their service is great.  The only thing I am not a fan of is their eggrolls.  They are crispy but they don't have a flavorful impact when you bite into them.","Grilled pork is amazing! I was hesitant in trying the grilled pork but my sister suggested it.  I'm glad I took the chance.  Love the fresh bread.  Smells so yummy!","I enjoy coming here when I'm in the mood for Vietnamese sandwiches. The place is big and always clean. You never have to wait long to get your food. The bread is fresh but I feel that it always cuts the roof of my mouth. So I would recommend getting the grilled pork sandwich. It's my favorite to get because the grilled pork makes the bread soft so it's not as hard to eat. I also enjoy the avocado smoothie and the egg rolls.  The only thing I don't like about this place is that it's cash only. I never carry cash on me so every time I want to eat here I have to go to the ATM","Oh banh mi, how I love the, your pickled veggies and meat, they don't taste like.... Feet? So.... Maybe I'll stick to the actual reviews and not poetry. \n\nI first came here a couple years ago, as a recommendation from a friend. I usually get the chicken banh mi, and a vegetarian one and put it in the freezer (for later on that night TBH). The mayo and bread are so good, I would recommend getting here earlier for really fresh bread. And beware, I've gotten a mouth full of jalape\u00f1o midway through the sandwich, which was mildly amusing to my date.\n\nALSO. Cash only! They do have an ATM inside though, in case of emergency.y","Love the BBQ pork sandwich!","This place has great bread. Their baguettes are nice and crunchy.  Their sandwiches are reasonably priced . Their meat portions are a little small I recommend maybe an upgrade but they add picked vegetables and some jalape\u00f1os to make a very tasty.i sandwich. Their croissant are some of the best in town the only drawback they only accept cash service can sometimes be a little slow","Usually really tastes sandwiches. The CS is lacking, but the bakery is the best. \nAlso, they only accept cash$$$","4 for the incredible fresh baguettes made there. Fab $1 bins for day old bread, and great to-go selections. Been coming here for years. Last few visits have been disappointing for sandwiched-and I've been coming here for years. Very strong iced coffee. Hard bread on viet sandwiches and subs :( great croissant sandwhiches.","If you don't know about this place then STOP what you are doing right now and go get one of their sandwiches.  It's cheap and good.  That's it!  Enjoy!","I went there not to long ago & I was greeted by a very nice girl, lupe! It is amazingggg! She prepared my smoothie, which was bomb! (: deffinatley go!","Freshly baked French baguettes and pastries, strong Vietnamese iced coffee, and delicious sandwiches here. You can't really go wrong here, but do bring cash; they don't take credit or debit cards here (though there is an ATM inside). The prices are reasonable and the place is kept clean. It's always a pleasure to come here.","These baguettes are nothing to joke about. They are as good if not better than any baguette I've had in Europe. I can't speak for anything else here but I'll be back to try.","Best banh mi sandwich in Arizona. Wish I lived closer, but it is worth the trip on the weekend for a delicious, fresh, authentic banh mi. French horns are to die for, get there when they open and they will still be a little warm. Cash only!","I'll tell you the bummer first. Lee's is CASH-ONLY. If you don't have cash, they do have a private ATM in the dining room that will rape you with a hefty service charge. But...it's worth it. Get back in line and wait for a tasty American style sandwich, but do it on a croissant....good, or step out of your comfort zone and try a Viet sub on a crusty French baguette loaf..BEST (#11 Special combo rocks!)  Whatever you do, if you DON\"T like jalapenos, tell them! \n\nOther items of note are to be found in the hot-case. Ready-to-eat spicy chicken wings, crunchy thin egg rolls, and a little treat called 'pate chaud'. Picture of a buttery, flaky exterior, almost like filo-dough, with a hot pork or chicken meatball on the inside. They're great for breakfast! \n\nSmoothies? Oh yeah, with or w/o boba balls. Avocado (l know , I know...but you just have to try it). or mango..","Amazing sandwiches, fresh bread on the #5 pork sandwich is amazing (bahn mi) so light and simple but full of good Vietnamese flavor. The other speciality teas and drinks look amazing, will explore more on next visit!","Lees is the place for a great, cheap and fresh sandwich... a couple of suggestions..  They make fresh Baguettes every day and are $1.50 ea. I recommend a smoothie, they are very very good. And dont forget its CASH ONLY.","Cheap eats done machine-gun style. If you're expecting fawning service and polite smalltalk, keep walking, because Lee's is all about getting you in and out. Especially during the lunch crush. \n\nThat's fine with me, because really all I want is to pick up my bag of relatively inexpensive sandwiches and get on with things. \n\nFor more adventurous eaters, there are a wide variety of Asian sandwiches-and the menu is growing all the time. For the timid, all your favorite Sysco near-meat products are available on baguette or croissant. In addition to sandwiches, they have a small variety of Asian-street-foody options, many blended and mixed (soft) drinks, ice cream, and a dozen variations on the ever-popular highly-caffeinated Vietnamese coffee. \n\nOccasionally it smells faintly like cat pee, but that seems to coincide with the appearance of a fresh batch of durian ice cream. Durian: when smelling terrible is the sign of wholesome freshness!","Love the banh mi. I won't say it's the best I've ever had, but it's darn good...especially considering that Lee's Sandwich Shop is a chain. The bread is crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Wish it came with a little more meat. You can request it, but it costs extra. ;) The BBQ pork sandwich is pretty good too. Their service is fast and efficient, and they are pretty friendly. I LOVE their iced coffee. Perfect amount of coffee/condensed milk ratio. Nice strong flavor, even tho there is a lot of ice. FYI, they use chipped ice, so it will definitely come up the staw. It doesnt bother me, but some of my friends hate that. ;)","Pros: They have some of the freshest sandwiches around, and they are even cheaper (and healthier) than the nasty $5 foot long subs at Subway. Lees serves both Asian and American sandwiches as well as pastries, breads, ice scream and delicious drinks. Some of the best foods here are their pastries, so definitely try their croissants, muffins and beignets. Their sandwiches are served either on croissants or french bread (whichever you prefer).  I love their grilled chicken sandwich.\n\nCons: This is a CASH ONLY place so make sure you have that handy or else you have to use the generic ATM (with fees). \n\nAlso, try their iced coffee. It's amazing!  But make sure you ask them to go easy on the ice because they like to fill the entire cup full of ice while only giving you a little bit of coffee. Im always done in about 2 sips, so my trips have been better since I asked for them to hold the ice a bit.","Really dig this place. It's certainly unique! The main disappointment of the visit was I did not order the coffee.. It looked delicious. Next time...","You've gotta come here and get one of their baguettes.  They are the freshest, softest and most flavorful baguettes from anywhere in the whole Valley.  One of their fresh warm baguettes and a couple of tablespoons of soft, sweet cream butter and you have yourself the best breakfast in the world!\n\nThey also create amazing Vietnamese sandwiches using those same delicious baguettes.  It's all amazingly fresh and tasty, but we forewarned before you arrive that they are a cash only operation, so hit up your bank's ATM on the way, or pay the convenience fee to use the freestanding ATM inside of Lee's.","The iced coffee is the best!!! The bread for sandwhiches is tastey, but a little hard to eat. The fresh veges on the sandwhiches are really good, before if you don't like jalepe jalape\u00f1os, they put fresh ones on there as well."],"type":["Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Medium Rating","Medium Rating","Medium Rating","Medium Rating","Medium Rating","High Rating","High Rating","High Rating","High Rating","High Rating","High Rating","High Rating","High Rating","High Rating","High Rating","High Rating","High Rating","High Rating","High Rating","High Rating","High Rating","High Rating","High Rating","High Rating","High Rating","High Rating","High Rating","High Rating","High Rating","High Rating","High Rating","High Rating","High Rating"],"type_color":["#E0E0E0","#E0E0E0","#FEF5D6","#E0E0E0","#E0E0E0","#E0E0E0","#E0E0E0","#E39A73","#E39A73","#E0E0E0","#E0E0E0","#E0E0E0","#C01400","#E0E0E0","#C01400","#E0E0E0","#E0E0E0","#E0E0E0","#E0E0E0","#E0E0E0","#E0E0E0","#C01400","#E0E0E0","#C01400","#E0E0E0","#C01400","#E0E0E0","#C01400","#E0E0E0","#E0E0E0","#C01400","#C01400","#C01400","#C01400","#C01400","#E0E0E0","#E0E0E0","#C01400"]}},"id":"3d294018-cc3f-43bf-b0a8-1782e5b668ab","type":"ColumnDataSource"},{"attributes":{"plot":{"id":"10440289-f06f-4153-b1e9-cbb65907bfe4","subtype":"Figure","type":"Plot"}},"id":"522a7167-27ce-4de5-9d0a-cb24f1a28627","type":"PreviewSaveTool"},{"attributes":{"callback":null,"column_names":["symx","type","business_name","actual_review","display","period","error","business_rating","namey","text_review","type_color","group","pred_rating"],"data":{"actual_review":["1","1","1","2","3","3","4","4","5","5","5","5","5","5","5","5","5","5","5","5","5","5","5","5","5","5","5","5"],"business_name":["Alla Famiglia","Alla Famiglia","Alla Famiglia","Alla Famiglia","Alla Famiglia","Alla Famiglia","Alla Famiglia","Alla Famiglia","Alla Famiglia","Alla Famiglia","Alla Famiglia","Alla Famiglia","Alla Famiglia","Alla Famiglia","Alla Famiglia","Alla Famiglia","Alla Famiglia","Alla Famiglia","Alla Famiglia","Alla Famiglia","Alla Famiglia","Alla Famiglia","Alla Famiglia","Alla Famiglia","Alla Famiglia","Alla Famiglia","Alla Famiglia","Alla Famiglia"],"business_rating":[4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5],"display":["Stars : 1","Stars : 1","Stars : 1","Stars : 2","Stars : 3","Stars : 3","Stars : 4","Stars : 4","Stars : 5","Stars : 5","Stars : 5","Stars : 5","Stars : 5","Stars : 5","Stars : 5","Stars : 5","Stars : 5","Stars : 5","Stars : 5","Stars : 5","Stars : 5","Stars : 5","Stars : 5","Stars : 5","Stars : 5","Stars : 5","Stars : 5","Stars : 5"],"error":["0","-4","-2","0","0","-1","0","0","0","0","2","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","2","0"],"group":["4","3","1","2","2","1","20","9","22","21","19","18","17","16","1","13","12","11","10","8","7","6","5","4","3","2","15","14"],"namey":["4:0.5","3:0.5","1:0.5","2:0.5","2:0.5","1:0.5","20:0.5","9:0.5","22:0.5","21:0.5","19:0.5","18:0.5","17:0.5","16:0.5","1:0.5","13:0.5","12:0.5","11:0.5","10:0.5","8:0.5","7:0.5","6:0.5","5:0.5","4:0.5","3:0.5","2:0.5","15:0.5","14:0.5"],"period":["Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Medium Rating","Medium Rating","High Rating","High Rating","High Rating","High Rating","High Rating","High Rating","High Rating","High Rating","High Rating","High Rating","High Rating","High Rating","High Rating","High Rating","High Rating","High Rating","High Rating","High Rating","High Rating","High Rating","High Rating","High Rating"],"pred_rating":["1","5","3","2","3","4","4","4","5","5","3","5","5","5","5","5","5","5","5","5","5","5","5","5","5","5","3","5"],"symx":["Low Rating:0.5","Low Rating:0.5","Low Rating:0.5","Low Rating:0.5","Medium Rating:0.5","Medium Rating:0.5","High Rating:0.5","High Rating:0.5","High Rating:0.5","High Rating:0.5","High Rating:0.5","High Rating:0.5","High Rating:0.5","High Rating:0.5","High Rating:0.5","High Rating:0.5","High Rating:0.5","High Rating:0.5","High Rating:0.5","High Rating:0.5","High Rating:0.5","High Rating:0.5","High Rating:0.5","High Rating:0.5","High Rating:0.5","High Rating:0.5","High Rating:0.5","High Rating:0.5"],"text_review":["The first time I went here was with a group - we had reserved the entire restaurant for a retirement party.   I had a horrible experience.  Vowed never to go back!  At that time, I even had a terrible interaction with the owner.\n\nThis time I was invited with a couple of girlfriends because they love it. Decided to try again since it was more about the \"get together\" than the food/location.\n\nThis time, overpriced food and bad service.  Overall, it was not anything out of the ordinary and not worth the price.   I had the veal speciality.   Large portion, but ok.  Staff was not very attentive for the small amount of customers present.\n\nI am a Pittsburgh native.  This is a bad neighborhood. \n\nI am NOT interested in ever going back!","No better in taste than a Fazoli or even an Olive Garden.  Inflated prices, like the cheapest entree was $40, try to disguise this place as something it is not.  Went with a group of co workers, so we pretty much got everything on the menu and not one thing stuck out really good.  Service is incredibly slow.  Not worth it at all.  Even if you tell yourself that atleast the portions are large, the food is just not good enough to warrant wasting a meal eating there.","The menu online gives no prices, and the entrees are ridiculously overpriced for what you get - a good meal, but far too much food, and nothing extraordinary. The entrees are $50 - $60. BE WARNED - if you want atmosphere to go with your $60 entree, you'd better REQUEST DOWNSTAIRS! Otherwise you can have your anniversary dinner in a small room in front of large televisions. Who knew? And the staff will definitely not accommodate your request for a more romantic spot - even if they know it is your tenth anniversary! Wow. Should have walked out.","I do not say this with many 2 star ratings but I would like to go back for another try.  The reason is simple, in reading the reviews below, I have to assume we hit Alla Famigilia on a bad night, at least I hope so.  The main reason for the low rating was the service.  We were seated on the third floor which is their bar area, at a high top table and the bar tender was our server.  She had to mix drinks for every table on the third floor, tend to the patrons at the bar and come around to wait on our table.  That was not fair to her and definitely not fair to us.  Her service and attentiveness lacked for obvious reasons but even when she was \"free\" she walked by our table without a glance and was apparently hard of hearing.  Furthermore, when ever one person got her attention for another drink or something, she said okay and left, without giving anyone else a chance to order.  The rest of the staff tried to pick up the slack a little but they were jammed as well.  Sounds weird, but I never felt so rushed in a 3 hour dinner.  The food took awhile, which is fine and expected on a busy Saturday night, just keep the drinks flowing and stop by once in a awhile so we don't notice.\n\nI also did not like that we were seated at a high top table.  I love the high tops for drinks and a few apps but for a 3 hour meal, these were uncomfortable, especially if your legs didn't hit the chair cross bars correctly (either too short or too tall).\n\nThe food was good, very good in some instances and disappointing in one.  I loved the pasta with Vodka sauce and the salad, both part of the entree which is unusual for a high end restaurant.  The meatball appetizer and the calamari and shrimp appetizer were the best things I ate all evening.  The biggest disappointment was the veal chop.  I love a good bone in veal chop but was leaning towards a seafood dish. I ended up changing my mind right before I ordered as I saw the veal chop brought out to another table and it looked amazing.  The disappointment was it was over-cooked.  It came out medium well at best (closer to well) and for $68, and for the amount they were serving that night, they should know how to cook them to perfection.  Not a spot of pink to be found.  No one even asked us during our meal if everything was okay or any issues.  When most of the chop remained on my plate and everyone else's entree was 90% eaten, not even a \"was everything okay\".  Just clear me out and get on with the next one.\n\nI hope to have the opportunity to go back and I will not be seated in the third floor bar area and I will not get my same waitress and give it another try.  I expected so much more.","We had the mushrooms, meatball appetizer, pasta, salad, veal piccata and spaghetti with clam sauce. A nice pasta dish with roasted veggies and marinara was made as a special order. But I was not wowed by this restaurant. Large portions are not enough to impress me. The tastes were good, but for the prices, I'd expect better. If you're a big meat eater, or love to eat huge amounts of pasta, ok, this is great. But the sauces were just ok, nothing spectacular. Spaghetti with clams was covered with red pepper flakes but not noted as such on the menu. Would you like someone to cover your pizza slice with red pepper flakes without asking? I'm sure the deserts are good but we didn't have any - but the sizes of the appetizers and entrees is just over the top, but not worth the premium prices to me.","The food was delicious. But it is a ridiculously expensive restaurant. If you're intimidated by spending $100 or more on a complete meal for 1 person, then this is not the place for you. Knowing that we had other plans for our evening, my date and I cut the meal short with appetizers, salad, and a bottle of one of the lesser expensive wines they offer, which was $54 a bottle. Our check was still $120, and we left hungry. Which is a shame, because the little of what we did have, we fully enjoyed. There are plenty of Italian restaurants in Pittsburgh, and many of them are very, very good - where one can enjoy a meal for a fraction of what it costs here.","This used to be my secret place, but I've told so many people about it that I have a hard time getting a reservation.  I've known Jonathan (chef/owner) for a few years and he's done some good improvements.  He's added a bar upstairs which is very cool and they also have a patio that's great.  I had a dinner party there in the summer and have another one planned in March and Jonathan totally goes the extra effort to make it special.  He arranged for a dj last time, so we were able to dance off some of his food.  Okay, the food is great.  I especially recommend the Veal Chop.  The staff is awesome. I really like Marney and Errol (two main servers) and I like Jordan the bartender upstairs (Marney's daughter).  I'd like to give this place 5 stars, but it has a few smaller problems.  It's a little bit pricey.  The good is that the cost does include salad, pasta, and bread, but the bad is that you'll easily spend $50 on an entree.  The Veal Chop is $65.  That's a little much, especially considering the location.  The dishes also which are delicious are simply toooooo big.  I mean literally you can three meals out of one entree,  I would suggest some smaller plates especially for the bar.  One last tip, even though it's not BYOB anymore, you can still BYOB.  He won't turn you away.  This is one of my favorite restaurants.  The chef is really talented and I'd hazard a guess that if he was in New York he could be a celebrity chef if he wanted.  He's got the personality.","The food is unforgettable, but unfortunately so is the bill.  Sicilian themed with fresh ingredients in an intimate setting all prepared in an open kitchen.\n\nAsk before you order a special, or you might be stunned when you are handed the check. But if you love food and money is no object, this is your place. A great place for Valentine's day or a special anniversary splurge, with the emphasis on the word 'splurge'.","Old school Italian. Enough said. This place sets the standard for great Italian food.\nThe meatballs are a muct have and the pastas are incredible.\nI had a veal chop with long hots. It just doesn't get any better.\nAnd don't miss the tiramisu. As good as it gets.","First, the Veal Milanese is easily the best veal chop I've had anywhere. Ever. And I've had plenty of veal.  Second, the veal chop is definitely in my top 5 favorite dishes I've ever had, ever. \n\nFantastic restaurant. The relatively new chef has made this place even better than it was. This is THE most underrated restaurant on Yelp in Pittsburgh. Great service, extremely friendly staff, fantastic atmosphere.\n\nBe sure to come hungry. You cannot leave unsatisfied. Meals typically last me 3-4 hours, but I take my time. BYOB is a bonus too. \n\nIn summary, Alla Famiglia is consistently the best restaurant in Pittsburgh. Try it if you have not, and you won't be disappointed.","I have been frequenting Alla Famiglia since 2007 and it is still my favorite Italian restaurant in Pittsburgh and perhaps my favorite in the world!  \n\nChef Jonathan is a genius - his \"Veal Chop Milanese\" with lump crab, toasted pine nuts, and lemon is the BEST I've ever had.  Every time we eat here, my husband orders this dish and refuses to try anything else - that's how AMAZING it is.  \n\nI have tried a variety of entrees - everything from the the Veal Chop Pizzaiolo to the Steak il pizzaiolo to the Medallions of veal Pomodoro ai Pepperoni.  Each dish is infused with deliciousness that makes these entrees OUT OF THIS WORLD!  \n\nYou have got to try the following:  mozzarella (apptz), hot peppers (apptz), mozzarella stuffed meatball (apptz), vodka pasta (automatically received with your meal - sauce is delicious), veal chop milanese (entr\u00e9e).  \n\nYou won't be disappointed - the kitchen is open so you can even watch as Chef Jonathan prepares your dinner.  \n\nMake a reservation.  Neighborhood is a bit sketchy so be careful.  \n\nPS.  I've taken all my friends, family, and business partners (many who do not live in Pittsburgh) here and everyone absolutely loves it and wishes they lived in Pitt so they could come here more often.  In fact, we no longer live in Pittsburgh, but every time we come into town for a visit, we HAVE to eat dinner at our favorite Alla Famiglia!","This is my second review of Alla Famalgia and again this place gets five stars. I loved every part of my meal. I started out with the twelve ounce stuffed meatball and the truffled mushroom appetizers. The waiter invited me to watch as the mushrooms were being prepared at the kitchen counter. There I chatted with the chef as he prepared my app. Explaining as he went on, first slicing fresh chantrel, portobellos, and button mushrooms. Next he saut\u00e9 them in olive oil, added brown sugar, brandy, raisins, and finished it with heavy cream. They were fantastic. There were a variety of specials including wild boar chops, a risotto with prawns, scallops, and black truffles. But I chose the dry aged filet with lump crab in a leek cream. It was the best piece of filet I've ever had. It was easily a pound of beef and a half pound of crab in a light cream sauce with leeks. I could barely touch it after the pasta, salad, bread, and appetizers. I brought my leftovers home and have them another time. Dessert consisted of a nice portion of carrot cake with an apricot cream cheese icing with apricot jam filling. It was a nice take on an old favorite. For the four of us the bill was over 300 dollars, but well worth it for the attentive service and extremely well prepared food.","Spent the weekend in the city with some friends. This was our first time to Alla Famiglia.  Unbelievable!!!  We enjoyed everything.  If you are looking for high quality food with a great friendly staff, this is it.  It is a little out of the way but it is worth the trip.  If I had the option to give 6 stars I would do it.   Very impressive.","While visiting the Pittsburgh area, my wife and I were intrigued by the excellent reviews we found of Alla Familgia.  While it was a bit of a drive from Cranberry Township, we needed a dining reprieve after a disappointing visit at BRAVO! Cucina Italiana.  East Warrington Avenue is undergoing major construction which made finding parking a bit difficult, fortunately there is valet service in a lot to the side of the restaurant which we took advantage of.  \nUpon entering, we were warmly welcomed by the host.  We visited on a stormy evening and were fortunate to find that some reservations had been cancelled due to the weather, which enabled us to get a table.  I strongly advise to get reservations in advance.  We were seated on the first floor with a view of the chefs cooking.  Awesome.\nAll that has been said in prior reviews, I heartily agree with.  The bread, cheese, and dipping oil was a delicious start.  Ingredients were fresh.  The pasta and main course dishes were done perfectly.  My wife had the Gorgonzola Filet Mignon, which she described as one of the best meals she has ever eaten.\nWhen we are in the area, we'll be back.","I was in Pittsburgh (my hometown) for a visit from Boston.  I was so pleased with the meal at this restaurant.  It was by far the best restaurant I have ever been to in the Burgh.  The wait staff, chef, food, was stellar.  We are known for very good restaurants in Boston and this restaurant could be in Boston or NYC it is that fantastic!  I would highly recommend going here if you have a special occasion, date night, or just want a superb meal.","FACT: Thee best Italian meal I've had in the Burgh, hands down!\nFACT: I ate so much I thought they would have to wheel me out on a stretcher.\nFACT: It's a serious hidden gem in a slightly sketchy neighborhood.\n\nNeed some more info, because I'm comin' atcha with the goods! To start they set the table with \"Holy Oil,\" which is banana pepper olive oil for dipping Italian bread in, a seasoned cecci bean and cheese gustoso and a goat cheese and olive spread. I wish they sold that banana pepper olive oil because I wanted to have it every day of my life! \n\nWe ordered the famous Meatball appetizer. This meatball is for serious! It's massive and stuffed with mozzarella cheese. Yep, I'm for realz. It was just oozing Italian sexiness, in a ball. As soon as I tasted the red sauce, it tasted like my Grandma's, which sparked fond memories and made me want to actually live in this place. \n\nWe also ordered the Trifolata, which is assorted mushrooms and currants in marsala cream. It was also incredible. The bad/good of it was that it wasn't really needed because they give you so much food, but it was delicious, so whatever!\n\nFor the Third course they serve you your choice of pasta either with their famous home made vodka sauce or fettucini. But here's the thing, the fettucini is made in front of you... in a cheese wheel. Yep, I'm for realz again! I know I'm crazy for not ordering it, but I really love me some vodka sauce and was incredibly happy with this amazing homemade sauce. My hubby got the fetticini and loved it. See, we're all happy here!\n\nFourth course is a salad with red vinagariette, roasted red peppers, candied walnuts, golden raisens and gargonzola cheese. It wasn't memorable amongst all the bangin' dishes but not too shabby at all.\n\nFor the Fifth course (and when I finally tapped out) I ordered the Cioppino with shrimp, mussels, clams, scallops and fish in a saffron and tomato broth with sambuca. It matched all the other dishes. Just incredible. Loved the broth, loved the succulent scallop (just one, but I can't complain, I was stuffed by that point!), the shrimp was jumbo and the fish was perfectly cooked. And the garlic bread was excellent.\n\nWhenever anyone says things are expensive, I usually think they're talking $30 a plate. But, this place is legit expensive. Think $50 (ish) a plate. But what I can tell you is it was 100% worth it! We had leftovers for two days! Talk about an Italian hospitality. Which, by the way, the service was exceptional, but I would have expected that here. \n\nA perfect special night out, if you don't mind unbuckling a couple notches in front of your dining companion, of course!","Absolutely incredible restaurant! It is by far my favorite restaurant in the city. Everything about this place is fantastic especially their Veal Chop Milanese, the restaurant is pretty pricey but 100% well worth the money. I recommend this restaurant to anyone who is looking for a fantastic Italian meal.","This is my favorite place to eat!  The greens and beans, the meatball, and the hot cheese for appetizers are excellent.  I love the pasta with a dash of the oil they give you. The Alfredo in the cheese wheel is an excellent alternative to red sauce.   I've tried just about every dish there and never had a bad meal.  The Veal Chop is by far my favorite.  Huge portions which usually come home!! ;)\nThe atmosphere is a very quaint three story house, use valet parking, because the area is not the best! Lol but the police station is a cross the street. So it's all good!   \nThis is the perfect place for a great meal with great service for any function or just date night!","Possibly the best Italian Restaurant I've ever been too.  The Vodka Sauce was phenomenal.  I finished the evening with a  Fernet Branca.....perfection.","This is one of if not the best meals I have ever had.   I have only gone as part of work functions (about 3 different occasions) and every time we get the upstairs private room.  The service is fantastic.  I always have the Veal Chop Milanese which is AMAZING.  They also have a delicious pasta as an appetizer which has a little spice to it.  You will not find a better meal in Pittsburgh.  I have no idea what the prices actually are as I have never paid but it is definitely very pricey.  The neighborhood is real grimey but don't let that dissuade you from going there.","Their prices are exorbitant but so worth it. I've only had Italian this good in NY, LA, and Italy. No wonder there are pictures of celebrities all over the walls. What a hidden gem. $260 for two? Money well spent.","UPDATED: Just wanted to share that we attempted to visit for a third time when my husband's brother was in town in mid-November of 2014.  We had reservations for 7:30 on a Tuesday, so we obviously figured we would be seated immediately.  The brother and his girlfriend arrived a couple minutes before the reservation and were told to go up to the bar while they set the table and wait for the rest of the party.  I arrived about a minute after and my husband a few minutes behind me as he needed to park due to the lack of valet during the week.  There was no one at the host stand when either of us came in.  So we went up to the bar, declined a drink... and waited, and waited.  The bartender soon became deeply involved in picking a wine for a couple at the bar, not his fault.  The brother eventually was able to flag down a waitress to ask if she could check on our table.  She looked very annoyed.  She eventually went over to the phone at the bar, called down, hung up the phone and said, dead pan, \"no, it's not ready yet.\"  Not a smile, not a sorry, not a \"can we get you a drink on the house?\" Meanwhile, there was an open table for 4 on that floor.  The bartender eventually told us \"that's for a reservation.\" \"Yes, we have a reservation... for 25 minutes ago.\"  \"They must have specifically requested that table.\"  They did, however, offer us the table right next to the door on the first floor though - the one with the 10 degree breeze coming in that night.  No thank you.  We were very insulted by the lack of table for our reservation, but more so by the lack of acceptable service.  We decided to leave and spend $20 on pizza instead of $100+ per person and enjoyed much better service.. which is never the way it should be.  Hopefully they solve this problem soon.  We'll give it one more go when the insult has worn off.\n\nMy husband won't hesitate to tell you what his favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh is: Alla Famiglia.  And to be honest, these days I agree with him!  \n\nWhile my husband enjoys many of the more \"up and coming\" restaurants with smaller portions and interesting flavor combinations, he often finds himself longing for the same quality food with better cuts of meat and bigger portions.  This is where we satisfy both of our appetites for big flavor and, well, big portions.  But to reduce Alla Famiglia to those two things alone would not do it justice.\n\nLet's start out instead with addressing the two biggest critiques of this place: its location and the price.  Yes, it is in Allentown, but they also have plenty of parking and valet if you prefer.  Honestly, we drive almost everywhere to get dinner, so this is not an issue for us.  The other thing I always hear about is how expensive it is.  Some of those complaints come from people who I know have no problem giving their money to the big steakhouse chains, while getting a lot less value.  No, it is not cheap.  You will likely pay upwards of $50 for your entry.  The veal chops are close to $70.  But, that's not all you get.  You get delicious, fresh baked bread, a spread, dipping oil and gustoso for same, a delicious salad, and homemade pasta served family style.  If you wanted to be especially frugal, you could approach this place like an Olive Garden senior special: feast on the freebies and take your entree to go.  But, even if you're full, it may be too difficult not to savor the meal as it comes out...\n\nI've been here twice and my husband has been here three times (lucky - he got to go for work and he said they ordered almost every appetizer, all of which were apparently delicious).  The first time I ordered the filet with gorgonzola.  It was one of the most delicious and largest filets I've ever had.  My husband ordered a veal chop with prosciutto which I don't think I recognized on the current menu, but he absolutely loved it.  The veal chop is one of the largest bone-in cuts of meat I've seen and the sear on it was absolutely perfect.  We also ordered the mussels, which were spicy and delicious, and the meatball appetizer, which I remember being tasty, but nothing too out of the ordinary.  I think there are other things on the menu to try first. \n\nThe second time we came I ordered the Milanese veal chop, breaded, slightly citrusy, and absolutely heavenly.    He had the cowboy ribeye which was also large and an absolutely beautiful cut of meat.  The husband has a thing about fatty cuts and avoiding anything that is the least bit chewy, and he barely had to leave a piece on his plate.  We also got the calamari appetizer, which was perfectly, lightly fried with a savory, garlic sauce that sets it apart from the sweet sauces often served with calamari.\n\nFinally, I should note that the service we have received here has always been exceptional.  Everyone is always professional and courteous.","After a friend told me about her wonderful experience here, I knew I had to go. I also knew that it wasn't really in my budget. Well, lucky for me an old college friend of mine decided that he was coming to town for a visit. I sent him the websites for various restaurants and when he saw Alla Famiglia he said, \"Oh honey. Make the reservation - I've got it.\"  YES! I knew I kept him around for some reason!\n\nSo on a cold, snowy Saturday night, we trudged up the mountain. And it was glorious.\n\nFirst off, it IS in a bit of a sketchy neighborhood. But no worries - they have valet, so you don't have to deal with trying to find somewhere to park and walking around.\n\nThe Holy Oil is the best thing I've ever dipped bread into - and I'm a dipper. I come from an Italian family - we dip everything into everything - bread into sauce, cookies into coffee, bread into coffee, etc. This is by far the best dipping experience I've ever had.\n\nOnto the MEATBALL. We got the mozzarella-stuffed meatball for our appetizer. The meatball was good. The sauce was great. There isn't much more I can say about it, to be honest. It was just so, so yummy.\n\nSalad course: Great salad!\n\nPasta course: So, I was slightly disappointed that they did not give us a choice. I was really looking forward to the fettuccine in the cheese wheel that I had read about here! Alas, only vodka sauce. Great vodka sauce, though. I should've asked about that damn cheese wheel...\n\nFor the main course, I got the veal chop milanese and it was perfect. My friend got the cioppino and he enjoyed that very much.\n\nI could not even think about eating dessert. We had so much food. I took 1/2 of my pasta course and 3/4 of my main course home. I really wish I had gotten a dessert to go and eaten it later, though. \n\nI really cannot wait to go again.","I was in Pittsburgh my home town for a recent stay.  Alla Famiglia is the best restaurant I have been to in the Burgh.  It was consistent with the type of upscale dining I have gotten used to in Boston and I was pleasantly surprised.  The area surrounding the restaurant does not seem to be the safest locale, but worth going there for a wonderful dinner.  The service was exceptional!  The food was amazing with cheese plates, bread and side for the bread basket, meatball appetizer, cowboy steak with gorgonzola, and the halibut.  The tiramisu was the best I have had.  The addition of BYOB was a hidden gem as well.  I would highly recommend this for a special night out to celebrate.  Fantastic restaurant.","Simply outstanding...we had a large group (11) and everything was perfect. Several comments that this was the best Italian cuisine several of our group had experienced anywhere in the world.  Can't wait to go back!\n\nThe famous Meatball app did not disappoint (my fav was the stuffed peppers) and the many preparations of veal (main courses) were all exquisite.  \n\nAbsolutely recommend for any and all who are considering this fantastic establishment!","Just recently returned. PHENOMENAL meal! Glenn our waiter was superb. Loved the veal dishes.  I also enjoyed the new cocktail menu. One of the drinks was iced coffee with orangicello and frangelica cream. DELICIOUS!","This restaurant was phenomenal.   We went for my wife's 30th birthday with a large group of people and it was a great experience.  \n\nThe meatball and fried cheese appetizers were really good.  The marinara that came with the meatball was the best I have ever had.\n\nDon't go here if you are in a rush, because the entire dining experience will take several hours.  But we were there to enjoy the night, so we did not care.\n\nI would definitely recommend this to anyone as long as you are willing to spend the money.  If you do  appetizers, drinks and dinner it will run about $100 a person.  But I thought it was well worth it.\n\nThe wait staff was great.  Our server was Emmett and we had a lot of fun with him.  The owner/chef even came out and chatted with us on the upstairs outdoor patio.","My favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. Always delicious and I always order a different entree. The accompaniments to the meal are perfect. Every. Single. Time.

waiter was to be found about ten minutes later they gave us our water and left again! It wasn't even busy! There were only TWO dim sum carts floating around somewhere. Then our waiter finally came around and took our orders of lunch entrees. The food was not even that good as the reviews that are posted on here. When we came up to pay, the bill was super overpriced. I will not be returning here, I am better off eating at Great Wall Cuisine.","If this place had zero stars I would have given them that ! Let me start off by saying I was so excited to read all great reviews so maybe I just came in on a off day? We walked in and were seated came over and asked if we wanted water or tea I guess they don't serve anything Else, Then we placed an order pork dumplings and sticky rice nasty! Then I asked if they served egg rolls they said they were out!!! they pushed their little carts around with hot plates that basically steam the food and is not fresh and what you get is soggy poor customer service we had to get up and look for someone to give us our tab so we could get the heck out of there are get some real food. It looked like it would be a great place for groups of people would not recommend if you are on mission for what you want and want to place an order but it could be a fun experience for some people.","You walk into a Chinese restaurant on a Saturday afternoon for dim sum and you expect the place to be PACKED.  Well, walking in to a pretty much empty dining room, it's a VERY CLEAR SIGN.  But my friend insisted and I was very hesitant for good reasons.  Another indicator, the majority of the patrons were NON Asian.  \n\nFood: You walk in and you see carts of the food by the entrance to the dining room.  Umm, I thought dim sum should come right off the steamer and into the carts and they roll it around, not sitting around.  The dim sum was garbage.  It had the typical selection, but at minimum.  \n\nService: It's ok.  But it doesn't make up for the horrible food.\n\nBottom line: NO WAY!  Stay away!","I've been here many times...Mother's Day with family, dim sum with book club, etc. But I will not go back again.  I stopped in to ask the owner about a donation or reduced price for a class of under-privileged kids that I volunteer with.  His reaction was to scoff and shoo me out the door while handing me his card and saying I could email him.  He turned his back and headed off to the messy newspaper-strewn table he haunts between guests arrivals.  Maybe he's a community-minded business owner, but then again, maybe he's not.  I'll be dining elsewhere.","Being from Chicago, we are used to getting authentic Chinese food all the time.  But when we first starting spending a lot of time in Scottsdale/Phoenix, we found it a challenge to get authentic Chinese food.  We were excited to find the Golden Buddha and have made many trips over the years all the way from the Troon North area to get our fix.  However, service has declined to the point where it is no longer worth the aggravation.  We went there last night for Chinese New Year and will never go back.  Granted they were very busy because of a lot of large tables there, but waiting almost an hour to get our food is not acceptable under any circumstance!  45 mins. into our wait, the waitress came back (after we flagged her down to ask about our food) and said one of the dishes we ordered was not available....after 45 mins.!!!! What makes the whole experience an unforgivable one is that the manager/owner is so indifferent and never apologized or offered a discount off the bill...nothing.  When we left, the same manager was at the piano singing in Chinese. Huh?  Other than Nee House in Scottsdale, the search goes on for a restaurant that serves authentic Chinese food closer to home.","I will NEVER go there again.  I reserved a table for a group of 16 people for 5:00 PM on Christmas Eve .  The person on the phone ( I believe the manager) repeatedly asked me to call ahead and give him an accurate head count since he said they'd be swamped that day.  I followed up with him twice.  \nWhen the first couple of us arrived, we had menus shoved in our faces immediately and told we \"Must order now.  Must order now\" because they were going to be busy later on.  The place was practically empty.  As each person arrived, they were treated the same way. \nWe rushed and placed our orders and then they brought out our checks WAY before we saw any sign of our food.  I have never in my life been treated so rudely by a restaurant.\nIt was utter chaos when the food started coming out while everyone struggled to get the correct dish they ordered.  One person didn't get her food until we were all just about finished eating. \nOne top of all that, the food wasn't even good.  I've had better Kung Pao Chicken at Panda Express!\nAfter being rushed through our meal, the place wasn't even half full by the time we left.  I thought being at the Cultural Center, this restaurant would be a sure thing but boy was I wrong.  Lovely way to spend Christmas Eve..","If you are looking a chinese restaurant to host a big party look some other than the Golden Buddah.  I recently attended a banquet at the Golden Buddah and I was shocked at the level of quality of food and service.  Of the 10 dishes served 4 were nearly inedible.  \n\nThere was a crab claw appetizer, most chinese restaurants prepare this dish by taking a crab claw surrounding it with ground shrimp, batter and then deep fry.  At Golden Buddah, the crab claw served was mostly batter.  \n\nThe shark fin soup served was mostly broth.  Shark fin is an expensive ingredient and most places usually use imitation shark fin, but come on at least put something in there so that I know I'm eating soup and not dirty sink water.  \n\nGinger scallion lobster is battered, fried, and then stir fried in a sauce with ginger and scallions.  The ginger scallion lobster served was over-cooked and dried out.  \n\nLastly, there was a steamed fish.  The fish was raw in the middle.   \n\nIt wasn't all bad, there was a crispy chicken with garlic dish that was pretty good, but out of 10 dishes 4 were bad, 5 were okay, and 1 was good.  \n\nDoes 4 bad dishes out of 10 warrant a one star rating?  Well it does when you factor in the service.  The soup, appetizer, and first entree arrived timely, but after that there was a 1 hour gap before we received the next dish.  The dishes were not served with accompanying white rice which I thought was odd.  We had to ask for it, and even the rice took a while to arrive.","I agree with Crystal C., that the dim sum isn't the greatest I've ever had. In fact, I am not sure if the meal was so tasty that it was memorable. I do remember the \"calamari\" was not really calamari, like you would think. It was presented more like a sweet and sour pork (so calamari with LOTS of breading) without any sauce. As a result, the dish was dry and salty.\n\nThe sticky rice was good (hard to mess up), the chicken feet were okay (needed more five spice powder), and the shumai was alright. The noodles were good, and I can see why the cart ran out after the first round. The diners were an equal mix of Asians and Americans. I would've preferred to see more Asians eating (as I am used to in a Chinatown and gives an indication of authenticity), but I do realize we're in Phoenix where the Asian population is not like San Francisco or Houston. \n\nThe meal came to about $30 for two, including jasmine tea. The carts are loud because they are made out of metal and roll on tile. I am also not used to staff members shouting what they have in their cart, like a newspaper boy yelling \"Extra! Extra!\" Christmas music was playing after mid-January, so the atmosphere felt strange. Next time I visit the city, I probably will pass.","Can't say that I was very impressed. Came for dinner in a hopeful and enthusiastic mood since the reviews have been pretty good, but I don't think this place lives up to its current good, but declining rating.\n\nOrdered the Combo fried rice (shrimp, chicken, beef, pork), sesame chicken, and garlic fried chicken. \n\nThe combo fried rice was pretty good, but ended up drinking about 6 glasses of water due to the MSG and sodium content. You'd think that the cook spent his better years in the French Foreign Legion in the Sahara eating salt tablets and developed a taste for them. \n\nThe sesame chicken had a good flavor and a thick brown sweet sauce. I liked it a lot until it got cool and the sauce looked (with that stringy consistency) more like glue. You think I'm kidding? I'm not.\n\nGarlic fried chicken was bad. Just bad. It was like an over roasted dried out half chicken with some dried garlic pieces sprinkled on top. No spices, no flavor, no good. \n\nWe then got all kinds of lip from the waitress when we asked if they could change the channel on the TV from college football, to the Suns game. They made it into this big deal that the \"customers\" wanted to see the football game. Yeah right, it was University of West Virginia Vs. University of Connecticut! I would have believed it if it was a local team....\n\nIt's better than a 1 star joint, but only because it's borderline edible. To be avoided.","This restaurant is located in the Chinese Cultural Center and was the one restaurant that I had not been to. So after some shopping at one of the shops, we stepped in to have dinner.\n\nWe stepped in and asked for a seat for two. We were seated immediately. The place was decorated nicely and a lady playing the piano made for great ambiance.\n\nWe looked at the menu briefly and ordered our drinks, an appetizer, a soup and two main dishes. The drinks came out promptly and so did the rest of the meal. My goodness everything we ordered was very tasty.\n\nThe waiter service itself however was not even close to the decor and food. He never introduced himself, and although he took our order, our food itself was brought out by a kitchen person.\n\nAfter we ordered our waiter really never came back asking if we needed anything else, except to give us our check at the end and that was after the person I was dining with got up and asked a different waiter for it.\n\nIt's amazing how a place with great food, decor, and ambiance can mess it all up by crappy waiter service.","I love Dim Sum, my favorite Chinese dish.\n\nWhen Golden Buddha first open, they have excellent Dim sum. I went there many times, I tell my friend how good it is, But now,  they change cook, taste more like  week old left over. Rumor has it, they change cook every few month, so Quality of cooking change. (not sure if that is true, but that is what I was told.)\nMy advice is; when you walk in the door and the place is pack, = Good Cook. if the place is bare = bad cook. leave immediately. don't waste your money.","If you just \"want\" dim sum, go here. If you are \"craving\" dim sum, go elsewhere (take a 5 hour drive west to neighboring state, California).\n\nAnyway, I've been visiting Golden Buddha in the noontime for roughly 2 years now. I believe they moved from their original site (7th St. & Osborn), formerly \"China Doll.\" Relocation brought along better atmosphere and smiling faces. This does not mean, better dim sum. But since we are in Phoenix, I will settle for what they have to offer. \n\nBe mindful of the dim sum tab. It's itemized high-medium-low. \n\nShaomai can be found as combinations of pork/mushroom, shrimp, or shark fin (which should not be confused as true shark bits, as the shaomai is prepared to look like a shark's fin). These picks are okay...perhaps on a better day shao mai will be served in less-rigid, or fresher wrappers. Potstickers are okay as well, just the usual scallion and pork, and dry wrapper. The baby pork ribs in light black bean sauce and jalapenos is alright, but sometimes lacks in taste. Tripe is also served in its bare minimum...so if you enjoy the texture and flavor of tripe, try this with its clear sauce and thinly sliced carrots and celery.  \nBuche (that's what I call it), or fried sesame balls are also available, although if you wait until dessert, they will also be a bit stiff. There are a few other things that may be \"spotted\" but are not worth mentioning. \n\nDon't order from their lunch menu, as you can find these over-salted dishes at Panda Express anyway. \n\nOverall, dim sum at Golden Buddha is a place to go if you are around the vicinity and feel like having something apart from the usual fast food. However, discriminating palates- beware.","Not impressed with this place at all. This was not the friendliest place around, maybe because of the language barrier (most or all were clearly native Chinese speakers), or maybe just the attitude of the employees.\n\nI ordered the sweet and sour chicken lunch, which came with the typical egg drop soup, crab rangoon, and egg roll. The soup was ok - maybe it's just me, but I prefer a real spoon to the scoop that they gave me. The egg roll was tiny and not that great, and the crab rangoon was ok, but maybe a little undercooked. The chicken wasn't bad, but nothing special, as was the rice and other stuff on the plate.\n\nOverall, this was just not my kind of Chinese place.","Disappointing.  Mediocre at best.  I am staying at the Aloft hotel in phoenix and ordered some delivery. I ordered a couple american chinese food staples: general tso's chicken, dumplings and hot&sour soup.  Soup had zero flavor, dumplings tasted freezer burned and processed.  General tso chicken was ehh. \n\nA lot of good reviews on here so it must be for eat in and for their dim sum.  Don't order delivery, you will be left hungry and unsatisfied.","Went there on Saturday for early lunch.  My wife did the dim sum, it was okay, we were both disgusted by the sugar cane shrimp; but the rest was good.  \n\nI ordered the chicken szechwuan, the waitress warned me it was \"spicy\" the reason I ordered it.  It came out delicious, but not what I would call spicy.  Overall its hard to find good Chinese in the valley and I would call this good without hesitation.","So I was referred to this place from the front desk of my hotel. I'm from SF so I'm coming from a place with really good chinese food. \n\nThe dim sum is just \"ok\" nothing for me to write home about. The one dish that I really liked was the chinese broccoli cooked with garlic sauce. Yum yum yum.  It's in a big bowl, not oily, not saucy, just really good. I think it's $7.50.  \n\nIt's a somewhat pricey and just like all chinese restaurants, it's not the cleanest.  The chair was filthy.  the dishes weren't all that great.  I wouldn't go back unless I want the chinese broccoli.  \n\nSo I went on a Sunday and it was not crowded at all. There's not a huge asian population  in Phoenix (not that I could tell) so I don't think there's a high demand for dim sum.  And also, I sooooooo felt like taking a pic of this, but a Mexican lady was pushing one of the dim sum carts. That is unheard of in SF.  This is a mainly mandarin restaurant and the dim sum places I go are usually cantonese.  Not a big deal though since the dishes look the same. \n\nDude, there was a turtle in the fish tank that I saw as I left.  I hope they don't eat that!","A Premier Chinese Atmosphere,\nThe Chinese cultural center and Asian Garden produces an Asain atmosphere that can be recognized from the 202.  \n With Dim Sum served this location earns its respect from the local community.\n\nDim Sum tip,  You have to be smart with the Dim Sum ladies they look nice innocent but they are professional sales people that will sell you more dishes than you need before you know what to do.  \n\nI love the desserts here ask the server to see the dessert tray.","This restaurant has a bit of an identity crisis. It is in the Chinese cultural center, but serves Japanese beer (Kirin on tap!) and the live piano music is American pop. We had to ask for chopsticks.\n\nHaving said that, the service was professional. Our waiter held a hot appetizer for one of our party who was away from the table so that it would not be cold when he returned. We were asked frequently--and not too frequently--if things were ok both by our waiter and the manager/proprietor.\n\nThe food was ok-to-good. Fried shrimp egg rolls were dainty but yummy. Duck was tasty but very chewy. Kung-pao chicken was pleasantly spiced. Plenty of rice. A pitcher of ice water with lemon was left at the table. \n\nAtmosphere was also pleasant. Chairs comfortable, tables spaced well, restrooms large and clean...and there is indeed a large golden Buddha by the entrance.","I took a group of friends here and relatives other times. The place is consistently good for Dim-sum during lunch. It is typical Chinese and nothing fancy.\n\nWhat helps this place is the moat scenery.  3 stars for visiting here based on convenience since there are similar places in town.","Having grown up in Hong Kong and having eaten dim sum in London, NY, LA, SF and Vancouver (actually Richmond), I can confidently say I know my dim sum.\n\nGood selection of well-executed dim sum when the carts actually come around and there's anything left in it.  I'd give it 4 stars for food but the wait definitely detracted from the whole experience.\n\nI think the problem with Golden Buddha is that they can't handle the heavy flow on weekends.  There's not enough regular dim sum eaters like LA that can sustain a steady flow of diners throughout the week, forcing restaurants like Golden Buddha to depend heavily on extra part-time help on weekends.  \n\nDim sum takes serious skill so the chef still ends up doing most of the work.  When we looked into the kitchen, we saw a Chinese woman doing most of the cooking herself.  No wonder it took forever for a cart to come out and when it does, it's swarmed on by a pack of vultures.\n\nIf you're willing to eat at a more simply decorated place with a smaller menu, I'd highly recommend China Chan.  It's much more relaxed - usually no wait on weekends.  An experienced chef makes all the dim sum himself so the menu's much shorter but all the classics are on it.  Anything steamed is made to order so is very fresh.","Situated in the Chinese Cultural Center near the SkyHarbor Airport, this was another pleasant find. All I had was the Dim Sum menu, and I would say this is the best you're gonna get in Phoenix. Still worth the stop to get your Dim Sum fix. The cart ladies were pleasant and very happy to converse with me in Cantonese. Only downside was the chicken sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaves, naw mei gai, was way overcooked, and mushy.","Do you want to eat Chinese Food in an elegant environment on a Friday night in Phoenix? \n\nBe entertained by classic, quiet standards being played live on a piano while you dine?\n\nAre you 50 years old and Caucasian?\n\nThen the Golden Buddha is the place for you! \n\nIts in the Chinese Cultural Center Mall on 44th, and a popular weekend spot for Dim Sum. For a DIm Sum starved Valley of the Sun, Golden Buddha's is decent. \n\nFor dinner, though, it is awfully Americanized and not very authentic Chinese. But with a bunch of American customers coming for dinner, what do you expect? They probably think they are getting \"real Chinese\" food by going to the Chinese Mall, but then again, they are used to PF Chang's or Stix normally in their neighborhood, so this is a step up.\n\nThe best thing about this place is the decor, which is clean and nice, with a Hong Kong Junk boat design covering the ceiling from the bar into the dining room. The next best thing is the Piano interludes on weekend nights. The service is next, which is a little overly eager to remove your plate, and the last thing is the food. \n\nThey do give decent portions. I ordered Guo Teh (potstickers) and got 6 fat ones. But they weren't served with the usual soy, chili oil and vinegar, but a soy and green onions mixture. The Mapo Tofu was ok, as they used a nice silky tofu, which was nice, but no green onions, and sliced black mushrooms instead, which I like, but not in this dish.\n\nCome here for the ambiance and music in the evenings, or on the weekend days for Dim Sum.","Decent dim sum, especially to be found in the middle of the desert. Sadly, the best food I've had in Phoenix.","This place is a little difficult for me to review.  I was staying at the Hampton Inn across the street and this is the closest restaurant so off I went.\n\nI walked in and the owner or manager met me at the door and asked \"how many\"?\n\nI told him I wanted to order take out and handed me a menu and pointed to the waiting area which was covered in newspapers.  I chose to go to the bar, order a glass of wine, and peruse the menu.\n\nThe drinks are expensive but I didn't think the food was.  Less than $10 for my Mongolian Chicken which came with white sticky rice and a fortune cookie.  When ordering I asked if I could have fried rice instead of white rice but was told \"no\".  Most places allow this for a nominal fee.\n\nFine by me.  Give the white rice.  Food was prepared and their to-go boxes were a lot better than the standard white Chinese \"to go\" boxes.  They also included the plastic-ware, napkin, and soy sauce, which a lot of places forget.\n\nLooking around I found a whole lot of goodness along with a couple disappointments.  Most notably the newspaper strewn about and behind the bar, to the right were a lot of boxes stacked in an unsightly fashion.  I could have been a little more presentable in my opinion.\n\nI peeked into the dining room because I wanted to see if the piano music was piped in or live.  It was live which was very nice. Also, the dinning room looked very nice and cozy.\n\nAs I was leaving the same man who greeted me upon entering made sure to wish me a good evening.  My initial impression of the man was that he was surly and testy but that's just how he comes off.\n\nThe food was very good.  The Mongolian sauce was mixture of sweet with spice and the chicken and vegetables all tasted fresh.","My husband and I went there Saturday, the service was great!  Our friends were going to be late so they told us to start.  And start we did!\nThey were serving Dim Sum, something we had never tried, so glad we did, it was wonderful, hubby wouldn't do the chicken feet, but I think next time I will, it looked very good.\nOur friends showed up and ordered their food, and ate all of it, they said that usually they take food home, but it was so good they had to eat all of it!\nWe will be going back very soon!","Let's see, over 50... check \nold white man...........check \neats dinner ...............check \nlistens to the piano  check \n\nwow this must be the place for me, I mean after all it is in a Chinese mall, no make that a Chinese Cultural Center. How could I possibly have discerning taste with such trickery to get me here to eat. \nDude if you are going to rate a restaurant no need to degrade others with your arrogance. \nFool is my review of wanugee N. \n\nNow on the restaurant. The last time we were here the food was not good, the piano was too loud and the waitress had a real attitude. IT won't keep me from going back as I have had good meals and wait service too. \n\nBack to wanugee N. I do not expect any place in Phx. to have authentic Chinese food, by that I mean the street food one finds in China. \nBut I do expect what I fork in to my mouth is worth what I am going to fork over in cost. Even an old white guy like me can tell the difference between good and bad food. No matter what it is called.","Okay so Ive been glum the past few days as I have an impending birthday. Every year this time I get all down in the dumps.. not that I'm not happy with my life cause life is good. Its more like getting further away from my youth and closer to being well, old. All of my grandparents were crotchety, sourpuss drama queens.. is that my fate? Can I break the mold or am I to going to be a crotchety sourpuss?\n\nSo as I contemplate and figure out what I'm going to do with my birthday baggage I decide to squash it with food. All weekend Ive been eating out and having a good time. This is one of the few times outside of a vacation where I will live it completely and to the near of sheer gluttony. So why not dim sum? \n\nIve chowed much dim sum in my 36 years of earthen wear.. of course some good and some bad. I have never been to a place where every dish was great.. Golden Buddha is no exception to this.. they do the basics well enough and have enough funky cool Asian style to keep me interested in returning. The carts around 1130 flow well but around noon it' s full blown freeway action! In fact there might be some road kill in there based on some of the looks on that last steam cart.. \n\nMe and 3 others who were feeling my pain ordered 14, count them, 14 different dishes. One of my friends is from Georgia and had never had dim sum but he is so courageous and unflinching that he was just a blast. Just the shot in the arm to get me out of my funk. I remember the first time I had dim sum.. my eyes wide open, nostrils flared and excited to see what was under the next steamer lid. That was him today.. one exciting thing after the next.. he was even willing to try chicken feet but this is one of those dishes not done very well here. \n\nMy friend took me back to a time where I was younger and less experienced. He looked up to me to guide him through the noodles, bao and sui mai.. like a big brother.. I'm privileged that I could show him something new and exciting and he was so into it! So instead of feeling sorry for myself I felt experienced and useful.. that there is something I can give back to others.. that its not all about me and me aging but about what can be shared with others.\n\nThere is so much more to do, give and feel in this short time we are here.. and Ill do it to, one bite at a time.","The best to be found in land locked Arizona.  My favorite sticky rice is here.  They have dim sum every day, but not a huge selection, though you can order off the menu.  I think it is much bigger on the weekends.  I'm just happy I can get my fix 7 days a week.  Beautiful gardens to walk through, with fish ponds, and a 99 market next door!","I ate at Golden Buddha a few weeks ago.  We ate at the restaurant after a day at the zoo with our 4 year old and had a blast.  The piano bar played tunes for my daughter and the staff was more than accommodating.  The general tso chicken was better than anything I can get in Tucson.  The soup was chocked full of fresh, read FRESH, not canned, vegetables.  All in all, I was very satisfied with the meal and the service.  Plus the decor is very nice, clean and cheery. \n\nEat at Golden Buddha.","For those who gave this place low marks, forgive me. I really like this place. Now I haven't tried various dim sum places so I'm reserving the right to downgrade the place as needed. The variety of food is plentiful, and the carts just keep on coming. I love the steamed pork buns, and the shiu mai (not sure if I spelled that correctly). Yesterday, my favorite pick was the deep fried rolls of taro and shrimp. YUM! I have never ordered from their menu so I can only talk about their dim sum. My friends and I try to go eat dim sum almost every Sunday. It's a cheap way to try new foods, and if you don't like it, well.. you can get away with pushing it aside with minimal guilt. Give it a try! You might be surprised.","I like Golden Buddha, have taken many friends there for Dim Sum.  \nTry not to \"hit\" the dumpling cart to heavy; otherwise cannot finish it to the dessert cart (LOL).\nLove the jasmine tea and the staff willing to help you if you do not understand the what each item is.\nSingapore Rice Noodles a favorite, along with any of the shrimp dumplings; also the broccoli and green beans.\nOnly wish that the carts with eggplant stuffed with shrimp or green peppers with shrimp were not on \"heated\" carts; by the time it gets to you the food is cold.\nOnly concern is that went on 22MAY2010 at 1:30PM; there was a closed sign due to electricity???\nREVISED: 26MAY2010 - called this evening - looks like they are back open again.","I've been to the Golden Buddha on several occasions and it is my favorite, by far, for honest Chinese food. \nWhile I've sampled everything from their vegetarian to their beef, I love their mandarin chicken. More recently, I was delighted to relive the wonders of their Kung Pao Chicken and Beef with Broccoli. \nI absolutely love the egg drop soup and mini crab rangoons that come with the meal.","The very first time I went to Golden Buddha was with my BFF and it was our first dim sum experience. Little did I know this would forever change my life and eating experiences. Although I must admit that first time was a bit awkward.\n\nGB wisely takes reservations which was wonderful (even though it wasn't crazy busy). Our assorted dim sum plates were flavorful and fresh. And the carts seemed to be in constant rotation so we were never too far from a good selection.\n\nWhat really helps GB is its location. The Cofco Center is an experience in itself, where one can have herbs specially blended, select a fresh member of marine life to take home and cook or browse through a store with one of the largest selections of Buddhas and hand fans I've experienced outside of San Francisco.","I've been to Golden Buddha a few times and have not been disappointed. \n\nThey have a LARGE selection of Dim Sum and if you're not careful you can get carried away.\n\nTry and get there early and you'll get the best and most fresh selection.\nMake sure you walk around the garden when you're done.","Probably the most comprehensive Chinese menu in the Valley.  Pick from well over 100 dishes, but if you want the best order the Peking Duck.  Everything else is very good, but without a wow factor.  You'll see lots of Chinese people in this massive restaurant, which probably means they're doing a fine job in the kitchen.","I very much enjoyed eating here. Food was great. Fairly fast service. Wasn't expensive either for the 4 of us.","Golden Buddha has GREAT dim sum.  Their prices are reasonable and the staff is very polite wheeling their little carts.  I tend to go on the weekend because there is more selection but they do dim sum throughout the week.  They also have some very authentic dishes on the menu for those who are more of the adventurous types.  Be sure to say hello to the turtles the next time you go.","This place in the Chinese Cultural Center has a very pretty and elegant bar area. I was pleased to learn that they had some very reasonable and delicious happy hour snacks. This is a good place for a Pina Colada. I had one by myself along with some dumplings and fried shrimp appetizer. Sadly I never brought anyone else here with me. It was happy hour heaven but you know? A lot of my friends in AZ pretty much hang out in one neighborhood or another and nobody I know really lives close to the Buddha.\nThe airport is pretty close by. This might be a good pre-flight send-off location.","I have had dim sum in New Orleans and Phoenix (not SF), and this is about equal to the best of New Orleans as far as flavor.\nAs for ambiance, today was a good day. I've had dim sum here about a dozen times, and have had very good service and quality 90% of the time, including weekends. I have had bad days here, but since today was good, I'll rate accordingly. It's closer to a 4.5, but since I can't give half-stars, I rounded up.\nDon't expect me to give these the right names, but... I was less than impressed with the bbq pork balls. They tasted too much like honey and the beef was minimal. The bbq sauce tasted bottled. Outside of that, their herbal hot tea is delicious even on a hot day.\nThe shu mai were very good, and the shrimp in a spinach dumpling was fantastic. A definite don't miss is their sticky rice in lotus leaf. It's among the best I've had anywhere. Just be careful; you'll find bones in it every once in a while. Go for any of their steamed dumplings; they're very flavorful. As others have said, I love the Chinese broccoli, but you'll only find it on the carts on weekends. Otherwise order it off the menu.\nToday (11:30 lunch) the carts came around often, and everything except the pork buns was piping hot and fresh. By the way, despite the price increases, even the sticky rice was considered a medium size entree, and the two of us eating there escaped with a bill under $20 and we were done in under 30 minutes.\nI strongly recommend the dim sum here, whether you've had it a million times or have never had it before. You usually won't be disappointed.","I don't really understand the poor reviews on this place.....maybe it depends on the day you go? We went on a Sunday, it was crazy busy, but service was great! (of course, my view of customer service is a little different then the rest... I used to live on an island where you were just happy to find what you were looking for, let alone expect good customer service) Anyways, our server was very sweet! Always had a smile on her face. The carts served us promplty and none of the food was cold. They always had whatever we wanted (I hate having to wait for the next cart).\n\nNow, as for the actual dim sum and food.......holy cow, to die for! So flavorful and fresh!! The broccoli makes you sing...and the wine noodles, make you cry. You leave with very weird mixed emotions, but mostly a happy belly full of yummy food.\n\nIn my opinion, this is the best dim sum I have been able to find in Phx. I'm ditching my previous spot (Mekong Palace) and will be back to Golden Buddha when the dim sum monster strikes again!"],"type":["Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low

waiter was to be found about ten minutes later they gave us our water and left again! It wasn't even busy! There were only TWO dim sum carts floating around somewhere. Then our waiter finally came around and took our orders of lunch entrees. The food was not even that good as the reviews that are posted on here. When we came up to pay, the bill was super overpriced. I will not be returning here, I am better off eating at Great Wall Cuisine.","If this place had zero stars I would have given them that ! Let me start off by saying I was so excited to read all great reviews so maybe I just came in on a off day? We walked in and were seated came over and asked if we wanted water or tea I guess they don't serve anything Else, Then we placed an order pork dumplings and sticky rice nasty! Then I asked if they served egg rolls they said they were out!!! they pushed their little carts around with hot plates that basically steam the food and is not fresh and what you get is soggy poor customer service we had to get up and look for someone to give us our tab so we could get the heck out of there are get some real food. It looked like it would be a great place for groups of people would not recommend if you are on mission for what you want and want to place an order but it could be a fun experience for some people.","You walk into a Chinese restaurant on a Saturday afternoon for dim sum and you expect the place to be PACKED.  Well, walking in to a pretty much empty dining room, it's a VERY CLEAR SIGN.  But my friend insisted and I was very hesitant for good reasons.  Another indicator, the majority of the patrons were NON Asian.  \n\nFood: You walk in and you see carts of the food by the entrance to the dining room.  Umm, I thought dim sum should come right off the steamer and into the carts and they roll it around, not sitting around.  The dim sum was garbage.  It had the typical selection, but at minimum.  \n\nService: It's ok.  But it doesn't make up for the horrible food.\n\nBottom line: NO WAY!  Stay away!","I've been here many times...Mother's Day with family, dim sum with book club, etc. But I will not go back again.  I stopped in to ask the owner about a donation or reduced price for a class of under-privileged kids that I volunteer with.  His reaction was to scoff and shoo me out the door while handing me his card and saying I could email him.  He turned his back and headed off to the messy newspaper-strewn table he haunts between guests arrivals.  Maybe he's a community-minded business owner, but then again, maybe he's not.  I'll be dining elsewhere.","Being from Chicago, we are used to getting authentic Chinese food all the time.  But when we first starting spending a lot of time in Scottsdale/Phoenix, we found it a challenge to get authentic Chinese food.  We were excited to find the Golden Buddha and have made many trips over the years all the way from the Troon North area to get our fix.  However, service has declined to the point where it is no longer worth the aggravation.  We went there last night for Chinese New Year and will never go back.  Granted they were very busy because of a lot of large tables there, but waiting almost an hour to get our food is not acceptable under any circumstance!  45 mins. into our wait, the waitress came back (after we flagged her down to ask about our food) and said one of the dishes we ordered was not available....after 45 mins.!!!! What makes the whole experience an unforgivable one is that the manager/owner is so indifferent and never apologized or offered a discount off the bill...nothing.  When we left, the same manager was at the piano singing in Chinese. Huh?  Other than Nee House in Scottsdale, the search goes on for a restaurant that serves authentic Chinese food closer to home.","I will NEVER go there again.  I reserved a table for a group of 16 people for 5:00 PM on Christmas Eve .  The person on the phone ( I believe the manager) repeatedly asked me to call ahead and give him an accurate head count since he said they'd be swamped that day.  I followed up with him twice.  \nWhen the first couple of us arrived, we had menus shoved in our faces immediately and told we \"Must order now.  Must order now\" because they were going to be busy later on.  The place was practically empty.  As each person arrived, they were treated the same way. \nWe rushed and placed our orders and then they brought out our checks WAY before we saw any sign of our food.  I have never in my life been treated so rudely by a restaurant.\nIt was utter chaos when the food started coming out while everyone struggled to get the correct dish they ordered.  One person didn't get her food until we were all just about finished eating. \nOne top of all that, the food wasn't even good.  I've had better Kung Pao Chicken at Panda Express!\nAfter being rushed through our meal, the place wasn't even half full by the time we left.  I thought being at the Cultural Center, this restaurant would be a sure thing but boy was I wrong.  Lovely way to spend Christmas Eve..","If you are looking a chinese restaurant to host a big party look some other than the Golden Buddah.  I recently attended a banquet at the Golden Buddah and I was shocked at the level of quality of food and service.  Of the 10 dishes served 4 were nearly inedible.  \n\nThere was a crab claw appetizer, most chinese restaurants prepare this dish by taking a crab claw surrounding it with ground shrimp, batter and then deep fry.  At Golden Buddah, the crab claw served was mostly batter.  \n\nThe shark fin soup served was mostly broth.  Shark fin is an expensive ingredient and most places usually use imitation shark fin, but come on at least put something in there so that I know I'm eating soup and not dirty sink water.  \n\nGinger scallion lobster is battered, fried, and then stir fried in a sauce with ginger and scallions.  The ginger scallion lobster served was over-cooked and dried out.  \n\nLastly, there was a steamed fish.  The fish was raw in the middle.   \n\nIt wasn't all bad, there was a crispy chicken with garlic dish that was pretty good, but out of 10 dishes 4 were bad, 5 were okay, and 1 was good.  \n\nDoes 4 bad dishes out of 10 warrant a one star rating?  Well it does when you factor in the service.  The soup, appetizer, and first entree arrived timely, but after that there was a 1 hour gap before we received the next dish.  The dishes were not served with accompanying white rice which I thought was odd.  We had to ask for it, and even the rice took a while to arrive.","I agree with Crystal C., that the dim sum isn't the greatest I've ever had. In fact, I am not sure if the meal was so tasty that it was memorable. I do remember the \"calamari\" was not really calamari, like you would think. It was presented more like a sweet and sour pork (so calamari with LOTS of breading) without any sauce. As a result, the dish was dry and salty.\n\nThe sticky rice was good (hard to mess up), the chicken feet were okay (needed more five spice powder), and the shumai was alright. The noodles were good, and I can see why the cart ran out after the first round. The diners were an equal mix of Asians and Americans. I would've preferred to see more Asians eating (as I am used to in a Chinatown and gives an indication of authenticity), but I do realize we're in Phoenix where the Asian population is not like San Francisco or Houston. \n\nThe meal came to about $30 for two, including jasmine tea. The carts are loud because they are made out of metal and roll on tile. I am also not used to staff members shouting what they have in their cart, like a newspaper boy yelling \"Extra! Extra!\" Christmas music was playing after mid-January, so the atmosphere felt strange. Next time I visit the city, I probably will pass.","Can't say that I was very impressed. Came for dinner in a hopeful and enthusiastic mood since the reviews have been pretty good, but I don't think this place lives up to its current good, but declining rating.\n\nOrdered the Combo fried rice (shrimp, chicken, beef, pork), sesame chicken, and garlic fried chicken. \n\nThe combo fried rice was pretty good, but ended up drinking about 6 glasses of water due to the MSG and sodium content. You'd think that the cook spent his better years in the French Foreign Legion in the Sahara eating salt tablets and developed a taste for them. \n\nThe sesame chicken had a good flavor and a thick brown sweet sauce. I liked it a lot until it got cool and the sauce looked (with that stringy consistency) more like glue. You think I'm kidding? I'm not.\n\nGarlic fried chicken was bad. Just bad. It was like an over roasted dried out half chicken with some dried garlic pieces sprinkled on top. No spices, no flavor, no good. \n\nWe then got all kinds of lip from the waitress when we asked if they could change the channel on the TV from college football, to the Suns game. They made it into this big deal that the \"customers\" wanted to see the football game. Yeah right, it was University of West Virginia Vs. University of Connecticut! I would have believed it if it was a local team....\n\nIt's better than a 1 star joint, but only because it's borderline edible. To be avoided.","This restaurant is located in the Chinese Cultural Center and was the one restaurant that I had not been to. So after some shopping at one of the shops, we stepped in to have dinner.\n\nWe stepped in and asked for a seat for two. We were seated immediately. The place was decorated nicely and a lady playing the piano made for great ambiance.\n\nWe looked at the menu briefly and ordered our drinks, an appetizer, a soup and two main dishes. The drinks came out promptly and so did the rest of the meal. My goodness everything we ordered was very tasty.\n\nThe waiter service itself however was not even close to the decor and food. He never introduced himself, and although he took our order, our food itself was brought out by a kitchen person.\n\nAfter we ordered our waiter really never came back asking if we needed anything else, except to give us our check at the end and that was after the person I was dining with got up and asked a different waiter for it.\n\nIt's amazing how a place with great food, decor, and ambiance can mess it all up by crappy waiter service.","I love Dim Sum, my favorite Chinese dish.\n\nWhen Golden Buddha first open, they have excellent Dim sum. I went there many times, I tell my friend how good it is, But now,  they change cook, taste more like  week old left over. Rumor has it, they change cook every few month, so Quality of cooking change. (not sure if that is true, but that is what I was told.)\nMy advice is; when you walk in the door and the place is pack, = Good Cook. if the place is bare = bad cook. leave immediately. don't waste your money.","If you just \"want\" dim sum, go here. If you are \"craving\" dim sum, go elsewhere (take a 5 hour drive west to neighboring state, California).\n\nAnyway, I've been visiting Golden Buddha in the noontime for roughly 2 years now. I believe they moved from their original site (7th St. & Osborn), formerly \"China Doll.\" Relocation brought along better atmosphere and smiling faces. This does not mean, better dim sum. But since we are in Phoenix, I will settle for what they have to offer. \n\nBe mindful of the dim sum tab. It's itemized high-medium-low. \n\nShaomai can be found as combinations of pork/mushroom, shrimp, or shark fin (which should not be confused as true shark bits, as the shaomai is prepared to look like a shark's fin). These picks are okay...perhaps on a better day shao mai will be served in less-rigid, or fresher wrappers. Potstickers are okay as well, just the usual scallion and pork, and dry wrapper. The baby pork ribs in light black bean sauce and jalapenos is alright, but sometimes lacks in taste. Tripe is also served in its bare minimum...so if you enjoy the texture and flavor of tripe, try this with its clear sauce and thinly sliced carrots and celery.  \nBuche (that's what I call it), or fried sesame balls are also available, although if you wait until dessert, they will also be a bit stiff. There are a few other things that may be \"spotted\" but are not worth mentioning. \n\nDon't order from their lunch menu, as you can find these over-salted dishes at Panda Express anyway. \n\nOverall, dim sum at Golden Buddha is a place to go if you are around the vicinity and feel like having something apart from the usual fast food. However, discriminating palates- beware.","Not impressed with this place at all. This was not the friendliest place around, maybe because of the language barrier (most or all were clearly native Chinese speakers), or maybe just the attitude of the employees.\n\nI ordered the sweet and sour chicken lunch, which came with the typical egg drop soup, crab rangoon, and egg roll. The soup was ok - maybe it's just me, but I prefer a real spoon to the scoop that they gave me. The egg roll was tiny and not that great, and the crab rangoon was ok, but maybe a little undercooked. The chicken wasn't bad, but nothing special, as was the rice and other stuff on the plate.\n\nOverall, this was just not my kind of Chinese place.","Disappointing.  Mediocre at best.  I am staying at the Aloft hotel in phoenix and ordered some delivery. I ordered a couple american chinese food staples: general tso's chicken, dumplings and hot&sour soup.  Soup had zero flavor, dumplings tasted freezer burned and processed.  General tso chicken was ehh. \n\nA lot of good reviews on here so it must be for eat in and for their dim sum.  Don't order delivery, you will be left hungry and unsatisfied.","Went there on Saturday for early lunch.  My wife did the dim sum, it was okay, we were both disgusted by the sugar cane shrimp; but the rest was good.  \n\nI ordered the chicken szechwuan, the waitress warned me it was \"spicy\" the reason I ordered it.  It came out delicious, but not what I would call spicy.  Overall its hard to find good Chinese in the valley and I would call this good without hesitation.","So I was referred to this place from the front desk of my hotel. I'm from SF so I'm coming from a place with really good chinese food. \n\nThe dim sum is just \"ok\" nothing for me to write home about. The one dish that I really liked was the chinese broccoli cooked with garlic sauce. Yum yum yum.  It's in a big bowl, not oily, not saucy, just really good. I think it's $7.50.  \n\nIt's a somewhat pricey and just like all chinese restaurants, it's not the cleanest.  The chair was filthy.  the dishes weren't all that great.  I wouldn't go back unless I want the chinese broccoli.  \n\nSo I went on a Sunday and it was not crowded at all. There's not a huge asian population  in Phoenix (not that I could tell) so I don't think there's a high demand for dim sum.  And also, I sooooooo felt like taking a pic of this, but a Mexican lady was pushing one of the dim sum carts. That is unheard of in SF.  This is a mainly mandarin restaurant and the dim sum places I go are usually cantonese.  Not a big deal though since the dishes look the same. \n\nDude, there was a turtle in the fish tank that I saw as I left.  I hope they don't eat that!","A Premier Chinese Atmosphere,\nThe Chinese cultural center and Asian Garden produces an Asain atmosphere that can be recognized from the 202.  \n With Dim Sum served this location earns its respect from the local community.\n\nDim Sum tip,  You have to be smart with the Dim Sum ladies they look nice innocent but they are professional sales people that will sell you more dishes than you need before you know what to do.  \n\nI love the desserts here ask the server to see the dessert tray.","This restaurant has a bit of an identity crisis. It is in the Chinese cultural center, but serves Japanese beer (Kirin on tap!) and the live piano music is American pop. We had to ask for chopsticks.\n\nHaving said that, the service was professional. Our waiter held a hot appetizer for one of our party who was away from the table so that it would not be cold when he returned. We were asked frequently--and not too frequently--if things were ok both by our waiter and the manager/proprietor.\n\nThe food was ok-to-good. Fried shrimp egg rolls were dainty but yummy. Duck was tasty but very chewy. Kung-pao chicken was pleasantly spiced. Plenty of rice. A pitcher of ice water with lemon was left at the table. \n\nAtmosphere was also pleasant. Chairs comfortable, tables spaced well, restrooms large and clean...and there is indeed a large golden Buddha by the entrance.","I took a group of friends here and relatives other times. The place is consistently good for Dim-sum during lunch. It is typical Chinese and nothing fancy.\n\nWhat helps this place is the moat scenery.  3 stars for visiting here based on convenience since there are similar places in town.","Having grown up in Hong Kong and having eaten dim sum in London, NY, LA, SF and Vancouver (actually Richmond), I can confidently say I know my dim sum.\n\nGood selection of well-executed dim sum when the carts actually come around and there's anything left in it.  I'd give it 4 stars for food but the wait definitely detracted from the whole experience.\n\nI think the problem with Golden Buddha is that they can't handle the heavy flow on weekends.  There's not enough regular dim sum eaters like LA that can sustain a steady flow of diners throughout the week, forcing restaurants like Golden Buddha to depend heavily on extra part-time help on weekends.  \n\nDim sum takes serious skill so the chef still ends up doing most of the work.  When we looked into the kitchen, we saw a Chinese woman doing most of the cooking herself.  No wonder it took forever for a cart to come out and when it does, it's swarmed on by a pack of vultures.\n\nIf you're willing to eat at a more simply decorated place with a smaller menu, I'd highly recommend China Chan.  It's much more relaxed - usually no wait on weekends.  An experienced chef makes all the dim sum himself so the menu's much shorter but all the classics are on it.  Anything steamed is made to order so is very fresh.","Situated in the Chinese Cultural Center near the SkyHarbor Airport, this was another pleasant find. All I had was the Dim Sum menu, and I would say this is the best you're gonna get in Phoenix. Still worth the stop to get your Dim Sum fix. The cart ladies were pleasant and very happy to converse with me in Cantonese. Only downside was the chicken sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaves, naw mei gai, was way overcooked, and mushy.","Do you want to eat Chinese Food in an elegant environment on a Friday night in Phoenix? \n\nBe entertained by classic, quiet standards being played live on a piano while you dine?\n\nAre you 50 years old and Caucasian?\n\nThen the Golden Buddha is the place for you! \n\nIts in the Chinese Cultural Center Mall on 44th, and a popular weekend spot for Dim Sum. For a DIm Sum starved Valley of the Sun, Golden Buddha's is decent. \n\nFor dinner, though, it is awfully Americanized and not very authentic Chinese. But with a bunch of American customers coming for dinner, what do you expect? They probably think they are getting \"real Chinese\" food by going to the Chinese Mall, but then again, they are used to PF Chang's or Stix normally in their neighborhood, so this is a step up.\n\nThe best thing about this place is the decor, which is clean and nice, with a Hong Kong Junk boat design covering the ceiling from the bar into the dining room. The next best thing is the Piano interludes on weekend nights. The service is next, which is a little overly eager to remove your plate, and the last thing is the food. \n\nThey do give decent portions. I ordered Guo Teh (potstickers) and got 6 fat ones. But they weren't served with the usual soy, chili oil and vinegar, but a soy and green onions mixture. The Mapo Tofu was ok, as they used a nice silky tofu, which was nice, but no green onions, and sliced black mushrooms instead, which I like, but not in this dish.\n\nCome here for the ambiance and music in the evenings, or on the weekend days for Dim Sum.","Decent dim sum, especially to be found in the middle of the desert. Sadly, the best food I've had in Phoenix.","This place is a little difficult for me to review.  I was staying at the Hampton Inn across the street and this is the closest restaurant so off I went.\n\nI walked in and the owner or manager met me at the door and asked \"how many\"?\n\nI told him I wanted to order take out and handed me a menu and pointed to the waiting area which was covered in newspapers.  I chose to go to the bar, order a glass of wine, and peruse the menu.\n\nThe drinks are expensive but I didn't think the food was.  Less than $10 for my Mongolian Chicken which came with white sticky rice and a fortune cookie.  When ordering I asked if I could have fried rice instead of white rice but was told \"no\".  Most places allow this for a nominal fee.\n\nFine by me.  Give the white rice.  Food was prepared and their to-go boxes were a lot better than the standard white Chinese \"to go\" boxes.  They also included the plastic-ware, napkin, and soy sauce, which a lot of places forget.\n\nLooking around I found a whole lot of goodness along with a couple disappointments.  Most notably the newspaper strewn about and behind the bar, to the right were a lot of boxes stacked in an unsightly fashion.  I could have been a little more presentable in my opinion.\n\nI peeked into the dining room because I wanted to see if the piano music was piped in or live.  It was live which was very nice. Also, the dinning room looked very nice and cozy.\n\nAs I was leaving the same man who greeted me upon entering made sure to wish me a good evening.  My initial impression of the man was that he was surly and testy but that's just how he comes off.\n\nThe food was very good.  The Mongolian sauce was mixture of sweet with spice and the chicken and vegetables all tasted fresh.","My husband and I went there Saturday, the service was great!  Our friends were going to be late so they told us to start.  And start we did!\nThey were serving Dim Sum, something we had never tried, so glad we did, it was wonderful, hubby wouldn't do the chicken feet, but I think next time I will, it looked very good.\nOur friends showed up and ordered their food, and ate all of it, they said that usually they take food home, but it was so good they had to eat all of it!\nWe will be going back very soon!","Let's see, over 50... check \nold white man...........check \neats dinner ...............check \nlistens to the piano  check \n\nwow this must be the place for me, I mean after all it is in a Chinese mall, no make that a Chinese Cultural Center. How could I possibly have discerning taste with such trickery to get me here to eat. \nDude if you are going to rate a restaurant no need to degrade others with your arrogance. \nFool is my review of wanugee N. \n\nNow on the restaurant. The last time we were here the food was not good, the piano was too loud and the waitress had a real attitude. IT won't keep me from going back as I have had good meals and wait service too. \n\nBack to wanugee N. I do not expect any place in Phx. to have authentic Chinese food, by that I mean the street food one finds in China. \nBut I do expect what I fork in to my mouth is worth what I am going to fork over in cost. Even an old white guy like me can tell the difference between good and bad food. No matter what it is called.","Okay so Ive been glum the past few days as I have an impending birthday. Every year this time I get all down in the dumps.. not that I'm not happy with my life cause life is good. Its more like getting further away from my youth and closer to being well, old. All of my grandparents were crotchety, sourpuss drama queens.. is that my fate? Can I break the mold or am I to going to be a crotchety sourpuss?\n\nSo as I contemplate and figure out what I'm going to do with my birthday baggage I decide to squash it with food. All weekend Ive been eating out and having a good time. This is one of the few times outside of a vacation where I will live it completely and to the near of sheer gluttony. So why not dim sum? \n\nIve chowed much dim sum in my 36 years of earthen wear.. of course some good and some bad. I have never been to a place where every dish was great.. Golden Buddha is no exception to this.. they do the basics well enough and have enough funky cool Asian style to keep me interested in returning. The carts around 1130 flow well but around noon it' s full blown freeway action! In fact there might be some road kill in there based on some of the looks on that last steam cart.. \n\nMe and 3 others who were feeling my pain ordered 14, count them, 14 different dishes. One of my friends is from Georgia and had never had dim sum but he is so courageous and unflinching that he was just a blast. Just the shot in the arm to get me out of my funk. I remember the first time I had dim sum.. my eyes wide open, nostrils flared and excited to see what was under the next steamer lid. That was him today.. one exciting thing after the next.. he was even willing to try chicken feet but this is one of those dishes not done very well here. \n\nMy friend took me back to a time where I was younger and less experienced. He looked up to me to guide him through the noodles, bao and sui mai.. like a big brother.. I'm privileged that I could show him something new and exciting and he was so into it! So instead of feeling sorry for myself I felt experienced and useful.. that there is something I can give back to others.. that its not all about me and me aging but about what can be shared with others.\n\nThere is so much more to do, give and feel in this short time we are here.. and Ill do it to, one bite at a time.","The best to be found in land locked Arizona.  My favorite sticky rice is here.  They have dim sum every day, but not a huge selection, though you can order off the menu.  I think it is much bigger on the weekends.  I'm just happy I can get my fix 7 days a week.  Beautiful gardens to walk through, with fish ponds, and a 99 market next door!","I ate at Golden Buddha a few weeks ago.  We ate at the restaurant after a day at the zoo with our 4 year old and had a blast.  The piano bar played tunes for my daughter and the staff was more than accommodating.  The general tso chicken was better than anything I can get in Tucson.  The soup was chocked full of fresh, read FRESH, not canned, vegetables.  All in all, I was very satisfied with the meal and the service.  Plus the decor is very nice, clean and cheery. \n\nEat at Golden Buddha.","For those who gave this place low marks, forgive me. I really like this place. Now I haven't tried various dim sum places so I'm reserving the right to downgrade the place as needed. The variety of food is plentiful, and the carts just keep on coming. I love the steamed pork buns, and the shiu mai (not sure if I spelled that correctly). Yesterday, my favorite pick was the deep fried rolls of taro and shrimp. YUM! I have never ordered from their menu so I can only talk about their dim sum. My friends and I try to go eat dim sum almost every Sunday. It's a cheap way to try new foods, and if you don't like it, well.. you can get away with pushing it aside with minimal guilt. Give it a try! You might be surprised.","I like Golden Buddha, have taken many friends there for Dim Sum.  \nTry not to \"hit\" the dumpling cart to heavy; otherwise cannot finish it to the dessert cart (LOL).\nLove the jasmine tea and the staff willing to help you if you do not understand the what each item is.\nSingapore Rice Noodles a favorite, along with any of the shrimp dumplings; also the broccoli and green beans.\nOnly wish that the carts with eggplant stuffed with shrimp or green peppers with shrimp were not on \"heated\" carts; by the time it gets to you the food is cold.\nOnly concern is that went on 22MAY2010 at 1:30PM; there was a closed sign due to electricity???\nREVISED: 26MAY2010 - called this evening - looks like they are back open again.","I've been to the Golden Buddha on several occasions and it is my favorite, by far, for honest Chinese food. \nWhile I've sampled everything from their vegetarian to their beef, I love their mandarin chicken. More recently, I was delighted to relive the wonders of their Kung Pao Chicken and Beef with Broccoli. \nI absolutely love the egg drop soup and mini crab rangoons that come with the meal.","The very first time I went to Golden Buddha was with my BFF and it was our first dim sum experience. Little did I know this would forever change my life and eating experiences. Although I must admit that first time was a bit awkward.\n\nGB wisely takes reservations which was wonderful (even though it wasn't crazy busy). Our assorted dim sum plates were flavorful and fresh. And the carts seemed to be in constant rotation so we were never too far from a good selection.\n\nWhat really helps GB is its location. The Cofco Center is an experience in itself, where one can have herbs specially blended, select a fresh member of marine life to take home and cook or browse through a store with one of the largest selections of Buddhas and hand fans I've experienced outside of San Francisco.","I've been to Golden Buddha a few times and have not been disappointed. \n\nThey have a LARGE selection of Dim Sum and if you're not careful you can get carried away.\n\nTry and get there early and you'll get the best and most fresh selection.\nMake sure you walk around the garden when you're done.","Probably the most comprehensive Chinese menu in the Valley.  Pick from well over 100 dishes, but if you want the best order the Peking Duck.  Everything else is very good, but without a wow factor.  You'll see lots of Chinese people in this massive restaurant, which probably means they're doing a fine job in the kitchen.","I very much enjoyed eating here. Food was great. Fairly fast service. Wasn't expensive either for the 4 of us.","Golden Buddha has GREAT dim sum.  Their prices are reasonable and the staff is very polite wheeling their little carts.  I tend to go on the weekend because there is more selection but they do dim sum throughout the week.  They also have some very authentic dishes on the menu for those who are more of the adventurous types.  Be sure to say hello to the turtles the next time you go.","This place in the Chinese Cultural Center has a very pretty and elegant bar area. I was pleased to learn that they had some very reasonable and delicious happy hour snacks. This is a good place for a Pina Colada. I had one by myself along with some dumplings and fried shrimp appetizer. Sadly I never brought anyone else here with me. It was happy hour heaven but you know? A lot of my friends in AZ pretty much hang out in one neighborhood or another and nobody I know really lives close to the Buddha.\nThe airport is pretty close by. This might be a good pre-flight send-off location.","I have had dim sum in New Orleans and Phoenix (not SF), and this is about equal to the best of New Orleans as far as flavor.\nAs for ambiance, today was a good day. I've had dim sum here about a dozen times, and have had very good service and quality 90% of the time, including weekends. I have had bad days here, but since today was good, I'll rate accordingly. It's closer to a 4.5, but since I can't give half-stars, I rounded up.\nDon't expect me to give these the right names, but... I was less than impressed with the bbq pork balls. They tasted too much like honey and the beef was minimal. The bbq sauce tasted bottled. Outside of that, their herbal hot tea is delicious even on a hot day.\nThe shu mai were very good, and the shrimp in a spinach dumpling was fantastic. A definite don't miss is their sticky rice in lotus leaf. It's among the best I've had anywhere. Just be careful; you'll find bones in it every once in a while. Go for any of their steamed dumplings; they're very flavorful. As others have said, I love the Chinese broccoli, but you'll only find it on the carts on weekends. Otherwise order it off the menu.\nToday (11:30 lunch) the carts came around often, and everything except the pork buns was piping hot and fresh. By the way, despite the price increases, even the sticky rice was considered a medium size entree, and the two of us eating there escaped with a bill under $20 and we were done in under 30 minutes.\nI strongly recommend the dim sum here, whether you've had it a million times or have never had it before. You usually won't be disappointed.","I don't really understand the poor reviews on this place.....maybe it depends on the day you go? We went on a Sunday, it was crazy busy, but service was great! (of course, my view of customer service is a little different then the rest... I used to live on an island where you were just happy to find what you were looking for, let alone expect good customer service) Anyways, our server was very sweet! Always had a smile on her face. The carts served us promplty and none of the food was cold. They always had whatever we wanted (I hate having to wait for the next cart).\n\nNow, as for the actual dim sum and food.......holy cow, to die for! So flavorful and fresh!! The broccoli makes you sing...and the wine noodles, make you cry. You leave with very weird mixed emotions, but mostly a happy belly full of yummy food.\n\nIn my opinion, this is the best dim sum I have been able to find in Phx. I'm ditching my previous spot (Mekong Palace) and will be back to Golden Buddha when the dim sum monster strikes again!"],"type":["Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low

waiter was to be found about ten minutes later they gave us our water and left again! It wasn't even busy! There were only TWO dim sum carts floating around somewhere. Then our waiter finally came around and took our orders of lunch entrees. The food was not even that good as the reviews that are posted on here. When we came up to pay, the bill was super overpriced. I will not be returning here, I am better off eating at Great Wall Cuisine.","If this place had zero stars I would have given them that ! Let me start off by saying I was so excited to read all great reviews so maybe I just came in on a off day? We walked in and were seated came over and asked if we wanted water or tea I guess they don't serve anything Else, Then we placed an order pork dumplings and sticky rice nasty! Then I asked if they served egg rolls they said they were out!!! they pushed their little carts around with hot plates that basically steam the food and is not fresh and what you get is soggy poor customer service we had to get up and look for someone to give us our tab so we could get the heck out of there are get some real food. It looked like it would be a great place for groups of people would not recommend if you are on mission for what you want and want to place an order but it could be a fun experience for some people.","You walk into a Chinese restaurant on a Saturday afternoon for dim sum and you expect the place to be PACKED.  Well, walking in to a pretty much empty dining room, it's a VERY CLEAR SIGN.  But my friend insisted and I was very hesitant for good reasons.  Another indicator, the majority of the patrons were NON Asian.  \n\nFood: You walk in and you see carts of the food by the entrance to the dining room.  Umm, I thought dim sum should come right off the steamer and into the carts and they roll it around, not sitting around.  The dim sum was garbage.  It had the typical selection, but at minimum.  \n\nService: It's ok.  But it doesn't make up for the horrible food.\n\nBottom line: NO WAY!  Stay away!","I've been here many times...Mother's Day with family, dim sum with book club, etc. But I will not go back again.  I stopped in to ask the owner about a donation or reduced price for a class of under-privileged kids that I volunteer with.  His reaction was to scoff and shoo me out the door while handing me his card and saying I could email him.  He turned his back and headed off to the messy newspaper-strewn table he haunts between guests arrivals.  Maybe he's a community-minded business owner, but then again, maybe he's not.  I'll be dining elsewhere.","Being from Chicago, we are used to getting authentic Chinese food all the time.  But when we first starting spending a lot of time in Scottsdale/Phoenix, we found it a challenge to get authentic Chinese food.  We were excited to find the Golden Buddha and have made many trips over the years all the way from the Troon North area to get our fix.  However, service has declined to the point where it is no longer worth the aggravation.  We went there last night for Chinese New Year and will never go back.  Granted they were very busy because of a lot of large tables there, but waiting almost an hour to get our food is not acceptable under any circumstance!  45 mins. into our wait, the waitress came back (after we flagged her down to ask about our food) and said one of the dishes we ordered was not available....after 45 mins.!!!! What makes the whole experience an unforgivable one is that the manager/owner is so indifferent and never apologized or offered a discount off the bill...nothing.  When we left, the same manager was at the piano singing in Chinese. Huh?  Other than Nee House in Scottsdale, the search goes on for a restaurant that serves authentic Chinese food closer to home.","I will NEVER go there again.  I reserved a table for a group of 16 people for 5:00 PM on Christmas Eve .  The person on the phone ( I believe the manager) repeatedly asked me to call ahead and give him an accurate head count since he said they'd be swamped that day.  I followed up with him twice.  \nWhen the first couple of us arrived, we had menus shoved in our faces immediately and told we \"Must order now.  Must order now\" because they were going to be busy later on.  The place was practically empty.  As each person arrived, they were treated the same way. \nWe rushed and placed our orders and then they brought out our checks WAY before we saw any sign of our food.  I have never in my life been treated so rudely by a restaurant.\nIt was utter chaos when the food started coming out while everyone struggled to get the correct dish they ordered.  One person didn't get her food until we were all just about finished eating. \nOne top of all that, the food wasn't even good.  I've had better Kung Pao Chicken at Panda Express!\nAfter being rushed through our meal, the place wasn't even half full by the time we left.  I thought being at the Cultural Center, this restaurant would be a sure thing but boy was I wrong.  Lovely way to spend Christmas Eve..","If you are looking a chinese restaurant to host a big party look some other than the Golden Buddah.  I recently attended a banquet at the Golden Buddah and I was shocked at the level of quality of food and service.  Of the 10 dishes served 4 were nearly inedible.  \n\nThere was a crab claw appetizer, most chinese restaurants prepare this dish by taking a crab claw surrounding it with ground shrimp, batter and then deep fry.  At Golden Buddah, the crab claw served was mostly batter.  \n\nThe shark fin soup served was mostly broth.  Shark fin is an expensive ingredient and most places usually use imitation shark fin, but come on at least put something in there so that I know I'm eating soup and not dirty sink water.  \n\nGinger scallion lobster is battered, fried, and then stir fried in a sauce with ginger and scallions.  The ginger scallion lobster served was over-cooked and dried out.  \n\nLastly, there was a steamed fish.  The fish was raw in the middle.   \n\nIt wasn't all bad, there was a crispy chicken with garlic dish that was pretty good, but out of 10 dishes 4 were bad, 5 were okay, and 1 was good.  \n\nDoes 4 bad dishes out of 10 warrant a one star rating?  Well it does when you factor in the service.  The soup, appetizer, and first entree arrived timely, but after that there was a 1 hour gap before we received the next dish.  The dishes were not served with accompanying white rice which I thought was odd.  We had to ask for it, and even the rice took a while to arrive.","I agree with Crystal C., that the dim sum isn't the greatest I've ever had. In fact, I am not sure if the meal was so tasty that it was memorable. I do remember the \"calamari\" was not really calamari, like you would think. It was presented more like a sweet and sour pork (so calamari with LOTS of breading) without any sauce. As a result, the dish was dry and salty.\n\nThe sticky rice was good (hard to mess up), the chicken feet were okay (needed more five spice powder), and the shumai was alright. The noodles were good, and I can see why the cart ran out after the first round. The diners were an equal mix of Asians and Americans. I would've preferred to see more Asians eating (as I am used to in a Chinatown and gives an indication of authenticity), but I do realize we're in Phoenix where the Asian population is not like San Francisco or Houston. \n\nThe meal came to about $30 for two, including jasmine tea. The carts are loud because they are made out of metal and roll on tile. I am also not used to staff members shouting what they have in their cart, like a newspaper boy yelling \"Extra! Extra!\" Christmas music was playing after mid-January, so the atmosphere felt strange. Next time I visit the city, I probably will pass.","Can't say that I was very impressed. Came for dinner in a hopeful and enthusiastic mood since the reviews have been pretty good, but I don't think this place lives up to its current good, but declining rating.\n\nOrdered the Combo fried rice (shrimp, chicken, beef, pork), sesame chicken, and garlic fried chicken. \n\nThe combo fried rice was pretty good, but ended up drinking about 6 glasses of water due to the MSG and sodium content. You'd think that the cook spent his better years in the French Foreign Legion in the Sahara eating salt tablets and developed a taste for them. \n\nThe sesame chicken had a good flavor and a thick brown sweet sauce. I liked it a lot until it got cool and the sauce looked (with that stringy consistency) more like glue. You think I'm kidding? I'm not.\n\nGarlic fried chicken was bad. Just bad. It was like an over roasted dried out half chicken with some dried garlic pieces sprinkled on top. No spices, no flavor, no good. \n\nWe then got all kinds of lip from the waitress when we asked if they could change the channel on the TV from college football, to the Suns game. They made it into this big deal that the \"customers\" wanted to see the football game. Yeah right, it was University of West Virginia Vs. University of Connecticut! I would have believed it if it was a local team....\n\nIt's better than a 1 star joint, but only because it's borderline edible. To be avoided.","This restaurant is located in the Chinese Cultural Center and was the one restaurant that I had not been to. So after some shopping at one of the shops, we stepped in to have dinner.\n\nWe stepped in and asked for a seat for two. We were seated immediately. The place was decorated nicely and a lady playing the piano made for great ambiance.\n\nWe looked at the menu briefly and ordered our drinks, an appetizer, a soup and two main dishes. The drinks came out promptly and so did the rest of the meal. My goodness everything we ordered was very tasty.\n\nThe waiter service itself however was not even close to the decor and food. He never introduced himself, and although he took our order, our food itself was brought out by a kitchen person.\n\nAfter we ordered our waiter really never came back asking if we needed anything else, except to give us our check at the end and that was after the person I was dining with got up and asked a different waiter for it.\n\nIt's amazing how a place with great food, decor, and ambiance can mess it all up by crappy waiter service.","I love Dim Sum, my favorite Chinese dish.\n\nWhen Golden Buddha first open, they have excellent Dim sum. I went there many times, I tell my friend how good it is, But now,  they change cook, taste more like  week old left over. Rumor has it, they change cook every few month, so Quality of cooking change. (not sure if that is true, but that is what I was told.)\nMy advice is; when you walk in the door and the place is pack, = Good Cook. if the place is bare = bad cook. leave immediately. don't waste your money.","If you just \"want\" dim sum, go here. If you are \"craving\" dim sum, go elsewhere (take a 5 hour drive west to neighboring state, California).\n\nAnyway, I've been visiting Golden Buddha in the noontime for roughly 2 years now. I believe they moved from their original site (7th St. & Osborn), formerly \"China Doll.\" Relocation brought along better atmosphere and smiling faces. This does not mean, better dim sum. But since we are in Phoenix, I will settle for what they have to offer. \n\nBe mindful of the dim sum tab. It's itemized high-medium-low. \n\nShaomai can be found as combinations of pork/mushroom, shrimp, or shark fin (which should not be confused as true shark bits, as the shaomai is prepared to look like a shark's fin). These picks are okay...perhaps on a better day shao mai will be served in less-rigid, or fresher wrappers. Potstickers are okay as well, just the usual scallion and pork, and dry wrapper. The baby pork ribs in light black bean sauce and jalapenos is alright, but sometimes lacks in taste. Tripe is also served in its bare minimum...so if you enjoy the texture and flavor of tripe, try this with its clear sauce and thinly sliced carrots and celery.  \nBuche (that's what I call it), or fried sesame balls are also available, although if you wait until dessert, they will also be a bit stiff. There are a few other things that may be \"spotted\" but are not worth mentioning. \n\nDon't order from their lunch menu, as you can find these over-salted dishes at Panda Express anyway. \n\nOverall, dim sum at Golden Buddha is a place to go if you are around the vicinity and feel like having something apart from the usual fast food. However, discriminating palates- beware.","Not impressed with this place at all. This was not the friendliest place around, maybe because of the language barrier (most or all were clearly native Chinese speakers), or maybe just the attitude of the employees.\n\nI ordered the sweet and sour chicken lunch, which came with the typical egg drop soup, crab rangoon, and egg roll. The soup was ok - maybe it's just me, but I prefer a real spoon to the scoop that they gave me. The egg roll was tiny and not that great, and the crab rangoon was ok, but maybe a little undercooked. The chicken wasn't bad, but nothing special, as was the rice and other stuff on the plate.\n\nOverall, this was just not my kind of Chinese place.","Disappointing.  Mediocre at best.  I am staying at the Aloft hotel in phoenix and ordered some delivery. I ordered a couple american chinese food staples: general tso's chicken, dumplings and hot&sour soup.  Soup had zero flavor, dumplings tasted freezer burned and processed.  General tso chicken was ehh. \n\nA lot of good reviews on here so it must be for eat in and for their dim sum.  Don't order delivery, you will be left hungry and unsatisfied.","Went there on Saturday for early lunch.  My wife did the dim sum, it was okay, we were both disgusted by the sugar cane shrimp; but the rest was good.  \n\nI ordered the chicken szechwuan, the waitress warned me it was \"spicy\" the reason I ordered it.  It came out delicious, but not what I would call spicy.  Overall its hard to find good Chinese in the valley and I would call this good without hesitation.","So I was referred to this place from the front desk of my hotel. I'm from SF so I'm coming from a place with really good chinese food. \n\nThe dim sum is just \"ok\" nothing for me to write home about. The one dish that I really liked was the chinese broccoli cooked with garlic sauce. Yum yum yum.  It's in a big bowl, not oily, not saucy, just really good. I think it's $7.50.  \n\nIt's a somewhat pricey and just like all chinese restaurants, it's not the cleanest.  The chair was filthy.  the dishes weren't all that great.  I wouldn't go back unless I want the chinese broccoli.  \n\nSo I went on a Sunday and it was not crowded at all. There's not a huge asian population  in Phoenix (not that I could tell) so I don't think there's a high demand for dim sum.  And also, I sooooooo felt like taking a pic of this, but a Mexican lady was pushing one of the dim sum carts. That is unheard of in SF.  This is a mainly mandarin restaurant and the dim sum places I go are usually cantonese.  Not a big deal though since the dishes look the same. \n\nDude, there was a turtle in the fish tank that I saw as I left.  I hope they don't eat that!","A Premier Chinese Atmosphere,\nThe Chinese cultural center and Asian Garden produces an Asain atmosphere that can be recognized from the 202.  \n With Dim Sum served this location earns its respect from the local community.\n\nDim Sum tip,  You have to be smart with the Dim Sum ladies they look nice innocent but they are professional sales people that will sell you more dishes than you need before you know what to do.  \n\nI love the desserts here ask the server to see the dessert tray.","This restaurant has a bit of an identity crisis. It is in the Chinese cultural center, but serves Japanese beer (Kirin on tap!) and the live piano music is American pop. We had to ask for chopsticks.\n\nHaving said that, the service was professional. Our waiter held a hot appetizer for one of our party who was away from the table so that it would not be cold when he returned. We were asked frequently--and not too frequently--if things were ok both by our waiter and the manager/proprietor.\n\nThe food was ok-to-good. Fried shrimp egg rolls were dainty but yummy. Duck was tasty but very chewy. Kung-pao chicken was pleasantly spiced. Plenty of rice. A pitcher of ice water with lemon was left at the table. \n\nAtmosphere was also pleasant. Chairs comfortable, tables spaced well, restrooms large and clean...and there is indeed a large golden Buddha by the entrance.","I took a group of friends here and relatives other times. The place is consistently good for Dim-sum during lunch. It is typical Chinese and nothing fancy.\n\nWhat helps this place is the moat scenery.  3 stars for visiting here based on convenience since there are similar places in town.","Having grown up in Hong Kong and having eaten dim sum in London, NY, LA, SF and Vancouver (actually Richmond), I can confidently say I know my dim sum.\n\nGood selection of well-executed dim sum when the carts actually come around and there's anything left in it.  I'd give it 4 stars for food but the wait definitely detracted from the whole experience.\n\nI think the problem with Golden Buddha is that they can't handle the heavy flow on weekends.  There's not enough regular dim sum eaters like LA that can sustain a steady flow of diners throughout the week, forcing restaurants like Golden Buddha to depend heavily on extra part-time help on weekends.  \n\nDim sum takes serious skill so the chef still ends up doing most of the work.  When we looked into the kitchen, we saw a Chinese woman doing most of the cooking herself.  No wonder it took forever for a cart to come out and when it does, it's swarmed on by a pack of vultures.\n\nIf you're willing to eat at a more simply decorated place with a smaller menu, I'd highly recommend China Chan.  It's much more relaxed - usually no wait on weekends.  An experienced chef makes all the dim sum himself so the menu's much shorter but all the classics are on it.  Anything steamed is made to order so is very fresh.","Situated in the Chinese Cultural Center near the SkyHarbor Airport, this was another pleasant find. All I had was the Dim Sum menu, and I would say this is the best you're gonna get in Phoenix. Still worth the stop to get your Dim Sum fix. The cart ladies were pleasant and very happy to converse with me in Cantonese. Only downside was the chicken sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaves, naw mei gai, was way overcooked, and mushy.","Do you want to eat Chinese Food in an elegant environment on a Friday night in Phoenix? \n\nBe entertained by classic, quiet standards being played live on a piano while you dine?\n\nAre you 50 years old and Caucasian?\n\nThen the Golden Buddha is the place for you! \n\nIts in the Chinese Cultural Center Mall on 44th, and a popular weekend spot for Dim Sum. For a DIm Sum starved Valley of the Sun, Golden Buddha's is decent. \n\nFor dinner, though, it is awfully Americanized and not very authentic Chinese. But with a bunch of American customers coming for dinner, what do you expect? They probably think they are getting \"real Chinese\" food by going to the Chinese Mall, but then again, they are used to PF Chang's or Stix normally in their neighborhood, so this is a step up.\n\nThe best thing about this place is the decor, which is clean and nice, with a Hong Kong Junk boat design covering the ceiling from the bar into the dining room. The next best thing is the Piano interludes on weekend nights. The service is next, which is a little overly eager to remove your plate, and the last thing is the food. \n\nThey do give decent portions. I ordered Guo Teh (potstickers) and got 6 fat ones. But they weren't served with the usual soy, chili oil and vinegar, but a soy and green onions mixture. The Mapo Tofu was ok, as they used a nice silky tofu, which was nice, but no green onions, and sliced black mushrooms instead, which I like, but not in this dish.\n\nCome here for the ambiance and music in the evenings, or on the weekend days for Dim Sum.","Decent dim sum, especially to be found in the middle of the desert. Sadly, the best food I've had in Phoenix.","This place is a little difficult for me to review.  I was staying at the Hampton Inn across the street and this is the closest restaurant so off I went.\n\nI walked in and the owner or manager met me at the door and asked \"how many\"?\n\nI told him I wanted to order take out and handed me a menu and pointed to the waiting area which was covered in newspapers.  I chose to go to the bar, order a glass of wine, and peruse the menu.\n\nThe drinks are expensive but I didn't think the food was.  Less than $10 for my Mongolian Chicken which came with white sticky rice and a fortune cookie.  When ordering I asked if I could have fried rice instead of white rice but was told \"no\".  Most places allow this for a nominal fee.\n\nFine by me.  Give the white rice.  Food was prepared and their to-go boxes were a lot better than the standard white Chinese \"to go\" boxes.  They also included the plastic-ware, napkin, and soy sauce, which a lot of places forget.\n\nLooking around I found a whole lot of goodness along with a couple disappointments.  Most notably the newspaper strewn about and behind the bar, to the right were a lot of boxes stacked in an unsightly fashion.  I could have been a little more presentable in my opinion.\n\nI peeked into the dining room because I wanted to see if the piano music was piped in or live.  It was live which was very nice. Also, the dinning room looked very nice and cozy.\n\nAs I was leaving the same man who greeted me upon entering made sure to wish me a good evening.  My initial impression of the man was that he was surly and testy but that's just how he comes off.\n\nThe food was very good.  The Mongolian sauce was mixture of sweet with spice and the chicken and vegetables all tasted fresh.","My husband and I went there Saturday, the service was great!  Our friends were going to be late so they told us to start.  And start we did!\nThey were serving Dim Sum, something we had never tried, so glad we did, it was wonderful, hubby wouldn't do the chicken feet, but I think next time I will, it looked very good.\nOur friends showed up and ordered their food, and ate all of it, they said that usually they take food home, but it was so good they had to eat all of it!\nWe will be going back very soon!","Let's see, over 50... check \nold white man...........check \neats dinner ...............check \nlistens to the piano  check \n\nwow this must be the place for me, I mean after all it is in a Chinese mall, no make that a Chinese Cultural Center. How could I possibly have discerning taste with such trickery to get me here to eat. \nDude if you are going to rate a restaurant no need to degrade others with your arrogance. \nFool is my review of wanugee N. \n\nNow on the restaurant. The last time we were here the food was not good, the piano was too loud and the waitress had a real attitude. IT won't keep me from going back as I have had good meals and wait service too. \n\nBack to wanugee N. I do not expect any place in Phx. to have authentic Chinese food, by that I mean the street food one finds in China. \nBut I do expect what I fork in to my mouth is worth what I am going to fork over in cost. Even an old white guy like me can tell the difference between good and bad food. No matter what it is called.","Okay so Ive been glum the past few days as I have an impending birthday. Every year this time I get all down in the dumps.. not that I'm not happy with my life cause life is good. Its more like getting further away from my youth and closer to being well, old. All of my grandparents were crotchety, sourpuss drama queens.. is that my fate? Can I break the mold or am I to going to be a crotchety sourpuss?\n\nSo as I contemplate and figure out what I'm going to do with my birthday baggage I decide to squash it with food. All weekend Ive been eating out and having a good time. This is one of the few times outside of a vacation where I will live it completely and to the near of sheer gluttony. So why not dim sum? \n\nIve chowed much dim sum in my 36 years of earthen wear.. of course some good and some bad. I have never been to a place where every dish was great.. Golden Buddha is no exception to this.. they do the basics well enough and have enough funky cool Asian style to keep me interested in returning. The carts around 1130 flow well but around noon it' s full blown freeway action! In fact there might be some road kill in there based on some of the looks on that last steam cart.. \n\nMe and 3 others who were feeling my pain ordered 14, count them, 14 different dishes. One of my friends is from Georgia and had never had dim sum but he is so courageous and unflinching that he was just a blast. Just the shot in the arm to get me out of my funk. I remember the first time I had dim sum.. my eyes wide open, nostrils flared and excited to see what was under the next steamer lid. That was him today.. one exciting thing after the next.. he was even willing to try chicken feet but this is one of those dishes not done very well here. \n\nMy friend took me back to a time where I was younger and less experienced. He looked up to me to guide him through the noodles, bao and sui mai.. like a big brother.. I'm privileged that I could show him something new and exciting and he was so into it! So instead of feeling sorry for myself I felt experienced and useful.. that there is something I can give back to others.. that its not all about me and me aging but about what can be shared with others.\n\nThere is so much more to do, give and feel in this short time we are here.. and Ill do it to, one bite at a time.","The best to be found in land locked Arizona.  My favorite sticky rice is here.  They have dim sum every day, but not a huge selection, though you can order off the menu.  I think it is much bigger on the weekends.  I'm just happy I can get my fix 7 days a week.  Beautiful gardens to walk through, with fish ponds, and a 99 market next door!","I ate at Golden Buddha a few weeks ago.  We ate at the restaurant after a day at the zoo with our 4 year old and had a blast.  The piano bar played tunes for my daughter and the staff was more than accommodating.  The general tso chicken was better than anything I can get in Tucson.  The soup was chocked full of fresh, read FRESH, not canned, vegetables.  All in all, I was very satisfied with the meal and the service.  Plus the decor is very nice, clean and cheery. \n\nEat at Golden Buddha.","For those who gave this place low marks, forgive me. I really like this place. Now I haven't tried various dim sum places so I'm reserving the right to downgrade the place as needed. The variety of food is plentiful, and the carts just keep on coming. I love the steamed pork buns, and the shiu mai (not sure if I spelled that correctly). Yesterday, my favorite pick was the deep fried rolls of taro and shrimp. YUM! I have never ordered from their menu so I can only talk about their dim sum. My friends and I try to go eat dim sum almost every Sunday. It's a cheap way to try new foods, and if you don't like it, well.. you can get away with pushing it aside with minimal guilt. Give it a try! You might be surprised.","I like Golden Buddha, have taken many friends there for Dim Sum.  \nTry not to \"hit\" the dumpling cart to heavy; otherwise cannot finish it to the dessert cart (LOL).\nLove the jasmine tea and the staff willing to help you if you do not understand the what each item is.\nSingapore Rice Noodles a favorite, along with any of the shrimp dumplings; also the broccoli and green beans.\nOnly wish that the carts with eggplant stuffed with shrimp or green peppers with shrimp were not on \"heated\" carts; by the time it gets to you the food is cold.\nOnly concern is that went on 22MAY2010 at 1:30PM; there was a closed sign due to electricity???\nREVISED: 26MAY2010 - called this evening - looks like they are back open again.","I've been to the Golden Buddha on several occasions and it is my favorite, by far, for honest Chinese food. \nWhile I've sampled everything from their vegetarian to their beef, I love their mandarin chicken. More recently, I was delighted to relive the wonders of their Kung Pao Chicken and Beef with Broccoli. \nI absolutely love the egg drop soup and mini crab rangoons that come with the meal.","The very first time I went to Golden Buddha was with my BFF and it was our first dim sum experience. Little did I know this would forever change my life and eating experiences. Although I must admit that first time was a bit awkward.\n\nGB wisely takes reservations which was wonderful (even though it wasn't crazy busy). Our assorted dim sum plates were flavorful and fresh. And the carts seemed to be in constant rotation so we were never too far from a good selection.\n\nWhat really helps GB is its location. The Cofco Center is an experience in itself, where one can have herbs specially blended, select a fresh member of marine life to take home and cook or browse through a store with one of the largest selections of Buddhas and hand fans I've experienced outside of San Francisco.","I've been to Golden Buddha a few times and have not been disappointed. \n\nThey have a LARGE selection of Dim Sum and if you're not careful you can get carried away.\n\nTry and get there early and you'll get the best and most fresh selection.\nMake sure you walk around the garden when you're done.","Probably the most comprehensive Chinese menu in the Valley.  Pick from well over 100 dishes, but if you want the best order the Peking Duck.  Everything else is very good, but without a wow factor.  You'll see lots of Chinese people in this massive restaurant, which probably means they're doing a fine job in the kitchen.","I very much enjoyed eating here. Food was great. Fairly fast service. Wasn't expensive either for the 4 of us.","Golden Buddha has GREAT dim sum.  Their prices are reasonable and the staff is very polite wheeling their little carts.  I tend to go on the weekend because there is more selection but they do dim sum throughout the week.  They also have some very authentic dishes on the menu for those who are more of the adventurous types.  Be sure to say hello to the turtles the next time you go.","This place in the Chinese Cultural Center has a very pretty and elegant bar area. I was pleased to learn that they had some very reasonable and delicious happy hour snacks. This is a good place for a Pina Colada. I had one by myself along with some dumplings and fried shrimp appetizer. Sadly I never brought anyone else here with me. It was happy hour heaven but you know? A lot of my friends in AZ pretty much hang out in one neighborhood or another and nobody I know really lives close to the Buddha.\nThe airport is pretty close by. This might be a good pre-flight send-off location.","I have had dim sum in New Orleans and Phoenix (not SF), and this is about equal to the best of New Orleans as far as flavor.\nAs for ambiance, today was a good day. I've had dim sum here about a dozen times, and have had very good service and quality 90% of the time, including weekends. I have had bad days here, but since today was good, I'll rate accordingly. It's closer to a 4.5, but since I can't give half-stars, I rounded up.\nDon't expect me to give these the right names, but... I was less than impressed with the bbq pork balls. They tasted too much like honey and the beef was minimal. The bbq sauce tasted bottled. Outside of that, their herbal hot tea is delicious even on a hot day.\nThe shu mai were very good, and the shrimp in a spinach dumpling was fantastic. A definite don't miss is their sticky rice in lotus leaf. It's among the best I've had anywhere. Just be careful; you'll find bones in it every once in a while. Go for any of their steamed dumplings; they're very flavorful. As others have said, I love the Chinese broccoli, but you'll only find it on the carts on weekends. Otherwise order it off the menu.\nToday (11:30 lunch) the carts came around often, and everything except the pork buns was piping hot and fresh. By the way, despite the price increases, even the sticky rice was considered a medium size entree, and the two of us eating there escaped with a bill under $20 and we were done in under 30 minutes.\nI strongly recommend the dim sum here, whether you've had it a million times or have never had it before. You usually won't be disappointed.","I don't really understand the poor reviews on this place.....maybe it depends on the day you go? We went on a Sunday, it was crazy busy, but service was great! (of course, my view of customer service is a little different then the rest... I used to live on an island where you were just happy to find what you were looking for, let alone expect good customer service) Anyways, our server was very sweet! Always had a smile on her face. The carts served us promplty and none of the food was cold. They always had whatever we wanted (I hate having to wait for the next cart).\n\nNow, as for the actual dim sum and food.......holy cow, to die for! So flavorful and fresh!! The broccoli makes you sing...and the wine noodles, make you cry. You leave with very weird mixed emotions, but mostly a happy belly full of yummy food.\n\nIn my opinion, this is the best dim sum I have been able to find in Phx. I'm ditching my previous spot (Mekong Palace) and will be back to Golden Buddha when the dim sum monster strikes again!"],"type":["Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low

Un-fresh and damn near flavorless all but for some powdery heat. Please invest in fresh chillies; they keep well and will make that \"8\" really pop with flavor.","I have been to this place this weekend with my fried family. We expected some authentic Indian style food. We ordered chicken biriyani, lamb biriyani, peas pulav and Chicken Pakora, Gulab jam. Biriyani was awful it's taste less. Full of racines. This restaurants is definitely not for South Indians. Maintainance and service was good but food is completely tasteless. Chicken pakora is at best. Papad is awesome. On Biriyani and pees pulav we Wasted money.","This place is terrible. Pittsburgh does not know how to make any food correct, let alone the complexity of Indian cuisine.  This city is the dumpster of the eastern U.S.  Do not go here, do not ever go to Pittsburgh.","I had high hopes for Taste of India, after reading the reviews, but I was not impressed. The food did not taste fresh (I had pakoras and an eggplant dish) and the rice was definitely old and crisp from sitting in the bottom of the cooker. I asked for spicy and my dish was quite mild. We were there toward the end of the night and the staff seemed resentful of our presence. As much as I love Indian food, I'll probably give Taste of India one more chance sometime, earlier in the evening. I hope to report back with at least one additional star.","The problem is inconsistency.  Sometimes a dish is very good, other times not so good.  Dal Makhni last night was like soup--all liquid, little dal. Lamb Curry lacked flavor when in the past it has been wonderful.  It appears that there are different cooks whose approach to dishes can be radically different.  I'd like to be able to count on a consistent product.","If you really know and like Indian cuisine then food here gonna be flavorless and bland for you. Tandoori chicken doesn't taste like one etc. Decor is tasteless and old. Carpet looks really dirty. I'm definitely not coming back.","Good, solid, and strangely inexpensive. \n\nWhile I didn't find Taste of India to be amazingly awesome, its currently in the running for my favorite Indian option in Pittsburgh. Service was fairly attentive, the naan was hot & crispy, and the chicken tikka was really tasty. \nA surprise: the veggie samosas have just a bit of spice-- unexpected and fun! Parking can be a challenge due to the location (directly across the street from Children's Hospital), but there are lots of meters around (and parking is free after 6pm).","Cozy and dim lighting. Food is okay - large quantities for take-out, watch out!","Friendly, kind staff and good service.  I'll go here again and again, for eat-in or take-out.  I don't really have any favorites here...everything is tasty!","Had a great experience here.  Service was super friendly and prompt.  The chicken tikka masala is excellent as well as the paneer naan.  I also tried the chicken curry, which used dark meat.  I thought it was just OK because of the poor quality of the chicken.  However, the curry was excellent.  I can't wait to go back!","The food is good, and excellently spiced.  Though others on this site have reported not being able to get dishes spicy enough, I've never had that problem (when I've ordered 10 out of 10, I got 10).  In fact, that's one of my favorite things about this restaurant: they cook the food exactly the way I want it, pretty consistently.  Sauces are creamy; meat is tender; and prices are reasonable.  I'd say this is easily one of the better Indian restaurants in the city, which is saying something given the plethora of good options.","I got with the tandoori dinner. 18$ for a full meal from appetizer to a nice small desert. Level 7 of spice, it was spicy but if you enjoy extra spicy kick it to a 10. The tandoori dinner was perfect size including the lamb saag I got as my 2nd meat pick. I also got king fisher Indian beer. A Good lager. It was a cold Monday night so I ended up eating my meal and chatting with the guy working the front of the house. It was rather nice since I went alone.\n\nIn the end good service and a relaxing meal with a nice hot cup of tea at the end.\n\nIt was all very good but I have had better lamb saag in the past.","I've drive by, seen the neon sign and the dark windows and have been very skeptical. But I finally went inside and it was delicious! Clean, yummy, and the BYOB!","I love this place! Its the best Indian food I've had in Pittsburgh! I absolutely love the chicken tikka masala, it is sooo good!! My boyfriend and I ordered take out once and I like spicy rating of 1 and he likes a 7 and when we got home and tried it they were both sevens. So if you're really sensitive like me, make sure to double check your order. I would definitely recommend Taste of India! I also really like all the vegetarian options!","Tried the vegetarian thali ($12ish) and was really impressed by the quality, variety, and spiciness to order.  Will head back here with a smile.","I have been really struggling to find a good indian place in Pittsburgh, since I moved back into town.  I ordered takeout from Taste of India, and it was ready very quickly (~15 minutes).  I ordered the Saag paneer, chicken tikka masala and an order of plain and garlic naan.  The naan was amazing!  My girlfriend who doesn't even really like Indian food loved the Chicken tikka masala, which was also really good.  The chicken was of really good quality and the sauce was delicious.  I also enjoyed the saag paneer, but probably not the best i've ever had.  Either way, the food was delicious and I will definitely go back!","Just moved from Pittsburgh and I miss Taste of India - this place is great.","Let me explain to you something. I didn't know, until I moved 12 hours away from here, what a magical place Taste of India really is. I also didn't know, that when I fly into Pittsburgh, I would directly be driving from the airport to pick up take out before seeing my family. Helllooo! Here is your daughter you haven't seen in over a year, she comes reeking of curries and spices every-single-time! \n\nCan we start with the fact that the service here is spectacular?! My friends and I have been coming here for years. The owners are cute and funny and we are terrors when we are there because we bring large parties and we are so excited to order an entire table of plates.\n\nWhat fills our table? \n\nBooze, yes, they have beer.\n\nBread: Chapatti (Yummy Whole Wheat Goodness!)\n\nVeggie Options:\nPaneer Jalferji (Cheese and Veg)\nDal Sag (Lentils)\nPaneer Makhni (Cheese and Peas)\nChana Masala (Duh)\n*Personal Fav: Malia Kofta (These little fried vegetable balls with creamy tomato sauce and almonds!) --Haven't found this one anywhere else as good as theirs! Ah! I am drooling thinking of it. \n\nWhat do they do to this freaking food? I just don't know. Go soon! Ask for spice level of 7-8 if you want to tantalize your taste-buds with some fiery food and if you would like to ship me a container of the Malia Kofta I will be more than happy to message you my address.....\n\n\nOh, and my favorite date in Pittsburgh? Taste of India and dancing at Brillo Box. So iconic. So Pittsburgh.","I have been to Taste of India several times, and every time they have never disappointed me. The service is great and the food is amazing. We were seated promptly, orders were taken, water replenished as soon as I was close to being empty and food came out right away. The food are delicious, proportioned and well priced. I always have the chicken tikka masala and butter chicken. I also had their garlic naan, beef and lamb curry. So if you're in the mood for some good Indian cuisine, Taste of India is a great choice.","There are two Indian restaurants pretty close to each other: Taste of India and People's. People's has better appetizers, and of course they have 1/2 off during certain hours, but Taste of India is better by far at entrees, and their masala tea is delicious. The nan is always hot, like hot hot, steaming hot, burn your hands hot, and perfectly done. \n\nChicken Tikka Masala leftovers are sitting in the fridge right now, calling my name. Everything is good and the portions are beyond generous. What is particularly striking is the pricing. Indian food in Orlando and DC tends to be expensive, and those are my frames of reference, but Taste of India is completely reasonable. Even bizarrely inexpensive considering the quality of the food you get.\n\nThe store front is odd, and the place never looks open, but don't be discouraged from going. Once you walk in you'll be seated quickly and served an onion and a mint chutney. Generally there is a young kid in the far back table playing on a computer or GameBoy.\n\nAt the end of the meal, your tip tray comes covered in an anise and sugar mixture with little pink, yellow, and white pellet things. I'm an addict, but always end up eating one pinch more than I ought, where the flavor becomes unappealing. And as much as I know this, I cannot help myself.","I asked the waitress what she recommended. She said they were all good and it's hard to make a decision. I was going to be the judge of that, and she was indeed telling the truth. So good!","Jordan & I have been eating Taste of India at CMU for a while, without knowing it was Taste of India.  At CMU they offer super inexpensive lunches that are more filling than anywhere else to eat at lunch. During this winter break, we have been going through some serious withdraw while the cafe is closed.\n\nThank you YELPERS once again, in our search to satiate our curry addiction, we have found our distributor!  We were excited to read that this restaurant supplied our weekly lunches and we ordered!!\n\nI ordered the Alu Matar Mushroom at a spicy rating of 3 (yes, I'm a sissy), but it was EXACTLY what I wanted!!  Jordan ordered Alu Gobhi which was cauliflower & potato at a spicy rating of 5.  We truly weren't sure how to scale our tolerance; but we decided that next time we could both go hotter.\n\nWe also can't wait to try the Lunch Buffet! We really wish we would have known that this existed during the week in between Christmas & New Years when we were fiending for Indian food.  Now that we know, I have no doubt we will soon become regulars.\n\nWe have also tried Tamarind in Oakland, but that place just made my mouth go numb after it was all said and done (and left me with an unpleasant digestion experience).  All of the bad cliche things you hear about Indian food, is nothing like Taste of India.  You can taste the love cooked in.","Buffet, while small is totally worth it. Has all the essentials!","Darren brought me here, and as a Indian food n00b, I was impressed with everything included in the economical Dinner for Two which gets a diner nan, a meat dish, a veggie dish, dal, a dessert, and tea. The tea and kheer was a nice way to cap off the meal. The mango beef and alu palak were superb. I could live on the bread alone. They look to have renovated the place, and Darren said the bathrooms were much nicer this time around.","Delicious food! The decor is a little lacking, but the food was so outstanding that I have to give it 5 stars. We had 3 types of bread, along with goat mango curry, chana masala, and chicken tikka masala. All of these were excellent, with fresh flavor and nuanced taste. We asked for a spice level of 8, and the spice was spot on.  Flavors were so without being muddled. \n\nI would definitely, definitely return next time I come to Pittsburgh.","This place knocked me out.\n\nI had garlic naan and the lamb Shahajahani.  The sauce was so good, I used all the naan to sop it up.  (The waiter told me it was OK to do that.  Not sure if it really was, but I don't care.  I wasn't gonna leave any.)\n\nI travel a lot, and enjoy finding little places like this that are inconspicuous, where you can get great food, great service at a really decent price.  I had what I described above, plus a half-carafe of their house wine (not spectacular, but who cares) for $29, tip included.  And it was a good tip.\n\nThe server was very friendly and helpful and took time to help select the best choice for what I was in the mood for.

waiter was to be found about ten minutes later they gave us our water and left again! It wasn't even busy! There were only TWO dim sum carts floating around somewhere. Then our waiter finally came around and took our orders of lunch entrees. The food was not even that good as the reviews that are posted on here. When we came up to pay, the bill was super overpriced. I will not be returning here, I am better off eating at Great Wall Cuisine.","If this place had zero stars I would have given them that ! Let me start off by saying I was so excited to read all great reviews so maybe I just came in on a off day? We walked in and were seated came over and asked if we wanted water or tea I guess they don't serve anything Else, Then we placed an order pork dumplings and sticky rice nasty! Then I asked if they served egg rolls they said they were out!!! they pushed their little carts around with hot plates that basically steam the food and is not fresh and what you get is soggy poor customer service we had to get up and look for someone to give us our tab so we could get the heck out of there are get some real food. It looked like it would be a great place for groups of people would not recommend if you are on mission for what you want and want to place an order but it could be a fun experience for some people.","You walk into a Chinese restaurant on a Saturday afternoon for dim sum and you expect the place to be PACKED.  Well, walking in to a pretty much empty dining room, it's a VERY CLEAR SIGN.  But my friend insisted and I was very hesitant for good reasons.  Another indicator, the majority of the patrons were NON Asian.  \n\nFood: You walk in and you see carts of the food by the entrance to the dining room.  Umm, I thought dim sum should come right off the steamer and into the carts and they roll it around, not sitting around.  The dim sum was garbage.  It had the typical selection, but at minimum.  \n\nService: It's ok.  But it doesn't make up for the horrible food.\n\nBottom line: NO WAY!  Stay away!","I've been here many times...Mother's Day with family, dim sum with book club, etc. But I will not go back again.  I stopped in to ask the owner about a donation or reduced price for a class of under-privileged kids that I volunteer with.  His reaction was to scoff and shoo me out the door while handing me his card and saying I could email him.  He turned his back and headed off to the messy newspaper-strewn table he haunts between guests arrivals.  Maybe he's a community-minded business owner, but then again, maybe he's not.  I'll be dining elsewhere.","Being from Chicago, we are used to getting authentic Chinese food all the time.  But when we first starting spending a lot of time in Scottsdale/Phoenix, we found it a challenge to get authentic Chinese food.  We were excited to find the Golden Buddha and have made many trips over the years all the way from the Troon North area to get our fix.  However, service has declined to the point where it is no longer worth the aggravation.  We went there last night for Chinese New Year and will never go back.  Granted they were very busy because of a lot of large tables there, but waiting almost an hour to get our food is not acceptable under any circumstance!  45 mins. into our wait, the waitress came back (after we flagged her down to ask about our food) and said one of the dishes we ordered was not available....after 45 mins.!!!! What makes the whole experience an unforgivable one is that the manager/owner is so indifferent and never apologized or offered a discount off the bill...nothing.  When we left, the same manager was at the piano singing in Chinese. Huh?  Other than Nee House in Scottsdale, the search goes on for a restaurant that serves authentic Chinese food closer to home.","I will NEVER go there again.  I reserved a table for a group of 16 people for 5:00 PM on Christmas Eve .  The person on the phone ( I believe the manager) repeatedly asked me to call ahead and give him an accurate head count since he said they'd be swamped that day.  I followed up with him twice.  \nWhen the first couple of us arrived, we had menus shoved in our faces immediately and told we \"Must order now.  Must order now\" because they were going to be busy later on.  The place was practically empty.  As each person arrived, they were treated the same way. \nWe rushed and placed our orders and then they brought out our checks WAY before we saw any sign of our food.  I have never in my life been treated so rudely by a restaurant.\nIt was utter chaos when the food started coming out while everyone struggled to get the correct dish they ordered.  One person didn't get her food until we were all just about finished eating. \nOne top of all that, the food wasn't even good.  I've had better Kung Pao Chicken at Panda Express!\nAfter being rushed through our meal, the place wasn't even half full by the time we left.  I thought being at the Cultural Center, this restaurant would be a sure thing but boy was I wrong.  Lovely way to spend Christmas Eve..","If you are looking a chinese restaurant to host a big party look some other than the Golden Buddah.  I recently attended a banquet at the Golden Buddah and I was shocked at the level of quality of food and service.  Of the 10 dishes served 4 were nearly inedible.  \n\nThere was a crab claw appetizer, most chinese restaurants prepare this dish by taking a crab claw surrounding it with ground shrimp, batter and then deep fry.  At Golden Buddah, the crab claw served was mostly batter.  \n\nThe shark fin soup served was mostly broth.  Shark fin is an expensive ingredient and most places usually use imitation shark fin, but come on at least put something in there so that I know I'm eating soup and not dirty sink water.  \n\nGinger scallion lobster is battered, fried, and then stir fried in a sauce with ginger and scallions.  The ginger scallion lobster served was over-cooked and dried out.  \n\nLastly, there was a steamed fish.  The fish was raw in the middle.   \n\nIt wasn't all bad, there was a crispy chicken with garlic dish that was pretty good, but out of 10 dishes 4 were bad, 5 were okay, and 1 was good.  \n\nDoes 4 bad dishes out of 10 warrant a one star rating?  Well it does when you factor in the service.  The soup, appetizer, and first entree arrived timely, but after that there was a 1 hour gap before we received the next dish.  The dishes were not served with accompanying white rice which I thought was odd.  We had to ask for it, and even the rice took a while to arrive.","I agree with Crystal C., that the dim sum isn't the greatest I've ever had. In fact, I am not sure if the meal was so tasty that it was memorable. I do remember the \"calamari\" was not really calamari, like you would think. It was presented more like a sweet and sour pork (so calamari with LOTS of breading) without any sauce. As a result, the dish was dry and salty.\n\nThe sticky rice was good (hard to mess up), the chicken feet were okay (needed more five spice powder), and the shumai was alright. The noodles were good, and I can see why the cart ran out after the first round. The diners were an equal mix of Asians and Americans. I would've preferred to see more Asians eating (as I am used to in a Chinatown and gives an indication of authenticity), but I do realize we're in Phoenix where the Asian population is not like San Francisco or Houston. \n\nThe meal came to about $30 for two, including jasmine tea. The carts are loud because they are made out of metal and roll on tile. I am also not used to staff members shouting what they have in their cart, like a newspaper boy yelling \"Extra! Extra!\" Christmas music was playing after mid-January, so the atmosphere felt strange. Next time I visit the city, I probably will pass.","Can't say that I was very impressed. Came for dinner in a hopeful and enthusiastic mood since the reviews have been pretty good, but I don't think this place lives up to its current good, but declining rating.\n\nOrdered the Combo fried rice (shrimp, chicken, beef, pork), sesame chicken, and garlic fried chicken. \n\nThe combo fried rice was pretty good, but ended up drinking about 6 glasses of water due to the MSG and sodium content. You'd think that the cook spent his better years in the French Foreign Legion in the Sahara eating salt tablets and developed a taste for them. \n\nThe sesame chicken had a good flavor and a thick brown sweet sauce. I liked it a lot until it got cool and the sauce looked (with that stringy consistency) more like glue. You think I'm kidding? I'm not.\n\nGarlic fried chicken was bad. Just bad. It was like an over roasted dried out half chicken with some dried garlic pieces sprinkled on top. No spices, no flavor, no good. \n\nWe then got all kinds of lip from the waitress when we asked if they could change the channel on the TV from college football, to the Suns game. They made it into this big deal that the \"customers\" wanted to see the football game. Yeah right, it was University of West Virginia Vs. University of Connecticut! I would have believed it if it was a local team....\n\nIt's better than a 1 star joint, but only because it's borderline edible. To be avoided.","This restaurant is located in the Chinese Cultural Center and was the one restaurant that I had not been to. So after some shopping at one of the shops, we stepped in to have dinner.\n\nWe stepped in and asked for a seat for two. We were seated immediately. The place was decorated nicely and a lady playing the piano made for great ambiance.\n\nWe looked at the menu briefly and ordered our drinks, an appetizer, a soup and two main dishes. The drinks came out promptly and so did the rest of the meal. My goodness everything we ordered was very tasty.\n\nThe waiter service itself however was not even close to the decor and food. He never introduced himself, and although he took our order, our food itself was brought out by a kitchen person.\n\nAfter we ordered our waiter really never came back asking if we needed anything else, except to give us our check at the end and that was after the person I was dining with got up and asked a different waiter for it.\n\nIt's amazing how a place with great food, decor, and ambiance can mess it all up by crappy waiter service.","I love Dim Sum, my favorite Chinese dish.\n\nWhen Golden Buddha first open, they have excellent Dim sum. I went there many times, I tell my friend how good it is, But now,  they change cook, taste more like  week old left over. Rumor has it, they change cook every few month, so Quality of cooking change. (not sure if that is true, but that is what I was told.)\nMy advice is; when you walk in the door and the place is pack, = Good Cook. if the place is bare = bad cook. leave immediately. don't waste your money.","If you just \"want\" dim sum, go here. If you are \"craving\" dim sum, go elsewhere (take a 5 hour drive west to neighboring state, California).\n\nAnyway, I've been visiting Golden Buddha in the noontime for roughly 2 years now. I believe they moved from their original site (7th St. & Osborn), formerly \"China Doll.\" Relocation brought along better atmosphere and smiling faces. This does not mean, better dim sum. But since we are in Phoenix, I will settle for what they have to offer. \n\nBe mindful of the dim sum tab. It's itemized high-medium-low. \n\nShaomai can be found as combinations of pork/mushroom, shrimp, or shark fin (which should not be confused as true shark bits, as the shaomai is prepared to look like a shark's fin). These picks are okay...perhaps on a better day shao mai will be served in less-rigid, or fresher wrappers. Potstickers are okay as well, just the usual scallion and pork, and dry wrapper. The baby pork ribs in light black bean sauce and jalapenos is alright, but sometimes lacks in taste. Tripe is also served in its bare minimum...so if you enjoy the texture and flavor of tripe, try this with its clear sauce and thinly sliced carrots and celery.  \nBuche (that's what I call it), or fried sesame balls are also available, although if you wait until dessert, they will also be a bit stiff. There are a few other things that may be \"spotted\" but are not worth mentioning. \n\nDon't order from their lunch menu, as you can find these over-salted dishes at Panda Express anyway. \n\nOverall, dim sum at Golden Buddha is a place to go if you are around the vicinity and feel like having something apart from the usual fast food. However, discriminating palates- beware.","Not impressed with this place at all. This was not the friendliest place around, maybe because of the language barrier (most or all were clearly native Chinese speakers), or maybe just the attitude of the employees.\n\nI ordered the sweet and sour chicken lunch, which came with the typical egg drop soup, crab rangoon, and egg roll. The soup was ok - maybe it's just me, but I prefer a real spoon to the scoop that they gave me. The egg roll was tiny and not that great, and the crab rangoon was ok, but maybe a little undercooked. The chicken wasn't bad, but nothing special, as was the rice and other stuff on the plate.\n\nOverall, this was just not my kind of Chinese place.","Disappointing.  Mediocre at best.  I am staying at the Aloft hotel in phoenix and ordered some delivery. I ordered a couple american chinese food staples: general tso's chicken, dumplings and hot&sour soup.  Soup had zero flavor, dumplings tasted freezer burned and processed.  General tso chicken was ehh. \n\nA lot of good reviews on here so it must be for eat in and for their dim sum.  Don't order delivery, you will be left hungry and unsatisfied.","Went there on Saturday for early lunch.  My wife did the dim sum, it was okay, we were both disgusted by the sugar cane shrimp; but the rest was good.  \n\nI ordered the chicken szechwuan, the waitress warned me it was \"spicy\" the reason I ordered it.  It came out delicious, but not what I would call spicy.  Overall its hard to find good Chinese in the valley and I would call this good without hesitation.","So I was referred to this place from the front desk of my hotel. I'm from SF so I'm coming from a place with really good chinese food. \n\nThe dim sum is just \"ok\" nothing for me to write home about. The one dish that I really liked was the chinese broccoli cooked with garlic sauce. Yum yum yum.  It's in a big bowl, not oily, not saucy, just really good. I think it's $7.50.  \n\nIt's a somewhat pricey and just like all chinese restaurants, it's not the cleanest.  The chair was filthy.  the dishes weren't all that great.  I wouldn't go back unless I want the chinese broccoli.  \n\nSo I went on a Sunday and it was not crowded at all. There's not a huge asian population  in Phoenix (not that I could tell) so I don't think there's a high demand for dim sum.  And also, I sooooooo felt like taking a pic of this, but a Mexican lady was pushing one of the dim sum carts. That is unheard of in SF.  This is a mainly mandarin restaurant and the dim sum places I go are usually cantonese.  Not a big deal though since the dishes look the same. \n\nDude, there was a turtle in the fish tank that I saw as I left.  I hope they don't eat that!","A Premier Chinese Atmosphere,\nThe Chinese cultural center and Asian Garden produces an Asain atmosphere that can be recognized from the 202.  \n With Dim Sum served this location earns its respect from the local community.\n\nDim Sum tip,  You have to be smart with the Dim Sum ladies they look nice innocent but they are professional sales people that will sell you more dishes than you need before you know what to do.  \n\nI love the desserts here ask the server to see the dessert tray.","This restaurant has a bit of an identity crisis. It is in the Chinese cultural center, but serves Japanese beer (Kirin on tap!) and the live piano music is American pop. We had to ask for chopsticks.\n\nHaving said that, the service was professional. Our waiter held a hot appetizer for one of our party who was away from the table so that it would not be cold when he returned. We were asked frequently--and not too frequently--if things were ok both by our waiter and the manager/proprietor.\n\nThe food was ok-to-good. Fried shrimp egg rolls were dainty but yummy. Duck was tasty but very chewy. Kung-pao chicken was pleasantly spiced. Plenty of rice. A pitcher of ice water with lemon was left at the table. \n\nAtmosphere was also pleasant. Chairs comfortable, tables spaced well, restrooms large and clean...and there is indeed a large golden Buddha by the entrance.","I took a group of friends here and relatives other times. The place is consistently good for Dim-sum during lunch. It is typical Chinese and nothing fancy.\n\nWhat helps this place is the moat scenery.  3 stars for visiting here based on convenience since there are similar places in town.","Having grown up in Hong Kong and having eaten dim sum in London, NY, LA, SF and Vancouver (actually Richmond), I can confidently say I know my dim sum.\n\nGood selection of well-executed dim sum when the carts actually come around and there's anything left in it.  I'd give it 4 stars for food but the wait definitely detracted from the whole experience.\n\nI think the problem with Golden Buddha is that they can't handle the heavy flow on weekends.  There's not enough regular dim sum eaters like LA that can sustain a steady flow of diners throughout the week, forcing restaurants like Golden Buddha to depend heavily on extra part-time help on weekends.  \n\nDim sum takes serious skill so the chef still ends up doing most of the work.  When we looked into the kitchen, we saw a Chinese woman doing most of the cooking herself.  No wonder it took forever for a cart to come out and when it does, it's swarmed on by a pack of vultures.\n\nIf you're willing to eat at a more simply decorated place with a smaller menu, I'd highly recommend China Chan.  It's much more relaxed - usually no wait on weekends.  An experienced chef makes all the dim sum himself so the menu's much shorter but all the classics are on it.  Anything steamed is made to order so is very fresh.","Situated in the Chinese Cultural Center near the SkyHarbor Airport, this was another pleasant find. All I had was the Dim Sum menu, and I would say this is the best you're gonna get in Phoenix. Still worth the stop to get your Dim Sum fix. The cart ladies were pleasant and very happy to converse with me in Cantonese. Only downside was the chicken sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaves, naw mei gai, was way overcooked, and mushy.","Do you want to eat Chinese Food in an elegant environment on a Friday night in Phoenix? \n\nBe entertained by classic, quiet standards being played live on a piano while you dine?\n\nAre you 50 years old and Caucasian?\n\nThen the Golden Buddha is the place for you! \n\nIts in the Chinese Cultural Center Mall on 44th, and a popular weekend spot for Dim Sum. For a DIm Sum starved Valley of the Sun, Golden Buddha's is decent. \n\nFor dinner, though, it is awfully Americanized and not very authentic Chinese. But with a bunch of American customers coming for dinner, what do you expect? They probably think they are getting \"real Chinese\" food by going to the Chinese Mall, but then again, they are used to PF Chang's or Stix normally in their neighborhood, so this is a step up.\n\nThe best thing about this place is the decor, which is clean and nice, with a Hong Kong Junk boat design covering the ceiling from the bar into the dining room. The next best thing is the Piano interludes on weekend nights. The service is next, which is a little overly eager to remove your plate, and the last thing is the food. \n\nThey do give decent portions. I ordered Guo Teh (potstickers) and got 6 fat ones. But they weren't served with the usual soy, chili oil and vinegar, but a soy and green onions mixture. The Mapo Tofu was ok, as they used a nice silky tofu, which was nice, but no green onions, and sliced black mushrooms instead, which I like, but not in this dish.\n\nCome here for the ambiance and music in the evenings, or on the weekend days for Dim Sum.","Decent dim sum, especially to be found in the middle of the desert. Sadly, the best food I've had in Phoenix.","This place is a little difficult for me to review.  I was staying at the Hampton Inn across the street and this is the closest restaurant so off I went.\n\nI walked in and the owner or manager met me at the door and asked \"how many\"?\n\nI told him I wanted to order take out and handed me a menu and pointed to the waiting area which was covered in newspapers.  I chose to go to the bar, order a glass of wine, and peruse the menu.\n\nThe drinks are expensive but I didn't think the food was.  Less than $10 for my Mongolian Chicken which came with white sticky rice and a fortune cookie.  When ordering I asked if I could have fried rice instead of white rice but was told \"no\".  Most places allow this for a nominal fee.\n\nFine by me.  Give the white rice.  Food was prepared and their to-go boxes were a lot better than the standard white Chinese \"to go\" boxes.  They also included the plastic-ware, napkin, and soy sauce, which a lot of places forget.\n\nLooking around I found a whole lot of goodness along with a couple disappointments.  Most notably the newspaper strewn about and behind the bar, to the right were a lot of boxes stacked in an unsightly fashion.  I could have been a little more presentable in my opinion.\n\nI peeked into the dining room because I wanted to see if the piano music was piped in or live.  It was live which was very nice. Also, the dinning room looked very nice and cozy.\n\nAs I was leaving the same man who greeted me upon entering made sure to wish me a good evening.  My initial impression of the man was that he was surly and testy but that's just how he comes off.\n\nThe food was very good.  The Mongolian sauce was mixture of sweet with spice and the chicken and vegetables all tasted fresh.","My husband and I went there Saturday, the service was great!  Our friends were going to be late so they told us to start.  And start we did!\nThey were serving Dim Sum, something we had never tried, so glad we did, it was wonderful, hubby wouldn't do the chicken feet, but I think next time I will, it looked very good.\nOur friends showed up and ordered their food, and ate all of it, they said that usually they take food home, but it was so good they had to eat all of it!\nWe will be going back very soon!","Let's see, over 50... check \nold white man...........check \neats dinner ...............check \nlistens to the piano  check \n\nwow this must be the place for me, I mean after all it is in a Chinese mall, no make that a Chinese Cultural Center. How could I possibly have discerning taste with such trickery to get me here to eat. \nDude if you are going to rate a restaurant no need to degrade others with your arrogance. \nFool is my review of wanugee N. \n\nNow on the restaurant. The last time we were here the food was not good, the piano was too loud and the waitress had a real attitude. IT won't keep me from going back as I have had good meals and wait service too. \n\nBack to wanugee N. I do not expect any place in Phx. to have authentic Chinese food, by that I mean the street food one finds in China. \nBut I do expect what I fork in to my mouth is worth what I am going to fork over in cost. Even an old white guy like me can tell the difference between good and bad food. No matter what it is called.","Okay so Ive been glum the past few days as I have an impending birthday. Every year this time I get all down in the dumps.. not that I'm not happy with my life cause life is good. Its more like getting further away from my youth and closer to being well, old. All of my grandparents were crotchety, sourpuss drama queens.. is that my fate? Can I break the mold or am I to going to be a crotchety sourpuss?\n\nSo as I contemplate and figure out what I'm going to do with my birthday baggage I decide to squash it with food. All weekend Ive been eating out and having a good time. This is one of the few times outside of a vacation where I will live it completely and to the near of sheer gluttony. So why not dim sum? \n\nIve chowed much dim sum in my 36 years of earthen wear.. of course some good and some bad. I have never been to a place where every dish was great.. Golden Buddha is no exception to this.. they do the basics well enough and have enough funky cool Asian style to keep me interested in returning. The carts around 1130 flow well but around noon it' s full blown freeway action! In fact there might be some road kill in there based on some of the looks on that last steam cart.. \n\nMe and 3 others who were feeling my pain ordered 14, count them, 14 different dishes. One of my friends is from Georgia and had never had dim sum but he is so courageous and unflinching that he was just a blast. Just the shot in the arm to get me out of my funk. I remember the first time I had dim sum.. my eyes wide open, nostrils flared and excited to see what was under the next steamer lid. That was him today.. one exciting thing after the next.. he was even willing to try chicken feet but this is one of those dishes not done very well here. \n\nMy friend took me back to a time where I was younger and less experienced. He looked up to me to guide him through the noodles, bao and sui mai.. like a big brother.. I'm privileged that I could show him something new and exciting and he was so into it! So instead of feeling sorry for myself I felt experienced and useful.. that there is something I can give back to others.. that its not all about me and me aging but about what can be shared with others.\n\nThere is so much more to do, give and feel in this short time we are here.. and Ill do it to, one bite at a time.","The best to be found in land locked Arizona.  My favorite sticky rice is here.  They have dim sum every day, but not a huge selection, though you can order off the menu.  I think it is much bigger on the weekends.  I'm just happy I can get my fix 7 days a week.  Beautiful gardens to walk through, with fish ponds, and a 99 market next door!","I ate at Golden Buddha a few weeks ago.  We ate at the restaurant after a day at the zoo with our 4 year old and had a blast.  The piano bar played tunes for my daughter and the staff was more than accommodating.  The general tso chicken was better than anything I can get in Tucson.  The soup was chocked full of fresh, read FRESH, not canned, vegetables.  All in all, I was very satisfied with the meal and the service.  Plus the decor is very nice, clean and cheery. \n\nEat at Golden Buddha.","For those who gave this place low marks, forgive me. I really like this place. Now I haven't tried various dim sum places so I'm reserving the right to downgrade the place as needed. The variety of food is plentiful, and the carts just keep on coming. I love the steamed pork buns, and the shiu mai (not sure if I spelled that correctly). Yesterday, my favorite pick was the deep fried rolls of taro and shrimp. YUM! I have never ordered from their menu so I can only talk about their dim sum. My friends and I try to go eat dim sum almost every Sunday. It's a cheap way to try new foods, and if you don't like it, well.. you can get away with pushing it aside with minimal guilt. Give it a try! You might be surprised.","I like Golden Buddha, have taken many friends there for Dim Sum.  \nTry not to \"hit\" the dumpling cart to heavy; otherwise cannot finish it to the dessert cart (LOL).\nLove the jasmine tea and the staff willing to help you if you do not understand the what each item is.\nSingapore Rice Noodles a favorite, along with any of the shrimp dumplings; also the broccoli and green beans.\nOnly wish that the carts with eggplant stuffed with shrimp or green peppers with shrimp were not on \"heated\" carts; by the time it gets to you the food is cold.\nOnly concern is that went on 22MAY2010 at 1:30PM; there was a closed sign due to electricity???\nREVISED: 26MAY2010 - called this evening - looks like they are back open again.","I've been to the Golden Buddha on several occasions and it is my favorite, by far, for honest Chinese food. \nWhile I've sampled everything from their vegetarian to their beef, I love their mandarin chicken. More recently, I was delighted to relive the wonders of their Kung Pao Chicken and Beef with Broccoli. \nI absolutely love the egg drop soup and mini crab rangoons that come with the meal.","The very first time I went to Golden Buddha was with my BFF and it was our first dim sum experience. Little did I know this would forever change my life and eating experiences. Although I must admit that first time was a bit awkward.\n\nGB wisely takes reservations which was wonderful (even though it wasn't crazy busy). Our assorted dim sum plates were flavorful and fresh. And the carts seemed to be in constant rotation so we were never too far from a good selection.\n\nWhat really helps GB is its location. The Cofco Center is an experience in itself, where one can have herbs specially blended, select a fresh member of marine life to take home and cook or browse through a store with one of the largest selections of Buddhas and hand fans I've experienced outside of San Francisco.","I've been to Golden Buddha a few times and have not been disappointed. \n\nThey have a LARGE selection of Dim Sum and if you're not careful you can get carried away.\n\nTry and get there early and you'll get the best and most fresh selection.\nMake sure you walk around the garden when you're done.","Probably the most comprehensive Chinese menu in the Valley.  Pick from well over 100 dishes, but if you want the best order the Peking Duck.  Everything else is very good, but without a wow factor.  You'll see lots of Chinese people in this massive restaurant, which probably means they're doing a fine job in the kitchen.","I very much enjoyed eating here. Food was great. Fairly fast service. Wasn't expensive either for the 4 of us.","Golden Buddha has GREAT dim sum.  Their prices are reasonable and the staff is very polite wheeling their little carts.  I tend to go on the weekend because there is more selection but they do dim sum throughout the week.  They also have some very authentic dishes on the menu for those who are more of the adventurous types.  Be sure to say hello to the turtles the next time you go.","This place in the Chinese Cultural Center has a very pretty and elegant bar area. I was pleased to learn that they had some very reasonable and delicious happy hour snacks. This is a good place for a Pina Colada. I had one by myself along with some dumplings and fried shrimp appetizer. Sadly I never brought anyone else here with me. It was happy hour heaven but you know? A lot of my friends in AZ pretty much hang out in one neighborhood or another and nobody I know really lives close to the Buddha.\nThe airport is pretty close by. This might be a good pre-flight send-off location.","I have had dim sum in New Orleans and Phoenix (not SF), and this is about equal to the best of New Orleans as far as flavor.\nAs for ambiance, today was a good day. I've had dim sum here about a dozen times, and have had very good service and quality 90% of the time, including weekends. I have had bad days here, but since today was good, I'll rate accordingly. It's closer to a 4.5, but since I can't give half-stars, I rounded up.\nDon't expect me to give these the right names, but... I was less than impressed with the bbq pork balls. They tasted too much like honey and the beef was minimal. The bbq sauce tasted bottled. Outside of that, their herbal hot tea is delicious even on a hot day.\nThe shu mai were very good, and the shrimp in a spinach dumpling was fantastic. A definite don't miss is their sticky rice in lotus leaf. It's among the best I've had anywhere. Just be careful; you'll find bones in it every once in a while. Go for any of their steamed dumplings; they're very flavorful. As others have said, I love the Chinese broccoli, but you'll only find it on the carts on weekends. Otherwise order it off the menu.\nToday (11:30 lunch) the carts came around often, and everything except the pork buns was piping hot and fresh. By the way, despite the price increases, even the sticky rice was considered a medium size entree, and the two of us eating there escaped with a bill under $20 and we were done in under 30 minutes.\nI strongly recommend the dim sum here, whether you've had it a million times or have never had it before. You usually won't be disappointed.","I don't really understand the poor reviews on this place.....maybe it depends on the day you go? We went on a Sunday, it was crazy busy, but service was great! (of course, my view of customer service is a little different then the rest... I used to live on an island where you were just happy to find what you were looking for, let alone expect good customer service) Anyways, our server was very sweet! Always had a smile on her face. The carts served us promplty and none of the food was cold. They always had whatever we wanted (I hate having to wait for the next cart).\n\nNow, as for the actual dim sum and food.......holy cow, to die for! So flavorful and fresh!! The broccoli makes you sing...and the wine noodles, make you cry. You leave with very weird mixed emotions, but mostly a happy belly full of yummy food.\n\nIn my opinion, this is the best dim sum I have been able to find in Phx. I'm ditching my previous spot (Mekong Palace) and will be back to Golden Buddha when the dim sum monster strikes again!"],"type":["Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low

waiter was to be found about ten minutes later they gave us our water and left again! It wasn't even busy! There were only TWO dim sum carts floating around somewhere. Then our waiter finally came around and took our orders of lunch entrees. The food was not even that good as the reviews that are posted on here. When we came up to pay, the bill was super overpriced. I will not be returning here, I am better off eating at Great Wall Cuisine.","If this place had zero stars I would have given them that ! Let me start off by saying I was so excited to read all great reviews so maybe I just came in on a off day? We walked in and were seated came over and asked if we wanted water or tea I guess they don't serve anything Else, Then we placed an order pork dumplings and sticky rice nasty! Then I asked if they served egg rolls they said they were out!!! they pushed their little carts around with hot plates that basically steam the food and is not fresh and what you get is soggy poor customer service we had to get up and look for someone to give us our tab so we could get the heck out of there are get some real food. It looked like it would be a great place for groups of people would not recommend if you are on mission for what you want and want to place an order but it could be a fun experience for some people.","You walk into a Chinese restaurant on a Saturday afternoon for dim sum and you expect the place to be PACKED.  Well, walking in to a pretty much empty dining room, it's a VERY CLEAR SIGN.  But my friend insisted and I was very hesitant for good reasons.  Another indicator, the majority of the patrons were NON Asian.  \n\nFood: You walk in and you see carts of the food by the entrance to the dining room.  Umm, I thought dim sum should come right off the steamer and into the carts and they roll it around, not sitting around.  The dim sum was garbage.  It had the typical selection, but at minimum.  \n\nService: It's ok.  But it doesn't make up for the horrible food.\n\nBottom line: NO WAY!  Stay away!","I've been here many times...Mother's Day with family, dim sum with book club, etc. But I will not go back again.  I stopped in to ask the owner about a donation or reduced price for a class of under-privileged kids that I volunteer with.  His reaction was to scoff and shoo me out the door while handing me his card and saying I could email him.  He turned his back and headed off to the messy newspaper-strewn table he haunts between guests arrivals.  Maybe he's a community-minded business owner, but then again, maybe he's not.  I'll be dining elsewhere.","Being from Chicago, we are used to getting authentic Chinese food all the time.  But when we first starting spending a lot of time in Scottsdale/Phoenix, we found it a challenge to get authentic Chinese food.  We were excited to find the Golden Buddha and have made many trips over the years all the way from the Troon North area to get our fix.  However, service has declined to the point where it is no longer worth the aggravation.  We went there last night for Chinese New Year and will never go back.  Granted they were very busy because of a lot of large tables there, but waiting almost an hour to get our food is not acceptable under any circumstance!  45 mins. into our wait, the waitress came back (after we flagged her down to ask about our food) and said one of the dishes we ordered was not available....after 45 mins.!!!! What makes the whole experience an unforgivable one is that the manager/owner is so indifferent and never apologized or offered a discount off the bill...nothing.  When we left, the same manager was at the piano singing in Chinese. Huh?  Other than Nee House in Scottsdale, the search goes on for a restaurant that serves authentic Chinese food closer to home.","I will NEVER go there again.  I reserved a table for a group of 16 people for 5:00 PM on Christmas Eve .  The person on the phone ( I believe the manager) repeatedly asked me to call ahead and give him an accurate head count since he said they'd be swamped that day.  I followed up with him twice.  \nWhen the first couple of us arrived, we had menus shoved in our faces immediately and told we \"Must order now.  Must order now\" because they were going to be busy later on.  The place was practically empty.  As each person arrived, they were treated the same way. \nWe rushed and placed our orders and then they brought out our checks WAY before we saw any sign of our food.  I have never in my life been treated so rudely by a restaurant.\nIt was utter chaos when the food started coming out while everyone struggled to get the correct dish they ordered.  One person didn't get her food until we were all just about finished eating. \nOne top of all that, the food wasn't even good.  I've had better Kung Pao Chicken at Panda Express!\nAfter being rushed through our meal, the place wasn't even half full by the time we left.  I thought being at the Cultural Center, this restaurant would be a sure thing but boy was I wrong.  Lovely way to spend Christmas Eve..","If you are looking a chinese restaurant to host a big party look some other than the Golden Buddah.  I recently attended a banquet at the Golden Buddah and I was shocked at the level of quality of food and service.  Of the 10 dishes served 4 were nearly inedible.  \n\nThere was a crab claw appetizer, most chinese restaurants prepare this dish by taking a crab claw surrounding it with ground shrimp, batter and then deep fry.  At Golden Buddah, the crab claw served was mostly batter.  \n\nThe shark fin soup served was mostly broth.  Shark fin is an expensive ingredient and most places usually use imitation shark fin, but come on at least put something in there so that I know I'm eating soup and not dirty sink water.  \n\nGinger scallion lobster is battered, fried, and then stir fried in a sauce with ginger and scallions.  The ginger scallion lobster served was over-cooked and dried out.  \n\nLastly, there was a steamed fish.  The fish was raw in the middle.   \n\nIt wasn't all bad, there was a crispy chicken with garlic dish that was pretty good, but out of 10 dishes 4 were bad, 5 were okay, and 1 was good.  \n\nDoes 4 bad dishes out of 10 warrant a one star rating?  Well it does when you factor in the service.  The soup, appetizer, and first entree arrived timely, but after that there was a 1 hour gap before we received the next dish.  The dishes were not served with accompanying white rice which I thought was odd.  We had to ask for it, and even the rice took a while to arrive.","I agree with Crystal C., that the dim sum isn't the greatest I've ever had. In fact, I am not sure if the meal was so tasty that it was memorable. I do remember the \"calamari\" was not really calamari, like you would think. It was presented more like a sweet and sour pork (so calamari with LOTS of breading) without any sauce. As a result, the dish was dry and salty.\n\nThe sticky rice was good (hard to mess up), the chicken feet were okay (needed more five spice powder), and the shumai was alright. The noodles were good, and I can see why the cart ran out after the first round. The diners were an equal mix of Asians and Americans. I would've preferred to see more Asians eating (as I am used to in a Chinatown and gives an indication of authenticity), but I do realize we're in Phoenix where the Asian population is not like San Francisco or Houston. \n\nThe meal came to about $30 for two, including jasmine tea. The carts are loud because they are made out of metal and roll on tile. I am also not used to staff members shouting what they have in their cart, like a newspaper boy yelling \"Extra! Extra!\" Christmas music was playing after mid-January, so the atmosphere felt strange. Next time I visit the city, I probably will pass.","Can't say that I was very impressed. Came for dinner in a hopeful and enthusiastic mood since the reviews have been pretty good, but I don't think this place lives up to its current good, but declining rating.\n\nOrdered the Combo fried rice (shrimp, chicken, beef, pork), sesame chicken, and garlic fried chicken. \n\nThe combo fried rice was pretty good, but ended up drinking about 6 glasses of water due to the MSG and sodium content. You'd think that the cook spent his better years in the French Foreign Legion in the Sahara eating salt tablets and developed a taste for them. \n\nThe sesame chicken had a good flavor and a thick brown sweet sauce. I liked it a lot until it got cool and the sauce looked (with that stringy consistency) more like glue. You think I'm kidding? I'm not.\n\nGarlic fried chicken was bad. Just bad. It was like an over roasted dried out half chicken with some dried garlic pieces sprinkled on top. No spices, no flavor, no good. \n\nWe then got all kinds of lip from the waitress when we asked if they could change the channel on the TV from college football, to the Suns game. They made it into this big deal that the \"customers\" wanted to see the football game. Yeah right, it was University of West Virginia Vs. University of Connecticut! I would have believed it if it was a local team....\n\nIt's better than a 1 star joint, but only because it's borderline edible. To be avoided.","This restaurant is located in the Chinese Cultural Center and was the one restaurant that I had not been to. So after some shopping at one of the shops, we stepped in to have dinner.\n\nWe stepped in and asked for a seat for two. We were seated immediately. The place was decorated nicely and a lady playing the piano made for great ambiance.\n\nWe looked at the menu briefly and ordered our drinks, an appetizer, a soup and two main dishes. The drinks came out promptly and so did the rest of the meal. My goodness everything we ordered was very tasty.\n\nThe waiter service itself however was not even close to the decor and food. He never introduced himself, and although he took our order, our food itself was brought out by a kitchen person.\n\nAfter we ordered our waiter really never came back asking if we needed anything else, except to give us our check at the end and that was after the person I was dining with got up and asked a different waiter for it.\n\nIt's amazing how a place with great food, decor, and ambiance can mess it all up by crappy waiter service.","I love Dim Sum, my favorite Chinese dish.\n\nWhen Golden Buddha first open, they have excellent Dim sum. I went there many times, I tell my friend how good it is, But now,  they change cook, taste more like  week old left over. Rumor has it, they change cook every few month, so Quality of cooking change. (not sure if that is true, but that is what I was told.)\nMy advice is; when you walk in the door and the place is pack, = Good Cook. if the place is bare = bad cook. leave immediately. don't waste your money.","If you just \"want\" dim sum, go here. If you are \"craving\" dim sum, go elsewhere (take a 5 hour drive west to neighboring state, California).\n\nAnyway, I've been visiting Golden Buddha in the noontime for roughly 2 years now. I believe they moved from their original site (7th St. & Osborn), formerly \"China Doll.\" Relocation brought along better atmosphere and smiling faces. This does not mean, better dim sum. But since we are in Phoenix, I will settle for what they have to offer. \n\nBe mindful of the dim sum tab. It's itemized high-medium-low. \n\nShaomai can be found as combinations of pork/mushroom, shrimp, or shark fin (which should not be confused as true shark bits, as the shaomai is prepared to look like a shark's fin). These picks are okay...perhaps on a better day shao mai will be served in less-rigid, or fresher wrappers. Potstickers are okay as well, just the usual scallion and pork, and dry wrapper. The baby pork ribs in light black bean sauce and jalapenos is alright, but sometimes lacks in taste. Tripe is also served in its bare minimum...so if you enjoy the texture and flavor of tripe, try this with its clear sauce and thinly sliced carrots and celery.  \nBuche (that's what I call it), or fried sesame balls are also available, although if you wait until dessert, they will also be a bit stiff. There are a few other things that may be \"spotted\" but are not worth mentioning. \n\nDon't order from their lunch menu, as you can find these over-salted dishes at Panda Express anyway. \n\nOverall, dim sum at Golden Buddha is a place to go if you are around the vicinity and feel like having something apart from the usual fast food. However, discriminating palates- beware.","Not impressed with this place at all. This was not the friendliest place around, maybe because of the language barrier (most or all were clearly native Chinese speakers), or maybe just the attitude of the employees.\n\nI ordered the sweet and sour chicken lunch, which came with the typical egg drop soup, crab rangoon, and egg roll. The soup was ok - maybe it's just me, but I prefer a real spoon to the scoop that they gave me. The egg roll was tiny and not that great, and the crab rangoon was ok, but maybe a little undercooked. The chicken wasn't bad, but nothing special, as was the rice and other stuff on the plate.\n\nOverall, this was just not my kind of Chinese place.","Disappointing.  Mediocre at best.  I am staying at the Aloft hotel in phoenix and ordered some delivery. I ordered a couple american chinese food staples: general tso's chicken, dumplings and hot&sour soup.  Soup had zero flavor, dumplings tasted freezer burned and processed.  General tso chicken was ehh. \n\nA lot of good reviews on here so it must be for eat in and for their dim sum.  Don't order delivery, you will be left hungry and unsatisfied.","Went there on Saturday for early lunch.  My wife did the dim sum, it was okay, we were both disgusted by the sugar cane shrimp; but the rest was good.  \n\nI ordered the chicken szechwuan, the waitress warned me it was \"spicy\" the reason I ordered it.  It came out delicious, but not what I would call spicy.  Overall its hard to find good Chinese in the valley and I would call this good without hesitation.","So I was referred to this place from the front desk of my hotel. I'm from SF so I'm coming from a place with really good chinese food. \n\nThe dim sum is just \"ok\" nothing for me to write home about. The one dish that I really liked was the chinese broccoli cooked with garlic sauce. Yum yum yum.  It's in a big bowl, not oily, not saucy, just really good. I think it's $7.50.  \n\nIt's a somewhat pricey and just like all chinese restaurants, it's not the cleanest.  The chair was filthy.  the dishes weren't all that great.  I wouldn't go back unless I want the chinese broccoli.  \n\nSo I went on a Sunday and it was not crowded at all. There's not a huge asian population  in Phoenix (not that I could tell) so I don't think there's a high demand for dim sum.  And also, I sooooooo felt like taking a pic of this, but a Mexican lady was pushing one of the dim sum carts. That is unheard of in SF.  This is a mainly mandarin restaurant and the dim sum places I go are usually cantonese.  Not a big deal though since the dishes look the same. \n\nDude, there was a turtle in the fish tank that I saw as I left.  I hope they don't eat that!","A Premier Chinese Atmosphere,\nThe Chinese cultural center and Asian Garden produces an Asain atmosphere that can be recognized from the 202.  \n With Dim Sum served this location earns its respect from the local community.\n\nDim Sum tip,  You have to be smart with the Dim Sum ladies they look nice innocent but they are professional sales people that will sell you more dishes than you need before you know what to do.  \n\nI love the desserts here ask the server to see the dessert tray.","This restaurant has a bit of an identity crisis. It is in the Chinese cultural center, but serves Japanese beer (Kirin on tap!) and the live piano music is American pop. We had to ask for chopsticks.\n\nHaving said that, the service was professional. Our waiter held a hot appetizer for one of our party who was away from the table so that it would not be cold when he returned. We were asked frequently--and not too frequently--if things were ok both by our waiter and the manager/proprietor.\n\nThe food was ok-to-good. Fried shrimp egg rolls were dainty but yummy. Duck was tasty but very chewy. Kung-pao chicken was pleasantly spiced. Plenty of rice. A pitcher of ice water with lemon was left at the table. \n\nAtmosphere was also pleasant. Chairs comfortable, tables spaced well, restrooms large and clean...and there is indeed a large golden Buddha by the entrance.","I took a group of friends here and relatives other times. The place is consistently good for Dim-sum during lunch. It is typical Chinese and nothing fancy.\n\nWhat helps this place is the moat scenery.  3 stars for visiting here based on convenience since there are similar places in town.","Having grown up in Hong Kong and having eaten dim sum in London, NY, LA, SF and Vancouver (actually Richmond), I can confidently say I know my dim sum.\n\nGood selection of well-executed dim sum when the carts actually come around and there's anything left in it.  I'd give it 4 stars for food but the wait definitely detracted from the whole experience.\n\nI think the problem with Golden Buddha is that they can't handle the heavy flow on weekends.  There's not enough regular dim sum eaters like LA that can sustain a steady flow of diners throughout the week, forcing restaurants like Golden Buddha to depend heavily on extra part-time help on weekends.  \n\nDim sum takes serious skill so the chef still ends up doing most of the work.  When we looked into the kitchen, we saw a Chinese woman doing most of the cooking herself.  No wonder it took forever for a cart to come out and when it does, it's swarmed on by a pack of vultures.\n\nIf you're willing to eat at a more simply decorated place with a smaller menu, I'd highly recommend China Chan.  It's much more relaxed - usually no wait on weekends.  An experienced chef makes all the dim sum himself so the menu's much shorter but all the classics are on it.  Anything steamed is made to order so is very fresh.","Situated in the Chinese Cultural Center near the SkyHarbor Airport, this was another pleasant find. All I had was the Dim Sum menu, and I would say this is the best you're gonna get in Phoenix. Still worth the stop to get your Dim Sum fix. The cart ladies were pleasant and very happy to converse with me in Cantonese. Only downside was the chicken sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaves, naw mei gai, was way overcooked, and mushy.","Do you want to eat Chinese Food in an elegant environment on a Friday night in Phoenix? \n\nBe entertained by classic, quiet standards being played live on a piano while you dine?\n\nAre you 50 years old and Caucasian?\n\nThen the Golden Buddha is the place for you! \n\nIts in the Chinese Cultural Center Mall on 44th, and a popular weekend spot for Dim Sum. For a DIm Sum starved Valley of the Sun, Golden Buddha's is decent. \n\nFor dinner, though, it is awfully Americanized and not very authentic Chinese. But with a bunch of American customers coming for dinner, what do you expect? They probably think they are getting \"real Chinese\" food by going to the Chinese Mall, but then again, they are used to PF Chang's or Stix normally in their neighborhood, so this is a step up.\n\nThe best thing about this place is the decor, which is clean and nice, with a Hong Kong Junk boat design covering the ceiling from the bar into the dining room. The next best thing is the Piano interludes on weekend nights. The service is next, which is a little overly eager to remove your plate, and the last thing is the food. \n\nThey do give decent portions. I ordered Guo Teh (potstickers) and got 6 fat ones. But they weren't served with the usual soy, chili oil and vinegar, but a soy and green onions mixture. The Mapo Tofu was ok, as they used a nice silky tofu, which was nice, but no green onions, and sliced black mushrooms instead, which I like, but not in this dish.\n\nCome here for the ambiance and music in the evenings, or on the weekend days for Dim Sum.","Decent dim sum, especially to be found in the middle of the desert. Sadly, the best food I've had in Phoenix.","This place is a little difficult for me to review.  I was staying at the Hampton Inn across the street and this is the closest restaurant so off I went.\n\nI walked in and the owner or manager met me at the door and asked \"how many\"?\n\nI told him I wanted to order take out and handed me a menu and pointed to the waiting area which was covered in newspapers.  I chose to go to the bar, order a glass of wine, and peruse the menu.\n\nThe drinks are expensive but I didn't think the food was.  Less than $10 for my Mongolian Chicken which came with white sticky rice and a fortune cookie.  When ordering I asked if I could have fried rice instead of white rice but was told \"no\".  Most places allow this for a nominal fee.\n\nFine by me.  Give the white rice.  Food was prepared and their to-go boxes were a lot better than the standard white Chinese \"to go\" boxes.  They also included the plastic-ware, napkin, and soy sauce, which a lot of places forget.\n\nLooking around I found a whole lot of goodness along with a couple disappointments.  Most notably the newspaper strewn about and behind the bar, to the right were a lot of boxes stacked in an unsightly fashion.  I could have been a little more presentable in my opinion.\n\nI peeked into the dining room because I wanted to see if the piano music was piped in or live.  It was live which was very nice. Also, the dinning room looked very nice and cozy.\n\nAs I was leaving the same man who greeted me upon entering made sure to wish me a good evening.  My initial impression of the man was that he was surly and testy but that's just how he comes off.\n\nThe food was very good.  The Mongolian sauce was mixture of sweet with spice and the chicken and vegetables all tasted fresh.","My husband and I went there Saturday, the service was great!  Our friends were going to be late so they told us to start.  And start we did!\nThey were serving Dim Sum, something we had never tried, so glad we did, it was wonderful, hubby wouldn't do the chicken feet, but I think next time I will, it looked very good.\nOur friends showed up and ordered their food, and ate all of it, they said that usually they take food home, but it was so good they had to eat all of it!\nWe will be going back very soon!","Let's see, over 50... check \nold white man...........check \neats dinner ...............check \nlistens to the piano  check \n\nwow this must be the place for me, I mean after all it is in a Chinese mall, no make that a Chinese Cultural Center. How could I possibly have discerning taste with such trickery to get me here to eat. \nDude if you are going to rate a restaurant no need to degrade others with your arrogance. \nFool is my review of wanugee N. \n\nNow on the restaurant. The last time we were here the food was not good, the piano was too loud and the waitress had a real attitude. IT won't keep me from going back as I have had good meals and wait service too. \n\nBack to wanugee N. I do not expect any place in Phx. to have authentic Chinese food, by that I mean the street food one finds in China. \nBut I do expect what I fork in to my mouth is worth what I am going to fork over in cost. Even an old white guy like me can tell the difference between good and bad food. No matter what it is called.","Okay so Ive been glum the past few days as I have an impending birthday. Every year this time I get all down in the dumps.. not that I'm not happy with my life cause life is good. Its more like getting further away from my youth and closer to being well, old. All of my grandparents were crotchety, sourpuss drama queens.. is that my fate? Can I break the mold or am I to going to be a crotchety sourpuss?\n\nSo as I contemplate and figure out what I'm going to do with my birthday baggage I decide to squash it with food. All weekend Ive been eating out and having a good time. This is one of the few times outside of a vacation where I will live it completely and to the near of sheer gluttony. So why not dim sum? \n\nIve chowed much dim sum in my 36 years of earthen wear.. of course some good and some bad. I have never been to a place where every dish was great.. Golden Buddha is no exception to this.. they do the basics well enough and have enough funky cool Asian style to keep me interested in returning. The carts around 1130 flow well but around noon it' s full blown freeway action! In fact there might be some road kill in there based on some of the looks on that last steam cart.. \n\nMe and 3 others who were feeling my pain ordered 14, count them, 14 different dishes. One of my friends is from Georgia and had never had dim sum but he is so courageous and unflinching that he was just a blast. Just the shot in the arm to get me out of my funk. I remember the first time I had dim sum.. my eyes wide open, nostrils flared and excited to see what was under the next steamer lid. That was him today.. one exciting thing after the next.. he was even willing to try chicken feet but this is one of those dishes not done very well here. \n\nMy friend took me back to a time where I was younger and less experienced. He looked up to me to guide him through the noodles, bao and sui mai.. like a big brother.. I'm privileged that I could show him something new and exciting and he was so into it! So instead of feeling sorry for myself I felt experienced and useful.. that there is something I can give back to others.. that its not all about me and me aging but about what can be shared with others.\n\nThere is so much more to do, give and feel in this short time we are here.. and Ill do it to, one bite at a time.","The best to be found in land locked Arizona.  My favorite sticky rice is here.  They have dim sum every day, but not a huge selection, though you can order off the menu.  I think it is much bigger on the weekends.  I'm just happy I can get my fix 7 days a week.  Beautiful gardens to walk through, with fish ponds, and a 99 market next door!","I ate at Golden Buddha a few weeks ago.  We ate at the restaurant after a day at the zoo with our 4 year old and had a blast.  The piano bar played tunes for my daughter and the staff was more than accommodating.  The general tso chicken was better than anything I can get in Tucson.  The soup was chocked full of fresh, read FRESH, not canned, vegetables.  All in all, I was very satisfied with the meal and the service.  Plus the decor is very nice, clean and cheery. \n\nEat at Golden Buddha.","For those who gave this place low marks, forgive me. I really like this place. Now I haven't tried various dim sum places so I'm reserving the right to downgrade the place as needed. The variety of food is plentiful, and the carts just keep on coming. I love the steamed pork buns, and the shiu mai (not sure if I spelled that correctly). Yesterday, my favorite pick was the deep fried rolls of taro and shrimp. YUM! I have never ordered from their menu so I can only talk about their dim sum. My friends and I try to go eat dim sum almost every Sunday. It's a cheap way to try new foods, and if you don't like it, well.. you can get away with pushing it aside with minimal guilt. Give it a try! You might be surprised.","I like Golden Buddha, have taken many friends there for Dim Sum.  \nTry not to \"hit\" the dumpling cart to heavy; otherwise cannot finish it to the dessert cart (LOL).\nLove the jasmine tea and the staff willing to help you if you do not understand the what each item is.\nSingapore Rice Noodles a favorite, along with any of the shrimp dumplings; also the broccoli and green beans.\nOnly wish that the carts with eggplant stuffed with shrimp or green peppers with shrimp were not on \"heated\" carts; by the time it gets to you the food is cold.\nOnly concern is that went on 22MAY2010 at 1:30PM; there was a closed sign due to electricity???\nREVISED: 26MAY2010 - called this evening - looks like they are back open again.","I've been to the Golden Buddha on several occasions and it is my favorite, by far, for honest Chinese food. \nWhile I've sampled everything from their vegetarian to their beef, I love their mandarin chicken. More recently, I was delighted to relive the wonders of their Kung Pao Chicken and Beef with Broccoli. \nI absolutely love the egg drop soup and mini crab rangoons that come with the meal.","The very first time I went to Golden Buddha was with my BFF and it was our first dim sum experience. Little did I know this would forever change my life and eating experiences. Although I must admit that first time was a bit awkward.\n\nGB wisely takes reservations which was wonderful (even though it wasn't crazy busy). Our assorted dim sum plates were flavorful and fresh. And the carts seemed to be in constant rotation so we were never too far from a good selection.\n\nWhat really helps GB is its location. The Cofco Center is an experience in itself, where one can have herbs specially blended, select a fresh member of marine life to take home and cook or browse through a store with one of the largest selections of Buddhas and hand fans I've experienced outside of San Francisco.","I've been to Golden Buddha a few times and have not been disappointed. \n\nThey have a LARGE selection of Dim Sum and if you're not careful you can get carried away.\n\nTry and get there early and you'll get the best and most fresh selection.\nMake sure you walk around the garden when you're done.","Probably the most comprehensive Chinese menu in the Valley.  Pick from well over 100 dishes, but if you want the best order the Peking Duck.  Everything else is very good, but without a wow factor.  You'll see lots of Chinese people in this massive restaurant, which probably means they're doing a fine job in the kitchen.","I very much enjoyed eating here. Food was great. Fairly fast service. Wasn't expensive either for the 4 of us.","Golden Buddha has GREAT dim sum.  Their prices are reasonable and the staff is very polite wheeling their little carts.  I tend to go on the weekend because there is more selection but they do dim sum throughout the week.  They also have some very authentic dishes on the menu for those who are more of the adventurous types.  Be sure to say hello to the turtles the next time you go.","This place in the Chinese Cultural Center has a very pretty and elegant bar area. I was pleased to learn that they had some very reasonable and delicious happy hour snacks. This is a good place for a Pina Colada. I had one by myself along with some dumplings and fried shrimp appetizer. Sadly I never brought anyone else here with me. It was happy hour heaven but you know? A lot of my friends in AZ pretty much hang out in one neighborhood or another and nobody I know really lives close to the Buddha.\nThe airport is pretty close by. This might be a good pre-flight send-off location.","I have had dim sum in New Orleans and Phoenix (not SF), and this is about equal to the best of New Orleans as far as flavor.\nAs for ambiance, today was a good day. I've had dim sum here about a dozen times, and have had very good service and quality 90% of the time, including weekends. I have had bad days here, but since today was good, I'll rate accordingly. It's closer to a 4.5, but since I can't give half-stars, I rounded up.\nDon't expect me to give these the right names, but... I was less than impressed with the bbq pork balls. They tasted too much like honey and the beef was minimal. The bbq sauce tasted bottled. Outside of that, their herbal hot tea is delicious even on a hot day.\nThe shu mai were very good, and the shrimp in a spinach dumpling was fantastic. A definite don't miss is their sticky rice in lotus leaf. It's among the best I've had anywhere. Just be careful; you'll find bones in it every once in a while. Go for any of their steamed dumplings; they're very flavorful. As others have said, I love the Chinese broccoli, but you'll only find it on the carts on weekends. Otherwise order it off the menu.\nToday (11:30 lunch) the carts came around often, and everything except the pork buns was piping hot and fresh. By the way, despite the price increases, even the sticky rice was considered a medium size entree, and the two of us eating there escaped with a bill under $20 and we were done in under 30 minutes.\nI strongly recommend the dim sum here, whether you've had it a million times or have never had it before. You usually won't be disappointed.","I don't really understand the poor reviews on this place.....maybe it depends on the day you go? We went on a Sunday, it was crazy busy, but service was great! (of course, my view of customer service is a little different then the rest... I used to live on an island where you were just happy to find what you were looking for, let alone expect good customer service) Anyways, our server was very sweet! Always had a smile on her face. The carts served us promplty and none of the food was cold. They always had whatever we wanted (I hate having to wait for the next cart).\n\nNow, as for the actual dim sum and food.......holy cow, to die for! So flavorful and fresh!! The broccoli makes you sing...and the wine noodles, make you cry. You leave with very weird mixed emotions, but mostly a happy belly full of yummy food.\n\nIn my opinion, this is the best dim sum I have been able to find in Phx. I'm ditching my previous spot (Mekong Palace) and will be back to Golden Buddha when the dim sum monster strikes again!"],"type":["Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low

waiter was to be found about ten minutes later they gave us our water and left again! It wasn't even busy! There were only TWO dim sum carts floating around somewhere. Then our waiter finally came around and took our orders of lunch entrees. The food was not even that good as the reviews that are posted on here. When we came up to pay, the bill was super overpriced. I will not be returning here, I am better off eating at Great Wall Cuisine.","If this place had zero stars I would have given them that ! Let me start off by saying I was so excited to read all great reviews so maybe I just came in on a off day? We walked in and were seated came over and asked if we wanted water or tea I guess they don't serve anything Else, Then we placed an order pork dumplings and sticky rice nasty! Then I asked if they served egg rolls they said they were out!!! they pushed their little carts around with hot plates that basically steam the food and is not fresh and what you get is soggy poor customer service we had to get up and look for someone to give us our tab so we could get the heck out of there are get some real food. It looked like it would be a great place for groups of people would not recommend if you are on mission for what you want and want to place an order but it could be a fun experience for some people.","You walk into a Chinese restaurant on a Saturday afternoon for dim sum and you expect the place to be PACKED.  Well, walking in to a pretty much empty dining room, it's a VERY CLEAR SIGN.  But my friend insisted and I was very hesitant for good reasons.  Another indicator, the majority of the patrons were NON Asian.  \n\nFood: You walk in and you see carts of the food by the entrance to the dining room.  Umm, I thought dim sum should come right off the steamer and into the carts and they roll it around, not sitting around.  The dim sum was garbage.  It had the typical selection, but at minimum.  \n\nService: It's ok.  But it doesn't make up for the horrible food.\n\nBottom line: NO WAY!  Stay away!","I've been here many times...Mother's Day with family, dim sum with book club, etc. But I will not go back again.  I stopped in to ask the owner about a donation or reduced price for a class of under-privileged kids that I volunteer with.  His reaction was to scoff and shoo me out the door while handing me his card and saying I could email him.  He turned his back and headed off to the messy newspaper-strewn table he haunts between guests arrivals.  Maybe he's a community-minded business owner, but then again, maybe he's not.  I'll be dining elsewhere.","Being from Chicago, we are used to getting authentic Chinese food all the time.  But when we first starting spending a lot of time in Scottsdale/Phoenix, we found it a challenge to get authentic Chinese food.  We were excited to find the Golden Buddha and have made many trips over the years all the way from the Troon North area to get our fix.  However, service has declined to the point where it is no longer worth the aggravation.  We went there last night for Chinese New Year and will never go back.  Granted they were very busy because of a lot of large tables there, but waiting almost an hour to get our food is not acceptable under any circumstance!  45 mins. into our wait, the waitress came back (after we flagged her down to ask about our food) and said one of the dishes we ordered was not available....after 45 mins.!!!! What makes the whole experience an unforgivable one is that the manager/owner is so indifferent and never apologized or offered a discount off the bill...nothing.  When we left, the same manager was at the piano singing in Chinese. Huh?  Other than Nee House in Scottsdale, the search goes on for a restaurant that serves authentic Chinese food closer to home.","I will NEVER go there again.  I reserved a table for a group of 16 people for 5:00 PM on Christmas Eve .  The person on the phone ( I believe the manager) repeatedly asked me to call ahead and give him an accurate head count since he said they'd be swamped that day.  I followed up with him twice.  \nWhen the first couple of us arrived, we had menus shoved in our faces immediately and told we \"Must order now.  Must order now\" because they were going to be busy later on.  The place was practically empty.  As each person arrived, they were treated the same way. \nWe rushed and placed our orders and then they brought out our checks WAY before we saw any sign of our food.  I have never in my life been treated so rudely by a restaurant.\nIt was utter chaos when the food started coming out while everyone struggled to get the correct dish they ordered.  One person didn't get her food until we were all just about finished eating. \nOne top of all that, the food wasn't even good.  I've had better Kung Pao Chicken at Panda Express!\nAfter being rushed through our meal, the place wasn't even half full by the time we left.  I thought being at the Cultural Center, this restaurant would be a sure thing but boy was I wrong.  Lovely way to spend Christmas Eve..","If you are looking a chinese restaurant to host a big party look some other than the Golden Buddah.  I recently attended a banquet at the Golden Buddah and I was shocked at the level of quality of food and service.  Of the 10 dishes served 4 were nearly inedible.  \n\nThere was a crab claw appetizer, most chinese restaurants prepare this dish by taking a crab claw surrounding it with ground shrimp, batter and then deep fry.  At Golden Buddah, the crab claw served was mostly batter.  \n\nThe shark fin soup served was mostly broth.  Shark fin is an expensive ingredient and most places usually use imitation shark fin, but come on at least put something in there so that I know I'm eating soup and not dirty sink water.  \n\nGinger scallion lobster is battered, fried, and then stir fried in a sauce with ginger and scallions.  The ginger scallion lobster served was over-cooked and dried out.  \n\nLastly, there was a steamed fish.  The fish was raw in the middle.   \n\nIt wasn't all bad, there was a crispy chicken with garlic dish that was pretty good, but out of 10 dishes 4 were bad, 5 were okay, and 1 was good.  \n\nDoes 4 bad dishes out of 10 warrant a one star rating?  Well it does when you factor in the service.  The soup, appetizer, and first entree arrived timely, but after that there was a 1 hour gap before we received the next dish.  The dishes were not served with accompanying white rice which I thought was odd.  We had to ask for it, and even the rice took a while to arrive.","I agree with Crystal C., that the dim sum isn't the greatest I've ever had. In fact, I am not sure if the meal was so tasty that it was memorable. I do remember the \"calamari\" was not really calamari, like you would think. It was presented more like a sweet and sour pork (so calamari with LOTS of breading) without any sauce. As a result, the dish was dry and salty.\n\nThe sticky rice was good (hard to mess up), the chicken feet were okay (needed more five spice powder), and the shumai was alright. The noodles were good, and I can see why the cart ran out after the first round. The diners were an equal mix of Asians and Americans. I would've preferred to see more Asians eating (as I am used to in a Chinatown and gives an indication of authenticity), but I do realize we're in Phoenix where the Asian population is not like San Francisco or Houston. \n\nThe meal came to about $30 for two, including jasmine tea. The carts are loud because they are made out of metal and roll on tile. I am also not used to staff members shouting what they have in their cart, like a newspaper boy yelling \"Extra! Extra!\" Christmas music was playing after mid-January, so the atmosphere felt strange. Next time I visit the city, I probably will pass.","Can't say that I was very impressed. Came for dinner in a hopeful and enthusiastic mood since the reviews have been pretty good, but I don't think this place lives up to its current good, but declining rating.\n\nOrdered the Combo fried rice (shrimp, chicken, beef, pork), sesame chicken, and garlic fried chicken. \n\nThe combo fried rice was pretty good, but ended up drinking about 6 glasses of water due to the MSG and sodium content. You'd think that the cook spent his better years in the French Foreign Legion in the Sahara eating salt tablets and developed a taste for them. \n\nThe sesame chicken had a good flavor and a thick brown sweet sauce. I liked it a lot until it got cool and the sauce looked (with that stringy consistency) more like glue. You think I'm kidding? I'm not.\n\nGarlic fried chicken was bad. Just bad. It was like an over roasted dried out half chicken with some dried garlic pieces sprinkled on top. No spices, no flavor, no good. \n\nWe then got all kinds of lip from the waitress when we asked if they could change the channel on the TV from college football, to the Suns game. They made it into this big deal that the \"customers\" wanted to see the football game. Yeah right, it was University of West Virginia Vs. University of Connecticut! I would have believed it if it was a local team....\n\nIt's better than a 1 star joint, but only because it's borderline edible. To be avoided.","This restaurant is located in the Chinese Cultural Center and was the one restaurant that I had not been to. So after some shopping at one of the shops, we stepped in to have dinner.\n\nWe stepped in and asked for a seat for two. We were seated immediately. The place was decorated nicely and a lady playing the piano made for great ambiance.\n\nWe looked at the menu briefly and ordered our drinks, an appetizer, a soup and two main dishes. The drinks came out promptly and so did the rest of the meal. My goodness everything we ordered was very tasty.\n\nThe waiter service itself however was not even close to the decor and food. He never introduced himself, and although he took our order, our food itself was brought out by a kitchen person.\n\nAfter we ordered our waiter really never came back asking if we needed anything else, except to give us our check at the end and that was after the person I was dining with got up and asked a different waiter for it.\n\nIt's amazing how a place with great food, decor, and ambiance can mess it all up by crappy waiter service.","I love Dim Sum, my favorite Chinese dish.\n\nWhen Golden Buddha first open, they have excellent Dim sum. I went there many times, I tell my friend how good it is, But now,  they change cook, taste more like  week old left over. Rumor has it, they change cook every few month, so Quality of cooking change. (not sure if that is true, but that is what I was told.)\nMy advice is; when you walk in the door and the place is pack, = Good Cook. if the place is bare = bad cook. leave immediately. don't waste your money.","If you just \"want\" dim sum, go here. If you are \"craving\" dim sum, go elsewhere (take a 5 hour drive west to neighboring state, California).\n\nAnyway, I've been visiting Golden Buddha in the noontime for roughly 2 years now. I believe they moved from their original site (7th St. & Osborn), formerly \"China Doll.\" Relocation brought along better atmosphere and smiling faces. This does not mean, better dim sum. But since we are in Phoenix, I will settle for what they have to offer. \n\nBe mindful of the dim sum tab. It's itemized high-medium-low. \n\nShaomai can be found as combinations of pork/mushroom, shrimp, or shark fin (which should not be confused as true shark bits, as the shaomai is prepared to look like a shark's fin). These picks are okay...perhaps on a better day shao mai will be served in less-rigid, or fresher wrappers. Potstickers are okay as well, just the usual scallion and pork, and dry wrapper. The baby pork ribs in light black bean sauce and jalapenos is alright, but sometimes lacks in taste. Tripe is also served in its bare minimum...so if you enjoy the texture and flavor of tripe, try this with its clear sauce and thinly sliced carrots and celery.  \nBuche (that's what I call it), or fried sesame balls are also available, although if you wait until dessert, they will also be a bit stiff. There are a few other things that may be \"spotted\" but are not worth mentioning. \n\nDon't order from their lunch menu, as you can find these over-salted dishes at Panda Express anyway. \n\nOverall, dim sum at Golden Buddha is a place to go if you are around the vicinity and feel like having something apart from the usual fast food. However, discriminating palates- beware.","Not impressed with this place at all. This was not the friendliest place around, maybe because of the language barrier (most or all were clearly native Chinese speakers), or maybe just the attitude of the employees.\n\nI ordered the sweet and sour chicken lunch, which came with the typical egg drop soup, crab rangoon, and egg roll. The soup was ok - maybe it's just me, but I prefer a real spoon to the scoop that they gave me. The egg roll was tiny and not that great, and the crab rangoon was ok, but maybe a little undercooked. The chicken wasn't bad, but nothing special, as was the rice and other stuff on the plate.\n\nOverall, this was just not my kind of Chinese place.","Disappointing.  Mediocre at best.  I am staying at the Aloft hotel in phoenix and ordered some delivery. I ordered a couple american chinese food staples: general tso's chicken, dumplings and hot&sour soup.  Soup had zero flavor, dumplings tasted freezer burned and processed.  General tso chicken was ehh. \n\nA lot of good reviews on here so it must be for eat in and for their dim sum.  Don't order delivery, you will be left hungry and unsatisfied.","Went there on Saturday for early lunch.  My wife did the dim sum, it was okay, we were both disgusted by the sugar cane shrimp; but the rest was good.  \n\nI ordered the chicken szechwuan, the waitress warned me it was \"spicy\" the reason I ordered it.  It came out delicious, but not what I would call spicy.  Overall its hard to find good Chinese in the valley and I would call this good without hesitation.","So I was referred to this place from the front desk of my hotel. I'm from SF so I'm coming from a place with really good chinese food. \n\nThe dim sum is just \"ok\" nothing for me to write home about. The one dish that I really liked was the chinese broccoli cooked with garlic sauce. Yum yum yum.  It's in a big bowl, not oily, not saucy, just really good. I think it's $7.50.  \n\nIt's a somewhat pricey and just like all chinese restaurants, it's not the cleanest.  The chair was filthy.  the dishes weren't all that great.  I wouldn't go back unless I want the chinese broccoli.  \n\nSo I went on a Sunday and it was not crowded at all. There's not a huge asian population  in Phoenix (not that I could tell) so I don't think there's a high demand for dim sum.  And also, I sooooooo felt like taking a pic of this, but a Mexican lady was pushing one of the dim sum carts. That is unheard of in SF.  This is a mainly mandarin restaurant and the dim sum places I go are usually cantonese.  Not a big deal though since the dishes look the same. \n\nDude, there was a turtle in the fish tank that I saw as I left.  I hope they don't eat that!","A Premier Chinese Atmosphere,\nThe Chinese cultural center and Asian Garden produces an Asain atmosphere that can be recognized from the 202.  \n With Dim Sum served this location earns its respect from the local community.\n\nDim Sum tip,  You have to be smart with the Dim Sum ladies they look nice innocent but they are professional sales people that will sell you more dishes than you need before you know what to do.  \n\nI love the desserts here ask the server to see the dessert tray.","This restaurant has a bit of an identity crisis. It is in the Chinese cultural center, but serves Japanese beer (Kirin on tap!) and the live piano music is American pop. We had to ask for chopsticks.\n\nHaving said that, the service was professional. Our waiter held a hot appetizer for one of our party who was away from the table so that it would not be cold when he returned. We were asked frequently--and not too frequently--if things were ok both by our waiter and the manager/proprietor.\n\nThe food was ok-to-good. Fried shrimp egg rolls were dainty but yummy. Duck was tasty but very chewy. Kung-pao chicken was pleasantly spiced. Plenty of rice. A pitcher of ice water with lemon was left at the table. \n\nAtmosphere was also pleasant. Chairs comfortable, tables spaced well, restrooms large and clean...and there is indeed a large golden Buddha by the entrance.","I took a group of friends here and relatives other times. The place is consistently good for Dim-sum during lunch. It is typical Chinese and nothing fancy.\n\nWhat helps this place is the moat scenery.  3 stars for visiting here based on convenience since there are similar places in town.","Having grown up in Hong Kong and having eaten dim sum in London, NY, LA, SF and Vancouver (actually Richmond), I can confidently say I know my dim sum.\n\nGood selection of well-executed dim sum when the carts actually come around and there's anything left in it.  I'd give it 4 stars for food but the wait definitely detracted from the whole experience.\n\nI think the problem with Golden Buddha is that they can't handle the heavy flow on weekends.  There's not enough regular dim sum eaters like LA that can sustain a steady flow of diners throughout the week, forcing restaurants like Golden Buddha to depend heavily on extra part-time help on weekends.  \n\nDim sum takes serious skill so the chef still ends up doing most of the work.  When we looked into the kitchen, we saw a Chinese woman doing most of the cooking herself.  No wonder it took forever for a cart to come out and when it does, it's swarmed on by a pack of vultures.\n\nIf you're willing to eat at a more simply decorated place with a smaller menu, I'd highly recommend China Chan.  It's much more relaxed - usually no wait on weekends.  An experienced chef makes all the dim sum himself so the menu's much shorter but all the classics are on it.  Anything steamed is made to order so is very fresh.","Situated in the Chinese Cultural Center near the SkyHarbor Airport, this was another pleasant find. All I had was the Dim Sum menu, and I would say this is the best you're gonna get in Phoenix. Still worth the stop to get your Dim Sum fix. The cart ladies were pleasant and very happy to converse with me in Cantonese. Only downside was the chicken sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaves, naw mei gai, was way overcooked, and mushy.","Do you want to eat Chinese Food in an elegant environment on a Friday night in Phoenix? \n\nBe entertained by classic, quiet standards being played live on a piano while you dine?\n\nAre you 50 years old and Caucasian?\n\nThen the Golden Buddha is the place for you! \n\nIts in the Chinese Cultural Center Mall on 44th, and a popular weekend spot for Dim Sum. For a DIm Sum starved Valley of the Sun, Golden Buddha's is decent. \n\nFor dinner, though, it is awfully Americanized and not very authentic Chinese. But with a bunch of American customers coming for dinner, what do you expect? They probably think they are getting \"real Chinese\" food by going to the Chinese Mall, but then again, they are used to PF Chang's or Stix normally in their neighborhood, so this is a step up.\n\nThe best thing about this place is the decor, which is clean and nice, with a Hong Kong Junk boat design covering the ceiling from the bar into the dining room. The next best thing is the Piano interludes on weekend nights. The service is next, which is a little overly eager to remove your plate, and the last thing is the food. \n\nThey do give decent portions. I ordered Guo Teh (potstickers) and got 6 fat ones. But they weren't served with the usual soy, chili oil and vinegar, but a soy and green onions mixture. The Mapo Tofu was ok, as they used a nice silky tofu, which was nice, but no green onions, and sliced black mushrooms instead, which I like, but not in this dish.\n\nCome here for the ambiance and music in the evenings, or on the weekend days for Dim Sum.","Decent dim sum, especially to be found in the middle of the desert. Sadly, the best food I've had in Phoenix.","This place is a little difficult for me to review.  I was staying at the Hampton Inn across the street and this is the closest restaurant so off I went.\n\nI walked in and the owner or manager met me at the door and asked \"how many\"?\n\nI told him I wanted to order take out and handed me a menu and pointed to the waiting area which was covered in newspapers.  I chose to go to the bar, order a glass of wine, and peruse the menu.\n\nThe drinks are expensive but I didn't think the food was.  Less than $10 for my Mongolian Chicken which came with white sticky rice and a fortune cookie.  When ordering I asked if I could have fried rice instead of white rice but was told \"no\".  Most places allow this for a nominal fee.\n\nFine by me.  Give the white rice.  Food was prepared and their to-go boxes were a lot better than the standard white Chinese \"to go\" boxes.  They also included the plastic-ware, napkin, and soy sauce, which a lot of places forget.\n\nLooking around I found a whole lot of goodness along with a couple disappointments.  Most notably the newspaper strewn about and behind the bar, to the right were a lot of boxes stacked in an unsightly fashion.  I could have been a little more presentable in my opinion.\n\nI peeked into the dining room because I wanted to see if the piano music was piped in or live.  It was live which was very nice. Also, the dinning room looked very nice and cozy.\n\nAs I was leaving the same man who greeted me upon entering made sure to wish me a good evening.  My initial impression of the man was that he was surly and testy but that's just how he comes off.\n\nThe food was very good.  The Mongolian sauce was mixture of sweet with spice and the chicken and vegetables all tasted fresh.","My husband and I went there Saturday, the service was great!  Our friends were going to be late so they told us to start.  And start we did!\nThey were serving Dim Sum, something we had never tried, so glad we did, it was wonderful, hubby wouldn't do the chicken feet, but I think next time I will, it looked very good.\nOur friends showed up and ordered their food, and ate all of it, they said that usually they take food home, but it was so good they had to eat all of it!\nWe will be going back very soon!","Let's see, over 50... check \nold white man...........check \neats dinner ...............check \nlistens to the piano  check \n\nwow this must be the place for me, I mean after all it is in a Chinese mall, no make that a Chinese Cultural Center. How could I possibly have discerning taste with such trickery to get me here to eat. \nDude if you are going to rate a restaurant no need to degrade others with your arrogance. \nFool is my review of wanugee N. \n\nNow on the restaurant. The last time we were here the food was not good, the piano was too loud and the waitress had a real attitude. IT won't keep me from going back as I have had good meals and wait service too. \n\nBack to wanugee N. I do not expect any place in Phx. to have authentic Chinese food, by that I mean the street food one finds in China. \nBut I do expect what I fork in to my mouth is worth what I am going to fork over in cost. Even an old white guy like me can tell the difference between good and bad food. No matter what it is called.","Okay so Ive been glum the past few days as I have an impending birthday. Every year this time I get all down in the dumps.. not that I'm not happy with my life cause life is good. Its more like getting further away from my youth and closer to being well, old. All of my grandparents were crotchety, sourpuss drama queens.. is that my fate? Can I break the mold or am I to going to be a crotchety sourpuss?\n\nSo as I contemplate and figure out what I'm going to do with my birthday baggage I decide to squash it with food. All weekend Ive been eating out and having a good time. This is one of the few times outside of a vacation where I will live it completely and to the near of sheer gluttony. So why not dim sum? \n\nIve chowed much dim sum in my 36 years of earthen wear.. of course some good and some bad. I have never been to a place where every dish was great.. Golden Buddha is no exception to this.. they do the basics well enough and have enough funky cool Asian style to keep me interested in returning. The carts around 1130 flow well but around noon it' s full blown freeway action! In fact there might be some road kill in there based on some of the looks on that last steam cart.. \n\nMe and 3 others who were feeling my pain ordered 14, count them, 14 different dishes. One of my friends is from Georgia and had never had dim sum but he is so courageous and unflinching that he was just a blast. Just the shot in the arm to get me out of my funk. I remember the first time I had dim sum.. my eyes wide open, nostrils flared and excited to see what was under the next steamer lid. That was him today.. one exciting thing after the next.. he was even willing to try chicken feet but this is one of those dishes not done very well here. \n\nMy friend took me back to a time where I was younger and less experienced. He looked up to me to guide him through the noodles, bao and sui mai.. like a big brother.. I'm privileged that I could show him something new and exciting and he was so into it! So instead of feeling sorry for myself I felt experienced and useful.. that there is something I can give back to others.. that its not all about me and me aging but about what can be shared with others.\n\nThere is so much more to do, give and feel in this short time we are here.. and Ill do it to, one bite at a time.","The best to be found in land locked Arizona.  My favorite sticky rice is here.  They have dim sum every day, but not a huge selection, though you can order off the menu.  I think it is much bigger on the weekends.  I'm just happy I can get my fix 7 days a week.  Beautiful gardens to walk through, with fish ponds, and a 99 market next door!","I ate at Golden Buddha a few weeks ago.  We ate at the restaurant after a day at the zoo with our 4 year old and had a blast.  The piano bar played tunes for my daughter and the staff was more than accommodating.  The general tso chicken was better than anything I can get in Tucson.  The soup was chocked full of fresh, read FRESH, not canned, vegetables.  All in all, I was very satisfied with the meal and the service.  Plus the decor is very nice, clean and cheery. \n\nEat at Golden Buddha.","For those who gave this place low marks, forgive me. I really like this place. Now I haven't tried various dim sum places so I'm reserving the right to downgrade the place as needed. The variety of food is plentiful, and the carts just keep on coming. I love the steamed pork buns, and the shiu mai (not sure if I spelled that correctly). Yesterday, my favorite pick was the deep fried rolls of taro and shrimp. YUM! I have never ordered from their menu so I can only talk about their dim sum. My friends and I try to go eat dim sum almost every Sunday. It's a cheap way to try new foods, and if you don't like it, well.. you can get away with pushing it aside with minimal guilt. Give it a try! You might be surprised.","I like Golden Buddha, have taken many friends there for Dim Sum.  \nTry not to \"hit\" the dumpling cart to heavy; otherwise cannot finish it to the dessert cart (LOL).\nLove the jasmine tea and the staff willing to help you if you do not understand the what each item is.\nSingapore Rice Noodles a favorite, along with any of the shrimp dumplings; also the broccoli and green beans.\nOnly wish that the carts with eggplant stuffed with shrimp or green peppers with shrimp were not on \"heated\" carts; by the time it gets to you the food is cold.\nOnly concern is that went on 22MAY2010 at 1:30PM; there was a closed sign due to electricity???\nREVISED: 26MAY2010 - called this evening - looks like they are back open again.","I've been to the Golden Buddha on several occasions and it is my favorite, by far, for honest Chinese food. \nWhile I've sampled everything from their vegetarian to their beef, I love their mandarin chicken. More recently, I was delighted to relive the wonders of their Kung Pao Chicken and Beef with Broccoli. \nI absolutely love the egg drop soup and mini crab rangoons that come with the meal.","The very first time I went to Golden Buddha was with my BFF and it was our first dim sum experience. Little did I know this would forever change my life and eating experiences. Although I must admit that first time was a bit awkward.\n\nGB wisely takes reservations which was wonderful (even though it wasn't crazy busy). Our assorted dim sum plates were flavorful and fresh. And the carts seemed to be in constant rotation so we were never too far from a good selection.\n\nWhat really helps GB is its location. The Cofco Center is an experience in itself, where one can have herbs specially blended, select a fresh member of marine life to take home and cook or browse through a store with one of the largest selections of Buddhas and hand fans I've experienced outside of San Francisco.","I've been to Golden Buddha a few times and have not been disappointed. \n\nThey have a LARGE selection of Dim Sum and if you're not careful you can get carried away.\n\nTry and get there early and you'll get the best and most fresh selection.\nMake sure you walk around the garden when you're done.","Probably the most comprehensive Chinese menu in the Valley.  Pick from well over 100 dishes, but if you want the best order the Peking Duck.  Everything else is very good, but without a wow factor.  You'll see lots of Chinese people in this massive restaurant, which probably means they're doing a fine job in the kitchen.","I very much enjoyed eating here. Food was great. Fairly fast service. Wasn't expensive either for the 4 of us.","Golden Buddha has GREAT dim sum.  Their prices are reasonable and the staff is very polite wheeling their little carts.  I tend to go on the weekend because there is more selection but they do dim sum throughout the week.  They also have some very authentic dishes on the menu for those who are more of the adventurous types.  Be sure to say hello to the turtles the next time you go.","This place in the Chinese Cultural Center has a very pretty and elegant bar area. I was pleased to learn that they had some very reasonable and delicious happy hour snacks. This is a good place for a Pina Colada. I had one by myself along with some dumplings and fried shrimp appetizer. Sadly I never brought anyone else here with me. It was happy hour heaven but you know? A lot of my friends in AZ pretty much hang out in one neighborhood or another and nobody I know really lives close to the Buddha.\nThe airport is pretty close by. This might be a good pre-flight send-off location.","I have had dim sum in New Orleans and Phoenix (not SF), and this is about equal to the best of New Orleans as far as flavor.\nAs for ambiance, today was a good day. I've had dim sum here about a dozen times, and have had very good service and quality 90% of the time, including weekends. I have had bad days here, but since today was good, I'll rate accordingly. It's closer to a 4.5, but since I can't give half-stars, I rounded up.\nDon't expect me to give these the right names, but... I was less than impressed with the bbq pork balls. They tasted too much like honey and the beef was minimal. The bbq sauce tasted bottled. Outside of that, their herbal hot tea is delicious even on a hot day.\nThe shu mai were very good, and the shrimp in a spinach dumpling was fantastic. A definite don't miss is their sticky rice in lotus leaf. It's among the best I've had anywhere. Just be careful; you'll find bones in it every once in a while. Go for any of their steamed dumplings; they're very flavorful. As others have said, I love the Chinese broccoli, but you'll only find it on the carts on weekends. Otherwise order it off the menu.\nToday (11:30 lunch) the carts came around often, and everything except the pork buns was piping hot and fresh. By the way, despite the price increases, even the sticky rice was considered a medium size entree, and the two of us eating there escaped with a bill under $20 and we were done in under 30 minutes.\nI strongly recommend the dim sum here, whether you've had it a million times or have never had it before. You usually won't be disappointed.","I don't really understand the poor reviews on this place.....maybe it depends on the day you go? We went on a Sunday, it was crazy busy, but service was great! (of course, my view of customer service is a little different then the rest... I used to live on an island where you were just happy to find what you were looking for, let alone expect good customer service) Anyways, our server was very sweet! Always had a smile on her face. The carts served us promplty and none of the food was cold. They always had whatever we wanted (I hate having to wait for the next cart).\n\nNow, as for the actual dim sum and food.......holy cow, to die for! So flavorful and fresh!! The broccoli makes you sing...and the wine noodles, make you cry. You leave with very weird mixed emotions, but mostly a happy belly full of yummy food.\n\nIn my opinion, this is the best dim sum I have been able to find in Phx. I'm ditching my previous spot (Mekong Palace) and will be back to Golden Buddha when the dim sum monster strikes again!"],"type":["Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Medium Rating","Medium Rating","Medium Rating","Medium Rating","Medium Rating","Medium Rating","Medium Rating","Medium Rating","Medium Rating","Medium Rating","High Rating","High Rating","High Rating","High Rating","High Rating","High Rating","High Rating","High Rating","High Rating","High Rating","High Rating","High Rating","High Rating","High Rating","High Rating","High Rating"],"type_color":["#FEF5D6","#FEF5D6","#FEF5D6","#FEF5D6","#FEF5D6","#FEF5D6","#FEF5D6","#FEF5D6","#FEF5D6","#FEF5D6","#FEF5D6","#FEF5D6","#FEF5D6","#FEF5D6","#E39A73","#E39A73","#E39A73","#E39A73","#E39A73","#E39A73","#E39A73","#E39A73","#E39A73","#E39A73","#C01400","#C01400","#C01400","#C01400","#C01400","#C01400","#C01400","#C01400","#C01400","#C01400","#C01400","#C01400","#C01400","#C01400","#C01400","#C01400"]}},"id":"b714c51d-f5c1-431e-88b2-d959bb5adbf6","type":"ColumnDataSource"},{"attributes":{"text":{"field":"display"},"text_align":"center","text_alpha":{"value":0.1},"text_baseline":"middle","text_color":{"value":"black"},"text_font_size":{"value":"15pt"},"x":{"field":"symx"},"y":{"field":"namey"}},"id":"61f346d4-302c-460a-8604-6a36e2c8abdb","type":"Text"},{"attributes":{"data_source":{"id":"520bc126-ae52-4d85-b834-7eb9f1cb7706","type":"ColumnDataSource"},"glyph":{"id":"2c23637d-03be-4914-8a6a-a27103c96d28","type":"Rect"},"hover_glyph":null,"nonselection_glyph":{"id":"ab269c0a-5d7b-4ba5-afc8-d9145878ae08","type":"Rect"},"selection_glyph":null},"id":"da0111a4-f560-4916-8b7e-046061215878","type":"GlyphRenderer"},{"attributes":{"callback":null,"column_names":["symx","type","business_name","actual_review","display","period","error","business_rating","namey","text_review","type_color","group","pred_rating"],"data":{"actual_review":["1","1","1","1","2","2","2","3","3","5","5","5","5"],"business_name":["Pizza Parma","Pizza Parma","Pizza Parma","Pizza Parma","Pizza Parma","Pizza Parma","Pizza Parma","Pizza Parma","Pizza Parma","Pizza Parma","Pizza Parma","Pizza Parma","Pizza Parma"],"business_rating":[3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0],"display":["Stars : 1","Stars : 1","Stars : 1","Stars : 1","Stars : 2","Stars : 2","Stars : 2","Stars : 3","Stars : 3","Stars : 5","Stars : 5","Stars : 5","Stars : 5"],"error":["0","-4","-3","0","-3","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","0"],"group":["2","3","5","6","1","4","7","1","2","1","2","3","4"],"namey":["2:0.5","3:0.5","5:0.5","6:0.5","1:0.5","4:0.5","7:0.5","1:0.5","2:0.5","1:0.5","2:0.5","3:0.5","4:0.5"],"period":["Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Medium Rating","Medium Rating","High Rating","High Rating","High Rating","High Rating"],"pred_rating":["1","5","4","1","5","2","2","3","3","5","5","4","5"],"symx":["Low Rating:0.5","Low Rating:0.5","Low Rating:0.5","Low Rating:0.5","Low Rating:0.5","Low Rating:0.5","Low Rating:0.5","Medium Rating:0.5","Medium Rating:0.5","High Rating:0.5","High Rating:0.5","High Rating:0.5","High Rating:0.5"],"text_review":["Unfortunately this dump is right down the street from my hotel and not really having eaten much all day, I was hungry.\n\nThe service was terrible....no one knew what they were doing so it took 10 minutes to get a freaking slice of pizza and then when said pizza came it was NASTY.\n\nMy husband once got a pizza in Milwaukee where they put Kraft singles on it as cheese and Pizza Parma is just behind that for worst pizza ever.","Looking for a quick bite to eat and a local told me this was \"the best pizza in the city.\"  I got a plain slice and a pepperoni slice.

I ate half of the plain slice because I was starving....then threw both in the garbage.  \n\nIf this is really the best pizza in Pittsburgh... wow.","I ordered from Pizza Parma out of storm necessity. I ordered a chicken parmigiana \"hoagie\", which was dry and luke warm. The potato bacon soup was like something out of a can, except the chunks of potato were hard and undercooked..all pretty nasty and overly salty.\n\nNever order from them.","Zero stars. Came in 10 mins before close. Female manager on duty asked for $100 in exchange for a pizza. When we refused she said she could not serve us because her employees had been working since 9am..,it is currently 2:00 am... Sounds pretty illegal to me","Average pizza. But with ten guys working - and not much business at the moment - it still took twenty minutes to get a slice of pepperoni. I'll walk across the street next time.","My butthole hasn't been right for days, nor my stomach. \n\nWe ordered in because we all had a long day and were set to have a family movie night.\n\nA pizza and hoagie. \n\nThe hoagie wasn't anything to run and go scream from the rooftops about but the pizza was covered in little ass ruining intestinal demons and this I am nearly sure of.\n\nI had to be talked out of sending pizza Parma a bill for several rolls of toilet paper.\n\nBe weary of the pizza, distrustful actually.\n\nYour butthole will thank me for it!","Hubby and I dropped in after a hellish morning at the Social Security office. Hubby loves pizza so we made a stop.\n\nPizza wan't bad, it was actually pretty decent. But the place was disgusting and the cashier was incredibly rude.","I eat this pizza all the time when downtown, usually when running around at events like First Night or the Gallery Crawls...not the best pizza I have ever had in my life, but it's not bad!  And I haven't ever gotten sick from it.  Just wanted to offer a different opinion.","PIzza Parma's decent tasting mega-big-2ft-long hot sausage hoagie was let down by the piss poor attitude of the staff, the lack of cleanliness of the tables and floor, the out-of-order red door restroom, the bright yellow for no-explicable reason walls. \n\nThe large color-striped 80's retro tables and green chairs have come back in style but this win is purely accidental and achieved only by laziness and lack of renovation.\n\nThat is all.","My fiance & I have lived in downtown Pittsburgh for over a year + now & this place is fabulous. \nMy sweetie LOVES LOVES LOVESSS pizza & we order from here a ton.  We haven't ordered anything here that wasn't super tasty.\nThe shop is small & the decor is super bright which makes you want to get in & out quickly but who the hell eats in there anyways. ... you're grabbing your order & running.","I'm glad I listened to my friend's recommendation and not some of these bad reviews. We're just in town for the night and wanted something delivered to our hotel. They said it would take an hour, which I expected on Super Bowl Sunday right at game time, but it was here in less than half an hour. \n\nThe pizza was delicious! Just the right balance of cheese and a tasty sauce, generous with the toppings, and a nicely crispy crust but not too thin.","This place has great service! My best friend and I got 2 custom orders and the older guy in back came out to the register to take our orders personally.  I assume he's either the cook, owner, or both. We ordered 2 cheeselss pizzas; a lot of places mess this up. Pizza Parma however, makes great cheeseless pizza. Our personal pizzas were nice and toasty, not over nor undercooked, and it was not dried out at all! There was more than enough sauce mmmmmmmmm.","My fiance & I have lived in downtown Pittsburgh for over a year + now & this place is fabulous. \nMy sweetie LOVES LOVES LOVESSS pizza & we order from here a ton.

waiter was to be found about ten minutes later they gave us our water and left again! It wasn't even busy! There were only TWO dim sum carts floating around somewhere. Then our waiter finally came around and took our orders of lunch entrees. The food was not even that good as the reviews that are posted on here. When we came up to pay, the bill was super overpriced. I will not be returning here, I am better off eating at Great Wall Cuisine.","If this place had zero stars I would have given them that ! Let me start off by saying I was so excited to read all great reviews so maybe I just came in on a off day? We walked in and were seated came over and asked if we wanted water or tea I guess they don't serve anything Else, Then we placed an order pork dumplings and sticky rice nasty! Then I asked if they served egg rolls they said they were out!!! they pushed their little carts around with hot plates that basically steam the food and is not fresh and what you get is soggy poor customer service we had to get up and look for someone to give us our tab so we could get the heck out of there are get some real food. It looked like it would be a great place for groups of people would not recommend if you are on mission for what you want and want to place an order but it could be a fun experience for some people.","You walk into a Chinese restaurant on a Saturday afternoon for dim sum and you expect the place to be PACKED.  Well, walking in to a pretty much empty dining room, it's a VERY CLEAR SIGN.  But my friend insisted and I was very hesitant for good reasons.  Another indicator, the majority of the patrons were NON Asian.  \n\nFood: You walk in and you see carts of the food by the entrance to the dining room.  Umm, I thought dim sum should come right off the steamer and into the carts and they roll it around, not sitting around.  The dim sum was garbage.  It had the typical selection, but at minimum.  \n\nService: It's ok.  But it doesn't make up for the horrible food.\n\nBottom line: NO WAY!  Stay away!","I've been here many times...Mother's Day with family, dim sum with book club, etc. But I will not go back again.  I stopped in to ask the owner about a donation or reduced price for a class of under-privileged kids that I volunteer with.  His reaction was to scoff and shoo me out the door while handing me his card and saying I could email him.  He turned his back and headed off to the messy newspaper-strewn table he haunts between guests arrivals.  Maybe he's a community-minded business owner, but then again, maybe he's not.  I'll be dining elsewhere.","Being from Chicago, we are used to getting authentic Chinese food all the time.  But when we first starting spending a lot of time in Scottsdale/Phoenix, we found it a challenge to get authentic Chinese food.  We were excited to find the Golden Buddha and have made many trips over the years all the way from the Troon North area to get our fix.  However, service has declined to the point where it is no longer worth the aggravation.  We went there last night for Chinese New Year and will never go back.  Granted they were very busy because of a lot of large tables there, but waiting almost an hour to get our food is not acceptable under any circumstance!  45 mins. into our wait, the waitress came back (after we flagged her down to ask about our food) and said one of the dishes we ordered was not available....after 45 mins.!!!! What makes the whole experience an unforgivable one is that the manager/owner is so indifferent and never apologized or offered a discount off the bill...nothing.  When we left, the same manager was at the piano singing in Chinese. Huh?  Other than Nee House in Scottsdale, the search goes on for a restaurant that serves authentic Chinese food closer to home.","I will NEVER go there again.  I reserved a table for a group of 16 people for 5:00 PM on Christmas Eve .  The person on the phone ( I believe the manager) repeatedly asked me to call ahead and give him an accurate head count since he said they'd be swamped that day.  I followed up with him twice.  \nWhen the first couple of us arrived, we had menus shoved in our faces immediately and told we \"Must order now.  Must order now\" because they were going to be busy later on.  The place was practically empty.  As each person arrived, they were treated the same way. \nWe rushed and placed our orders and then they brought out our checks WAY before we saw any sign of our food.  I have never in my life been treated so rudely by a restaurant.\nIt was utter chaos when the food started coming out while everyone struggled to get the correct dish they ordered.  One person didn't get her food until we were all just about finished eating. \nOne top of all that, the food wasn't even good.  I've had better Kung Pao Chicken at Panda Express!\nAfter being rushed through our meal, the place wasn't even half full by the time we left.  I thought being at the Cultural Center, this restaurant would be a sure thing but boy was I wrong.  Lovely way to spend Christmas Eve..","If you are looking a chinese restaurant to host a big party look some other than the Golden Buddah.  I recently attended a banquet at the Golden Buddah and I was shocked at the level of quality of food and service.  Of the 10 dishes served 4 were nearly inedible.  \n\nThere was a crab claw appetizer, most chinese restaurants prepare this dish by taking a crab claw surrounding it with ground shrimp, batter and then deep fry.  At Golden Buddah, the crab claw served was mostly batter.  \n\nThe shark fin soup served was mostly broth.  Shark fin is an expensive ingredient and most places usually use imitation shark fin, but come on at least put something in there so that I know I'm eating soup and not dirty sink water.  \n\nGinger scallion lobster is battered, fried, and then stir fried in a sauce with ginger and scallions.  The ginger scallion lobster served was over-cooked and dried out.  \n\nLastly, there was a steamed fish.  The fish was raw in the middle.   \n\nIt wasn't all bad, there was a crispy chicken with garlic dish that was pretty good, but out of 10 dishes 4 were bad, 5 were okay, and 1 was good.  \n\nDoes 4 bad dishes out of 10 warrant a one star rating?  Well it does when you factor in the service.  The soup, appetizer, and first entree arrived timely, but after that there was a 1 hour gap before we received the next dish.  The dishes were not served with accompanying white rice which I thought was odd.  We had to ask for it, and even the rice took a while to arrive.","I agree with Crystal C., that the dim sum isn't the greatest I've ever had. In fact, I am not sure if the meal was so tasty that it was memorable. I do remember the \"calamari\" was not really calamari, like you would think. It was presented more like a sweet and sour pork (so calamari with LOTS of breading) without any sauce. As a result, the dish was dry and salty.\n\nThe sticky rice was good (hard to mess up), the chicken feet were okay (needed more five spice powder), and the shumai was alright. The noodles were good, and I can see why the cart ran out after the first round. The diners were an equal mix of Asians and Americans. I would've preferred to see more Asians eating (as I am used to in a Chinatown and gives an indication of authenticity), but I do realize we're in Phoenix where the Asian population is not like San Francisco or Houston. \n\nThe meal came to about $30 for two, including jasmine tea. The carts are loud because they are made out of metal and roll on tile. I am also not used to staff members shouting what they have in their cart, like a newspaper boy yelling \"Extra! Extra!\" Christmas music was playing after mid-January, so the atmosphere felt strange. Next time I visit the city, I probably will pass.","Can't say that I was very impressed. Came for dinner in a hopeful and enthusiastic mood since the reviews have been pretty good, but I don't think this place lives up to its current good, but declining rating.\n\nOrdered the Combo fried rice (shrimp, chicken, beef, pork), sesame chicken, and garlic fried chicken. \n\nThe combo fried rice was pretty good, but ended up drinking about 6 glasses of water due to the MSG and sodium content. You'd think that the cook spent his better years in the French Foreign Legion in the Sahara eating salt tablets and developed a taste for them. \n\nThe sesame chicken had a good flavor and a thick brown sweet sauce. I liked it a lot until it got cool and the sauce looked (with that stringy consistency) more like glue. You think I'm kidding? I'm not.\n\nGarlic fried chicken was bad. Just bad. It was like an over roasted dried out half chicken with some dried garlic pieces sprinkled on top. No spices, no flavor, no good. \n\nWe then got all kinds of lip from the waitress when we asked if they could change the channel on the TV from college football, to the Suns game. They made it into this big deal that the \"customers\" wanted to see the football game. Yeah right, it was University of West Virginia Vs. University of Connecticut! I would have believed it if it was a local team....\n\nIt's better than a 1 star joint, but only because it's borderline edible. To be avoided.","This restaurant is located in the Chinese Cultural Center and was the one restaurant that I had not been to. So after some shopping at one of the shops, we stepped in to have dinner.\n\nWe stepped in and asked for a seat for two. We were seated immediately. The place was decorated nicely and a lady playing the piano made for great ambiance.\n\nWe looked at the menu briefly and ordered our drinks, an appetizer, a soup and two main dishes. The drinks came out promptly and so did the rest of the meal. My goodness everything we ordered was very tasty.\n\nThe waiter service itself however was not even close to the decor and food. He never introduced himself, and although he took our order, our food itself was brought out by a kitchen person.\n\nAfter we ordered our waiter really never came back asking if we needed anything else, except to give us our check at the end and that was after the person I was dining with got up and asked a different waiter for it.\n\nIt's amazing how a place with great food, decor, and ambiance can mess it all up by crappy waiter service.","I love Dim Sum, my favorite Chinese dish.\n\nWhen Golden Buddha first open, they have excellent Dim sum. I went there many times, I tell my friend how good it is, But now,  they change cook, taste more like  week old left over. Rumor has it, they change cook every few month, so Quality of cooking change. (not sure if that is true, but that is what I was told.)\nMy advice is; when you walk in the door and the place is pack, = Good Cook. if the place is bare = bad cook. leave immediately. don't waste your money.","If you just \"want\" dim sum, go here. If you are \"craving\" dim sum, go elsewhere (take a 5 hour drive west to neighboring state, California).\n\nAnyway, I've been visiting Golden Buddha in the noontime for roughly 2 years now. I believe they moved from their original site (7th St. & Osborn), formerly \"China Doll.\" Relocation brought along better atmosphere and smiling faces. This does not mean, better dim sum. But since we are in Phoenix, I will settle for what they have to offer. \n\nBe mindful of the dim sum tab. It's itemized high-medium-low. \n\nShaomai can be found as combinations of pork/mushroom, shrimp, or shark fin (which should not be confused as true shark bits, as the shaomai is prepared to look like a shark's fin). These picks are okay...perhaps on a better day shao mai will be served in less-rigid, or fresher wrappers. Potstickers are okay as well, just the usual scallion and pork, and dry wrapper. The baby pork ribs in light black bean sauce and jalapenos is alright, but sometimes lacks in taste. Tripe is also served in its bare minimum...so if you enjoy the texture and flavor of tripe, try this with its clear sauce and thinly sliced carrots and celery.  \nBuche (that's what I call it), or fried sesame balls are also available, although if you wait until dessert, they will also be a bit stiff. There are a few other things that may be \"spotted\" but are not worth mentioning. \n\nDon't order from their lunch menu, as you can find these over-salted dishes at Panda Express anyway. \n\nOverall, dim sum at Golden Buddha is a place to go if you are around the vicinity and feel like having something apart from the usual fast food. However, discriminating palates- beware.","Not impressed with this place at all. This was not the friendliest place around, maybe because of the language barrier (most or all were clearly native Chinese speakers), or maybe just the attitude of the employees.\n\nI ordered the sweet and sour chicken lunch, which came with the typical egg drop soup, crab rangoon, and egg roll. The soup was ok - maybe it's just me, but I prefer a real spoon to the scoop that they gave me. The egg roll was tiny and not that great, and the crab rangoon was ok, but maybe a little undercooked. The chicken wasn't bad, but nothing special, as was the rice and other stuff on the plate.\n\nOverall, this was just not my kind of Chinese place.","Disappointing.  Mediocre at best.  I am staying at the Aloft hotel in phoenix and ordered some delivery. I ordered a couple american chinese food staples: general tso's chicken, dumplings and hot&sour soup.  Soup had zero flavor, dumplings tasted freezer burned and processed.  General tso chicken was ehh. \n\nA lot of good reviews on here so it must be for eat in and for their dim sum.  Don't order delivery, you will be left hungry and unsatisfied.","Went there on Saturday for early lunch.  My wife did the dim sum, it was okay, we were both disgusted by the sugar cane shrimp; but the rest was good.  \n\nI ordered the chicken szechwuan, the waitress warned me it was \"spicy\" the reason I ordered it.  It came out delicious, but not what I would call spicy.  Overall its hard to find good Chinese in the valley and I would call this good without hesitation.","So I was referred to this place from the front desk of my hotel. I'm from SF so I'm coming from a place with really good chinese food. \n\nThe dim sum is just \"ok\" nothing for me to write home about. The one dish that I really liked was the chinese broccoli cooked with garlic sauce. Yum yum yum.  It's in a big bowl, not oily, not saucy, just really good. I think it's $7.50.  \n\nIt's a somewhat pricey and just like all chinese restaurants, it's not the cleanest.  The chair was filthy.  the dishes weren't all that great.  I wouldn't go back unless I want the chinese broccoli.  \n\nSo I went on a Sunday and it was not crowded at all. There's not a huge asian population  in Phoenix (not that I could tell) so I don't think there's a high demand for dim sum.  And also, I sooooooo felt like taking a pic of this, but a Mexican lady was pushing one of the dim sum carts. That is unheard of in SF.  This is a mainly mandarin restaurant and the dim sum places I go are usually cantonese.  Not a big deal though since the dishes look the same. \n\nDude, there was a turtle in the fish tank that I saw as I left.  I hope they don't eat that!","A Premier Chinese Atmosphere,\nThe Chinese cultural center and Asian Garden produces an Asain atmosphere that can be recognized from the 202.  \n With Dim Sum served this location earns its respect from the local community.\n\nDim Sum tip,  You have to be smart with the Dim Sum ladies they look nice innocent but they are professional sales people that will sell you more dishes than you need before you know what to do.  \n\nI love the desserts here ask the server to see the dessert tray.","This restaurant has a bit of an identity crisis. It is in the Chinese cultural center, but serves Japanese beer (Kirin on tap!) and the live piano music is American pop. We had to ask for chopsticks.\n\nHaving said that, the service was professional. Our waiter held a hot appetizer for one of our party who was away from the table so that it would not be cold when he returned. We were asked frequently--and not too frequently--if things were ok both by our waiter and the manager/proprietor.\n\nThe food was ok-to-good. Fried shrimp egg rolls were dainty but yummy. Duck was tasty but very chewy. Kung-pao chicken was pleasantly spiced. Plenty of rice. A pitcher of ice water with lemon was left at the table. \n\nAtmosphere was also pleasant. Chairs comfortable, tables spaced well, restrooms large and clean...and there is indeed a large golden Buddha by the entrance.","I took a group of friends here and relatives other times. The place is consistently good for Dim-sum during lunch. It is typical Chinese and nothing fancy.\n\nWhat helps this place is the moat scenery.  3 stars for visiting here based on convenience since there are similar places in town.","Having grown up in Hong Kong and having eaten dim sum in London, NY, LA, SF and Vancouver (actually Richmond), I can confidently say I know my dim sum.\n\nGood selection of well-executed dim sum when the carts actually come around and there's anything left in it.  I'd give it 4 stars for food but the wait definitely detracted from the whole experience.\n\nI think the problem with Golden Buddha is that they can't handle the heavy flow on weekends.  There's not enough regular dim sum eaters like LA that can sustain a steady flow of diners throughout the week, forcing restaurants like Golden Buddha to depend heavily on extra part-time help on weekends.  \n\nDim sum takes serious skill so the chef still ends up doing most of the work.  When we looked into the kitchen, we saw a Chinese woman doing most of the cooking herself.  No wonder it took forever for a cart to come out and when it does, it's swarmed on by a pack of vultures.\n\nIf you're willing to eat at a more simply decorated place with a smaller menu, I'd highly recommend China Chan.  It's much more relaxed - usually no wait on weekends.  An experienced chef makes all the dim sum himself so the menu's much shorter but all the classics are on it.  Anything steamed is made to order so is very fresh.","Situated in the Chinese Cultural Center near the SkyHarbor Airport, this was another pleasant find. All I had was the Dim Sum menu, and I would say this is the best you're gonna get in Phoenix. Still worth the stop to get your Dim Sum fix. The cart ladies were pleasant and very happy to converse with me in Cantonese. Only downside was the chicken sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaves, naw mei gai, was way overcooked, and mushy.","Do you want to eat Chinese Food in an elegant environment on a Friday night in Phoenix? \n\nBe entertained by classic, quiet standards being played live on a piano while you dine?\n\nAre you 50 years old and Caucasian?\n\nThen the Golden Buddha is the place for you! \n\nIts in the Chinese Cultural Center Mall on 44th, and a popular weekend spot for Dim Sum. For a DIm Sum starved Valley of the Sun, Golden Buddha's is decent. \n\nFor dinner, though, it is awfully Americanized and not very authentic Chinese. But with a bunch of American customers coming for dinner, what do you expect? They probably think they are getting \"real Chinese\" food by going to the Chinese Mall, but then again, they are used to PF Chang's or Stix normally in their neighborhood, so this is a step up.\n\nThe best thing about this place is the decor, which is clean and nice, with a Hong Kong Junk boat design covering the ceiling from the bar into the dining room. The next best thing is the Piano interludes on weekend nights. The service is next, which is a little overly eager to remove your plate, and the last thing is the food. \n\nThey do give decent portions. I ordered Guo Teh (potstickers) and got 6 fat ones. But they weren't served with the usual soy, chili oil and vinegar, but a soy and green onions mixture. The Mapo Tofu was ok, as they used a nice silky tofu, which was nice, but no green onions, and sliced black mushrooms instead, which I like, but not in this dish.\n\nCome here for the ambiance and music in the evenings, or on the weekend days for Dim Sum.","Decent dim sum, especially to be found in the middle of the desert. Sadly, the best food I've had in Phoenix.","This place is a little difficult for me to review.  I was staying at the Hampton Inn across the street and this is the closest restaurant so off I went.\n\nI walked in and the owner or manager met me at the door and asked \"how many\"?\n\nI told him I wanted to order take out and handed me a menu and pointed to the waiting area which was covered in newspapers.  I chose to go to the bar, order a glass of wine, and peruse the menu.\n\nThe drinks are expensive but I didn't think the food was.  Less than $10 for my Mongolian Chicken which came with white sticky rice and a fortune cookie.  When ordering I asked if I could have fried rice instead of white rice but was told \"no\".  Most places allow this for a nominal fee.\n\nFine by me.  Give the white rice.  Food was prepared and their to-go boxes were a lot better than the standard white Chinese \"to go\" boxes.  They also included the plastic-ware, napkin, and soy sauce, which a lot of places forget.\n\nLooking around I found a whole lot of goodness along with a couple disappointments.  Most notably the newspaper strewn about and behind the bar, to the right were a lot of boxes stacked in an unsightly fashion.  I could have been a little more presentable in my opinion.\n\nI peeked into the dining room because I wanted to see if the piano music was piped in or live.  It was live which was very nice. Also, the dinning room looked very nice and cozy.\n\nAs I was leaving the same man who greeted me upon entering made sure to wish me a good evening.  My initial impression of the man was that he was surly and testy but that's just how he comes off.\n\nThe food was very good.  The Mongolian sauce was mixture of sweet with spice and the chicken and vegetables all tasted fresh.","My husband and I went there Saturday, the service was great!  Our friends were going to be late so they told us to start.  And start we did!\nThey were serving Dim Sum, something we had never tried, so glad we did, it was wonderful, hubby wouldn't do the chicken feet, but I think next time I will, it looked very good.\nOur friends showed up and ordered their food, and ate all of it, they said that usually they take food home, but it was so good they had to eat all of it!\nWe will be going back very soon!","Let's see, over 50... check \nold white man...........check \neats dinner ...............check \nlistens to the piano  check \n\nwow this must be the place for me, I mean after all it is in a Chinese mall, no make that a Chinese Cultural Center. How could I possibly have discerning taste with such trickery to get me here to eat. \nDude if you are going to rate a restaurant no need to degrade others with your arrogance. \nFool is my review of wanugee N. \n\nNow on the restaurant. The last time we were here the food was not good, the piano was too loud and the waitress had a real attitude. IT won't keep me from going back as I have had good meals and wait service too. \n\nBack to wanugee N. I do not expect any place in Phx. to have authentic Chinese food, by that I mean the street food one finds in China. \nBut I do expect what I fork in to my mouth is worth what I am going to fork over in cost. Even an old white guy like me can tell the difference between good and bad food. No matter what it is called.","Okay so Ive been glum the past few days as I have an impending birthday. Every year this time I get all down in the dumps.. not that I'm not happy with my life cause life is good. Its more like getting further away from my youth and closer to being well, old. All of my grandparents were crotchety, sourpuss drama queens.. is that my fate? Can I break the mold or am I to going to be a crotchety sourpuss?\n\nSo as I contemplate and figure out what I'm going to do with my birthday baggage I decide to squash it with food. All weekend Ive been eating out and having a good time. This is one of the few times outside of a vacation where I will live it completely and to the near of sheer gluttony. So why not dim sum? \n\nIve chowed much dim sum in my 36 years of earthen wear.. of course some good and some bad. I have never been to a place where every dish was great.. Golden Buddha is no exception to this.. they do the basics well enough and have enough funky cool Asian style to keep me interested in returning. The carts around 1130 flow well but around noon it' s full blown freeway action! In fact there might be some road kill in there based on some of the looks on that last steam cart.. \n\nMe and 3 others who were feeling my pain ordered 14, count them, 14 different dishes. One of my friends is from Georgia and had never had dim sum but he is so courageous and unflinching that he was just a blast. Just the shot in the arm to get me out of my funk. I remember the first time I had dim sum.. my eyes wide open, nostrils flared and excited to see what was under the next steamer lid. That was him today.. one exciting thing after the next.. he was even willing to try chicken feet but this is one of those dishes not done very well here. \n\nMy friend took me back to a time where I was younger and less experienced. He looked up to me to guide him through the noodles, bao and sui mai.. like a big brother.. I'm privileged that I could show him something new and exciting and he was so into it! So instead of feeling sorry for myself I felt experienced and useful.. that there is something I can give back to others.. that its not all about me and me aging but about what can be shared with others.\n\nThere is so much more to do, give and feel in this short time we are here.. and Ill do it to, one bite at a time.","The best to be found in land locked Arizona.  My favorite sticky rice is here.  They have dim sum every day, but not a huge selection, though you can order off the menu.  I think it is much bigger on the weekends.  I'm just happy I can get my fix 7 days a week.  Beautiful gardens to walk through, with fish ponds, and a 99 market next door!","I ate at Golden Buddha a few weeks ago.  We ate at the restaurant after a day at the zoo with our 4 year old and had a blast.  The piano bar played tunes for my daughter and the staff was more than accommodating.  The general tso chicken was better than anything I can get in Tucson.  The soup was chocked full of fresh, read FRESH, not canned, vegetables.  All in all, I was very satisfied with the meal and the service.  Plus the decor is very nice, clean and cheery. \n\nEat at Golden Buddha.","For those who gave this place low marks, forgive me. I really like this place. Now I haven't tried various dim sum places so I'm reserving the right to downgrade the place as needed. The variety of food is plentiful, and the carts just keep on coming. I love the steamed pork buns, and the shiu mai (not sure if I spelled that correctly). Yesterday, my favorite pick was the deep fried rolls of taro and shrimp. YUM! I have never ordered from their menu so I can only talk about their dim sum. My friends and I try to go eat dim sum almost every Sunday. It's a cheap way to try new foods, and if you don't like it, well.. you can get away with pushing it aside with minimal guilt. Give it a try! You might be surprised.","I like Golden Buddha, have taken many friends there for Dim Sum.  \nTry not to \"hit\" the dumpling cart to heavy; otherwise cannot finish it to the dessert cart (LOL).\nLove the jasmine tea and the staff willing to help you if you do not understand the what each item is.\nSingapore Rice Noodles a favorite, along with any of the shrimp dumplings; also the broccoli and green beans.\nOnly wish that the carts with eggplant stuffed with shrimp or green peppers with shrimp were not on \"heated\" carts; by the time it gets to you the food is cold.\nOnly concern is that went on 22MAY2010 at 1:30PM; there was a closed sign due to electricity???\nREVISED: 26MAY2010 - called this evening - looks like they are back open again.","I've been to the Golden Buddha on several occasions and it is my favorite, by far, for honest Chinese food. \nWhile I've sampled everything from their vegetarian to their beef, I love their mandarin chicken. More recently, I was delighted to relive the wonders of their Kung Pao Chicken and Beef with Broccoli. \nI absolutely love the egg drop soup and mini crab rangoons that come with the meal.","The very first time I went to Golden Buddha was with my BFF and it was our first dim sum experience. Little did I know this would forever change my life and eating experiences. Although I must admit that first time was a bit awkward.\n\nGB wisely takes reservations which was wonderful (even though it wasn't crazy busy). Our assorted dim sum plates were flavorful and fresh. And the carts seemed to be in constant rotation so we were never too far from a good selection.\n\nWhat really helps GB is its location. The Cofco Center is an experience in itself, where one can have herbs specially blended, select a fresh member of marine life to take home and cook or browse through a store with one of the largest selections of Buddhas and hand fans I've experienced outside of San Francisco.","I've been to Golden Buddha a few times and have not been disappointed. \n\nThey have a LARGE selection of Dim Sum and if you're not careful you can get carried away.\n\nTry and get there early and you'll get the best and most fresh selection.\nMake sure you walk around the garden when you're done.","Probably the most comprehensive Chinese menu in the Valley.  Pick from well over 100 dishes, but if you want the best order the Peking Duck.  Everything else is very good, but without a wow factor.  You'll see lots of Chinese people in this massive restaurant, which probably means they're doing a fine job in the kitchen.","I very much enjoyed eating here. Food was great. Fairly fast service. Wasn't expensive either for the 4 of us.","Golden Buddha has GREAT dim sum.  Their prices are reasonable and the staff is very polite wheeling their little carts.  I tend to go on the weekend because there is more selection but they do dim sum throughout the week.  They also have some very authentic dishes on the menu for those who are more of the adventurous types.  Be sure to say hello to the turtles the next time you go.","This place in the Chinese Cultural Center has a very pretty and elegant bar area. I was pleased to learn that they had some very reasonable and delicious happy hour snacks. This is a good place for a Pina Colada. I had one by myself along with some dumplings and fried shrimp appetizer. Sadly I never brought anyone else here with me. It was happy hour heaven but you know? A lot of my friends in AZ pretty much hang out in one neighborhood or another and nobody I know really lives close to the Buddha.\nThe airport is pretty close by. This might be a good pre-flight send-off location.","I have had dim sum in New Orleans and Phoenix (not SF), and this is about equal to the best of New Orleans as far as flavor.\nAs for ambiance, today was a good day. I've had dim sum here about a dozen times, and have had very good service and quality 90% of the time, including weekends. I have had bad days here, but since today was good, I'll rate accordingly. It's closer to a 4.5, but since I can't give half-stars, I rounded up.\nDon't expect me to give these the right names, but... I was less than impressed with the bbq pork balls. They tasted too much like honey and the beef was minimal. The bbq sauce tasted bottled. Outside of that, their herbal hot tea is delicious even on a hot day.\nThe shu mai were very good, and the shrimp in a spinach dumpling was fantastic. A definite don't miss is their sticky rice in lotus leaf. It's among the best I've had anywhere. Just be careful; you'll find bones in it every once in a while. Go for any of their steamed dumplings; they're very flavorful. As others have said, I love the Chinese broccoli, but you'll only find it on the carts on weekends. Otherwise order it off the menu.\nToday (11:30 lunch) the carts came around often, and everything except the pork buns was piping hot and fresh. By the way, despite the price increases, even the sticky rice was considered a medium size entree, and the two of us eating there escaped with a bill under $20 and we were done in under 30 minutes.\nI strongly recommend the dim sum here, whether you've had it a million times or have never had it before. You usually won't be disappointed.","I don't really understand the poor reviews on this place.....maybe it depends on the day you go? We went on a Sunday, it was crazy busy, but service was great! (of course, my view of customer service is a little different then the rest... I used to live on an island where you were just happy to find what you were looking for, let alone expect good customer service) Anyways, our server was very sweet! Always had a smile on her face. The carts served us promplty and none of the food was cold. They always had whatever we wanted (I hate having to wait for the next cart).\n\nNow, as for the actual dim sum and food.......holy cow, to die for! So flavorful and fresh!! The broccoli makes you sing...and the wine noodles, make you cry. You leave with very weird mixed emotions, but mostly a happy belly full of yummy food.\n\nIn my opinion, this is the best dim sum I have been able to find in Phx. I'm ditching my previous spot (Mekong Palace) and will be back to Golden Buddha when the dim sum monster strikes again!"],"type":["Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low

waiter was to be found about ten minutes later they gave us our water and left again! It wasn't even busy! There were only TWO dim sum carts floating around somewhere. Then our waiter finally came around and took our orders of lunch entrees. The food was not even that good as the reviews that are posted on here. When we came up to pay, the bill was super overpriced. I will not be returning here, I am better off eating at Great Wall Cuisine.","If this place had zero stars I would have given them that ! Let me start off by saying I was so excited to read all great reviews so maybe I just came in on a off day? We walked in and were seated came over and asked if we wanted water or tea I guess they don't serve anything Else, Then we placed an order pork dumplings and sticky rice nasty! Then I asked if they served egg rolls they said they were out!!! they pushed their little carts around with hot plates that basically steam the food and is not fresh and what you get is soggy poor customer service we had to get up and look for someone to give us our tab so we could get the heck out of there are get some real food. It looked like it would be a great place for groups of people would not recommend if you are on mission for what you want and want to place an order but it could be a fun experience for some people.","You walk into a Chinese restaurant on a Saturday afternoon for dim sum and you expect the place to be PACKED.  Well, walking in to a pretty much empty dining room, it's a VERY CLEAR SIGN.  But my friend insisted and I was very hesitant for good reasons.  Another indicator, the majority of the patrons were NON Asian.  \n\nFood: You walk in and you see carts of the food by the entrance to the dining room.  Umm, I thought dim sum should come right off the steamer and into the carts and they roll it around, not sitting around.  The dim sum was garbage.  It had the typical selection, but at minimum.  \n\nService: It's ok.  But it doesn't make up for the horrible food.\n\nBottom line: NO WAY!  Stay away!","I've been here many times...Mother's Day with family, dim sum with book club, etc. But I will not go back again.  I stopped in to ask the owner about a donation or reduced price for a class of under-privileged kids that I volunteer with.  His reaction was to scoff and shoo me out the door while handing me his card and saying I could email him.  He turned his back and headed off to the messy newspaper-strewn table he haunts between guests arrivals.  Maybe he's a community-minded business owner, but then again, maybe he's not.  I'll be dining elsewhere.","Being from Chicago, we are used to getting authentic Chinese food all the time.  But when we first starting spending a lot of time in Scottsdale/Phoenix, we found it a challenge to get authentic Chinese food.  We were excited to find the Golden Buddha and have made many trips over the years all the way from the Troon North area to get our fix.  However, service has declined to the point where it is no longer worth the aggravation.  We went there last night for Chinese New Year and will never go back.  Granted they were very busy because of a lot of large tables there, but waiting almost an hour to get our food is not acceptable under any circumstance!  45 mins. into our wait, the waitress came back (after we flagged her down to ask about our food) and said one of the dishes we ordered was not available....after 45 mins.!!!! What makes the whole experience an unforgivable one is that the manager/owner is so indifferent and never apologized or offered a discount off the bill...nothing.  When we left, the same manager was at the piano singing in Chinese. Huh?  Other than Nee House in Scottsdale, the search goes on for a restaurant that serves authentic Chinese food closer to home.","I will NEVER go there again.  I reserved a table for a group of 16 people for 5:00 PM on Christmas Eve .  The person on the phone ( I believe the manager) repeatedly asked me to call ahead and give him an accurate head count since he said they'd be swamped that day.  I followed up with him twice.  \nWhen the first couple of us arrived, we had menus shoved in our faces immediately and told we \"Must order now.  Must order now\" because they were going to be busy later on.  The place was practically empty.  As each person arrived, they were treated the same way. \nWe rushed and placed our orders and then they brought out our checks WAY before we saw any sign of our food.  I have never in my life been treated so rudely by a restaurant.\nIt was utter chaos when the food started coming out while everyone struggled to get the correct dish they ordered.  One person didn't get her food until we were all just about finished eating. \nOne top of all that, the food wasn't even good.  I've had better Kung Pao Chicken at Panda Express!\nAfter being rushed through our meal, the place wasn't even half full by the time we left.  I thought being at the Cultural Center, this restaurant would be a sure thing but boy was I wrong.  Lovely way to spend Christmas Eve..","If you are looking a chinese restaurant to host a big party look some other than the Golden Buddah.  I recently attended a banquet at the Golden Buddah and I was shocked at the level of quality of food and service.  Of the 10 dishes served 4 were nearly inedible.  \n\nThere was a crab claw appetizer, most chinese restaurants prepare this dish by taking a crab claw surrounding it with ground shrimp, batter and then deep fry.  At Golden Buddah, the crab claw served was mostly batter.  \n\nThe shark fin soup served was mostly broth.  Shark fin is an expensive ingredient and most places usually use imitation shark fin, but come on at least put something in there so that I know I'm eating soup and not dirty sink water.  \n\nGinger scallion lobster is battered, fried, and then stir fried in a sauce with ginger and scallions.  The ginger scallion lobster served was over-cooked and dried out.  \n\nLastly, there was a steamed fish.  The fish was raw in the middle.   \n\nIt wasn't all bad, there was a crispy chicken with garlic dish that was pretty good, but out of 10 dishes 4 were bad, 5 were okay, and 1 was good.  \n\nDoes 4 bad dishes out of 10 warrant a one star rating?  Well it does when you factor in the service.  The soup, appetizer, and first entree arrived timely, but after that there was a 1 hour gap before we received the next dish.  The dishes were not served with accompanying white rice which I thought was odd.  We had to ask for it, and even the rice took a while to arrive.","I agree with Crystal C., that the dim sum isn't the greatest I've ever had. In fact, I am not sure if the meal was so tasty that it was memorable. I do remember the \"calamari\" was not really calamari, like you would think. It was presented more like a sweet and sour pork (so calamari with LOTS of breading) without any sauce. As a result, the dish was dry and salty.\n\nThe sticky rice was good (hard to mess up), the chicken feet were okay (needed more five spice powder), and the shumai was alright. The noodles were good, and I can see why the cart ran out after the first round. The diners were an equal mix of Asians and Americans. I would've preferred to see more Asians eating (as I am used to in a Chinatown and gives an indication of authenticity), but I do realize we're in Phoenix where the Asian population is not like San Francisco or Houston. \n\nThe meal came to about $30 for two, including jasmine tea. The carts are loud because they are made out of metal and roll on tile. I am also not used to staff members shouting what they have in their cart, like a newspaper boy yelling \"Extra! Extra!\" Christmas music was playing after mid-January, so the atmosphere felt strange. Next time I visit the city, I probably will pass.","Can't say that I was very impressed. Came for dinner in a hopeful and enthusiastic mood since the reviews have been pretty good, but I don't think this place lives up to its current good, but declining rating.\n\nOrdered the Combo fried rice (shrimp, chicken, beef, pork), sesame chicken, and garlic fried chicken. \n\nThe combo fried rice was pretty good, but ended up drinking about 6 glasses of water due to the MSG and sodium content. You'd think that the cook spent his better years in the French Foreign Legion in the Sahara eating salt tablets and developed a taste for them. \n\nThe sesame chicken had a good flavor and a thick brown sweet sauce. I liked it a lot until it got cool and the sauce looked (with that stringy consistency) more like glue. You think I'm kidding? I'm not.\n\nGarlic fried chicken was bad. Just bad. It was like an over roasted dried out half chicken with some dried garlic pieces sprinkled on top. No spices, no flavor, no good. \n\nWe then got all kinds of lip from the waitress when we asked if they could change the channel on the TV from college football, to the Suns game. They made it into this big deal that the \"customers\" wanted to see the football game. Yeah right, it was University of West Virginia Vs. University of Connecticut! I would have believed it if it was a local team....\n\nIt's better than a 1 star joint, but only because it's borderline edible. To be avoided.","This restaurant is located in the Chinese Cultural Center and was the one restaurant that I had not been to. So after some shopping at one of the shops, we stepped in to have dinner.\n\nWe stepped in and asked for a seat for two. We were seated immediately. The place was decorated nicely and a lady playing the piano made for great ambiance.\n\nWe looked at the menu briefly and ordered our drinks, an appetizer, a soup and two main dishes. The drinks came out promptly and so did the rest of the meal. My goodness everything we ordered was very tasty.\n\nThe waiter service itself however was not even close to the decor and food. He never introduced himself, and although he took our order, our food itself was brought out by a kitchen person.\n\nAfter we ordered our waiter really never came back asking if we needed anything else, except to give us our check at the end and that was after the person I was dining with got up and asked a different waiter for it.\n\nIt's amazing how a place with great food, decor, and ambiance can mess it all up by crappy waiter service.","I love Dim Sum, my favorite Chinese dish.\n\nWhen Golden Buddha first open, they have excellent Dim sum. I went there many times, I tell my friend how good it is, But now,  they change cook, taste more like  week old left over. Rumor has it, they change cook every few month, so Quality of cooking change. (not sure if that is true, but that is what I was told.)\nMy advice is; when you walk in the door and the place is pack, = Good Cook. if the place is bare = bad cook. leave immediately. don't waste your money.","If you just \"want\" dim sum, go here. If you are \"craving\" dim sum, go elsewhere (take a 5 hour drive west to neighboring state, California).\n\nAnyway, I've been visiting Golden Buddha in the noontime for roughly 2 years now. I believe they moved from their original site (7th St. & Osborn), formerly \"China Doll.\" Relocation brought along better atmosphere and smiling faces. This does not mean, better dim sum. But since we are in Phoenix, I will settle for what they have to offer. \n\nBe mindful of the dim sum tab. It's itemized high-medium-low. \n\nShaomai can be found as combinations of pork/mushroom, shrimp, or shark fin (which should not be confused as true shark bits, as the shaomai is prepared to look like a shark's fin). These picks are okay...perhaps on a better day shao mai will be served in less-rigid, or fresher wrappers. Potstickers are okay as well, just the usual scallion and pork, and dry wrapper. The baby pork ribs in light black bean sauce and jalapenos is alright, but sometimes lacks in taste. Tripe is also served in its bare minimum...so if you enjoy the texture and flavor of tripe, try this with its clear sauce and thinly sliced carrots and celery.  \nBuche (that's what I call it), or fried sesame balls are also available, although if you wait until dessert, they will also be a bit stiff. There are a few other things that may be \"spotted\" but are not worth mentioning. \n\nDon't order from their lunch menu, as you can find these over-salted dishes at Panda Express anyway. \n\nOverall, dim sum at Golden Buddha is a place to go if you are around the vicinity and feel like having something apart from the usual fast food. However, discriminating palates- beware.","Not impressed with this place at all. This was not the friendliest place around, maybe because of the language barrier (most or all were clearly native Chinese speakers), or maybe just the attitude of the employees.\n\nI ordered the sweet and sour chicken lunch, which came with the typical egg drop soup, crab rangoon, and egg roll. The soup was ok - maybe it's just me, but I prefer a real spoon to the scoop that they gave me. The egg roll was tiny and not that great, and the crab rangoon was ok, but maybe a little undercooked. The chicken wasn't bad, but nothing special, as was the rice and other stuff on the plate.\n\nOverall, this was just not my kind of Chinese place.","Disappointing.  Mediocre at best.  I am staying at the Aloft hotel in phoenix and ordered some delivery. I ordered a couple american chinese food staples: general tso's chicken, dumplings and hot&sour soup.  Soup had zero flavor, dumplings tasted freezer burned and processed.  General tso chicken was ehh. \n\nA lot of good reviews on here so it must be for eat in and for their dim sum.  Don't order delivery, you will be left hungry and unsatisfied.","Went there on Saturday for early lunch.  My wife did the dim sum, it was okay, we were both disgusted by the sugar cane shrimp; but the rest was good.  \n\nI ordered the chicken szechwuan, the waitress warned me it was \"spicy\" the reason I ordered it.  It came out delicious, but not what I would call spicy.  Overall its hard to find good Chinese in the valley and I would call this good without hesitation.","So I was referred to this place from the front desk of my hotel. I'm from SF so I'm coming from a place with really good chinese food. \n\nThe dim sum is just \"ok\" nothing for me to write home about. The one dish that I really liked was the chinese broccoli cooked with garlic sauce. Yum yum yum.  It's in a big bowl, not oily, not saucy, just really good. I think it's $7.50.  \n\nIt's a somewhat pricey and just like all chinese restaurants, it's not the cleanest.  The chair was filthy.  the dishes weren't all that great.  I wouldn't go back unless I want the chinese broccoli.  \n\nSo I went on a Sunday and it was not crowded at all. There's not a huge asian population  in Phoenix (not that I could tell) so I don't think there's a high demand for dim sum.  And also, I sooooooo felt like taking a pic of this, but a Mexican lady was pushing one of the dim sum carts. That is unheard of in SF.  This is a mainly mandarin restaurant and the dim sum places I go are usually cantonese.  Not a big deal though since the dishes look the same. \n\nDude, there was a turtle in the fish tank that I saw as I left.  I hope they don't eat that!","A Premier Chinese Atmosphere,\nThe Chinese cultural center and Asian Garden produces an Asain atmosphere that can be recognized from the 202.  \n With Dim Sum served this location earns its respect from the local community.\n\nDim Sum tip,  You have to be smart with the Dim Sum ladies they look nice innocent but they are professional sales people that will sell you more dishes than you need before you know what to do.  \n\nI love the desserts here ask the server to see the dessert tray.","This restaurant has a bit of an identity crisis. It is in the Chinese cultural center, but serves Japanese beer (Kirin on tap!) and the live piano music is American pop. We had to ask for chopsticks.\n\nHaving said that, the service was professional. Our waiter held a hot appetizer for one of our party who was away from the table so that it would not be cold when he returned. We were asked frequently--and not too frequently--if things were ok both by our waiter and the manager/proprietor.\n\nThe food was ok-to-good. Fried shrimp egg rolls were dainty but yummy. Duck was tasty but very chewy. Kung-pao chicken was pleasantly spiced. Plenty of rice. A pitcher of ice water with lemon was left at the table. \n\nAtmosphere was also pleasant. Chairs comfortable, tables spaced well, restrooms large and clean...and there is indeed a large golden Buddha by the entrance.","I took a group of friends here and relatives other times. The place is consistently good for Dim-sum during lunch. It is typical Chinese and nothing fancy.\n\nWhat helps this place is the moat scenery.  3 stars for visiting here based on convenience since there are similar places in town.","Having grown up in Hong Kong and having eaten dim sum in London, NY, LA, SF and Vancouver (actually Richmond), I can confidently say I know my dim sum.\n\nGood selection of well-executed dim sum when the carts actually come around and there's anything left in it.  I'd give it 4 stars for food but the wait definitely detracted from the whole experience.\n\nI think the problem with Golden Buddha is that they can't handle the heavy flow on weekends.  There's not enough regular dim sum eaters like LA that can sustain a steady flow of diners throughout the week, forcing restaurants like Golden Buddha to depend heavily on extra part-time help on weekends.  \n\nDim sum takes serious skill so the chef still ends up doing most of the work.  When we looked into the kitchen, we saw a Chinese woman doing most of the cooking herself.  No wonder it took forever for a cart to come out and when it does, it's swarmed on by a pack of vultures.\n\nIf you're willing to eat at a more simply decorated place with a smaller menu, I'd highly recommend China Chan.  It's much more relaxed - usually no wait on weekends.  An experienced chef makes all the dim sum himself so the menu's much shorter but all the classics are on it.  Anything steamed is made to order so is very fresh.","Situated in the Chinese Cultural Center near the SkyHarbor Airport, this was another pleasant find. All I had was the Dim Sum menu, and I would say this is the best you're gonna get in Phoenix. Still worth the stop to get your Dim Sum fix. The cart ladies were pleasant and very happy to converse with me in Cantonese. Only downside was the chicken sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaves, naw mei gai, was way overcooked, and mushy.","Do you want to eat Chinese Food in an elegant environment on a Friday night in Phoenix? \n\nBe entertained by classic, quiet standards being played live on a piano while you dine?\n\nAre you 50 years old and Caucasian?\n\nThen the Golden Buddha is the place for you! \n\nIts in the Chinese Cultural Center Mall on 44th, and a popular weekend spot for Dim Sum. For a DIm Sum starved Valley of the Sun, Golden Buddha's is decent. \n\nFor dinner, though, it is awfully Americanized and not very authentic Chinese. But with a bunch of American customers coming for dinner, what do you expect? They probably think they are getting \"real Chinese\" food by going to the Chinese Mall, but then again, they are used to PF Chang's or Stix normally in their neighborhood, so this is a step up.\n\nThe best thing about this place is the decor, which is clean and nice, with a Hong Kong Junk boat design covering the ceiling from the bar into the dining room. The next best thing is the Piano interludes on weekend nights. The service is next, which is a little overly eager to remove your plate, and the last thing is the food. \n\nThey do give decent portions. I ordered Guo Teh (potstickers) and got 6 fat ones. But they weren't served with the usual soy, chili oil and vinegar, but a soy and green onions mixture. The Mapo Tofu was ok, as they used a nice silky tofu, which was nice, but no green onions, and sliced black mushrooms instead, which I like, but not in this dish.\n\nCome here for the ambiance and music in the evenings, or on the weekend days for Dim Sum.","Decent dim sum, especially to be found in the middle of the desert. Sadly, the best food I've had in Phoenix.","This place is a little difficult for me to review.  I was staying at the Hampton Inn across the street and this is the closest restaurant so off I went.\n\nI walked in and the owner or manager met me at the door and asked \"how many\"?\n\nI told him I wanted to order take out and handed me a menu and pointed to the waiting area which was covered in newspapers.  I chose to go to the bar, order a glass of wine, and peruse the menu.\n\nThe drinks are expensive but I didn't think the food was.  Less than $10 for my Mongolian Chicken which came with white sticky rice and a fortune cookie.  When ordering I asked if I could have fried rice instead of white rice but was told \"no\".  Most places allow this for a nominal fee.\n\nFine by me.  Give the white rice.  Food was prepared and their to-go boxes were a lot better than the standard white Chinese \"to go\" boxes.  They also included the plastic-ware, napkin, and soy sauce, which a lot of places forget.\n\nLooking around I found a whole lot of goodness along with a couple disappointments.  Most notably the newspaper strewn about and behind the bar, to the right were a lot of boxes stacked in an unsightly fashion.  I could have been a little more presentable in my opinion.\n\nI peeked into the dining room because I wanted to see if the piano music was piped in or live.  It was live which was very nice. Also, the dinning room looked very nice and cozy.\n\nAs I was leaving the same man who greeted me upon entering made sure to wish me a good evening.  My initial impression of the man was that he was surly and testy but that's just how he comes off.\n\nThe food was very good.  The Mongolian sauce was mixture of sweet with spice and the chicken and vegetables all tasted fresh.","My husband and I went there Saturday, the service was great!  Our friends were going to be late so they told us to start.  And start we did!\nThey were serving Dim Sum, something we had never tried, so glad we did, it was wonderful, hubby wouldn't do the chicken feet, but I think next time I will, it looked very good.\nOur friends showed up and ordered their food, and ate all of it, they said that usually they take food home, but it was so good they had to eat all of it!\nWe will be going back very soon!","Let's see, over 50... check \nold white man...........check \neats dinner ...............check \nlistens to the piano  check \n\nwow this must be the place for me, I mean after all it is in a Chinese mall, no make that a Chinese Cultural Center. How could I possibly have discerning taste with such trickery to get me here to eat. \nDude if you are going to rate a restaurant no need to degrade others with your arrogance. \nFool is my review of wanugee N. \n\nNow on the restaurant. The last time we were here the food was not good, the piano was too loud and the waitress had a real attitude. IT won't keep me from going back as I have had good meals and wait service too. \n\nBack to wanugee N. I do not expect any place in Phx. to have authentic Chinese food, by that I mean the street food one finds in China. \nBut I do expect what I fork in to my mouth is worth what I am going to fork over in cost. Even an old white guy like me can tell the difference between good and bad food. No matter what it is called.","Okay so Ive been glum the past few days as I have an impending birthday. Every year this time I get all down in the dumps.. not that I'm not happy with my life cause life is good. Its more like getting further away from my youth and closer to being well, old. All of my grandparents were crotchety, sourpuss drama queens.. is that my fate? Can I break the mold or am I to going to be a crotchety sourpuss?\n\nSo as I contemplate and figure out what I'm going to do with my birthday baggage I decide to squash it with food. All weekend Ive been eating out and having a good time. This is one of the few times outside of a vacation where I will live it completely and to the near of sheer gluttony. So why not dim sum? \n\nIve chowed much dim sum in my 36 years of earthen wear.. of course some good and some bad. I have never been to a place where every dish was great.. Golden Buddha is no exception to this.. they do the basics well enough and have enough funky cool Asian style to keep me interested in returning. The carts around 1130 flow well but around noon it' s full blown freeway action! In fact there might be some road kill in there based on some of the looks on that last steam cart.. \n\nMe and 3 others who were feeling my pain ordered 14, count them, 14 different dishes. One of my friends is from Georgia and had never had dim sum but he is so courageous and unflinching that he was just a blast. Just the shot in the arm to get me out of my funk. I remember the first time I had dim sum.. my eyes wide open, nostrils flared and excited to see what was under the next steamer lid. That was him today.. one exciting thing after the next.. he was even willing to try chicken feet but this is one of those dishes not done very well here. \n\nMy friend took me back to a time where I was younger and less experienced. He looked up to me to guide him through the noodles, bao and sui mai.. like a big brother.. I'm privileged that I could show him something new and exciting and he was so into it! So instead of feeling sorry for myself I felt experienced and useful.. that there is something I can give back to others.. that its not all about me and me aging but about what can be shared with others.\n\nThere is so much more to do, give and feel in this short time we are here.. and Ill do it to, one bite at a time.","The best to be found in land locked Arizona.  My favorite sticky rice is here.  They have dim sum every day, but not a huge selection, though you can order off the menu.  I think it is much bigger on the weekends.  I'm just happy I can get my fix 7 days a week.  Beautiful gardens to walk through, with fish ponds, and a 99 market next door!","I ate at Golden Buddha a few weeks ago.  We ate at the restaurant after a day at the zoo with our 4 year old and had a blast.  The piano bar played tunes for my daughter and the staff was more than accommodating.  The general tso chicken was better than anything I can get in Tucson.  The soup was chocked full of fresh, read FRESH, not canned, vegetables.  All in all, I was very satisfied with the meal and the service.  Plus the decor is very nice, clean and cheery. \n\nEat at Golden Buddha.","For those who gave this place low marks, forgive me. I really like this place. Now I haven't tried various dim sum places so I'm reserving the right to downgrade the place as needed. The variety of food is plentiful, and the carts just keep on coming. I love the steamed pork buns, and the shiu mai (not sure if I spelled that correctly). Yesterday, my favorite pick was the deep fried rolls of taro and shrimp. YUM! I have never ordered from their menu so I can only talk about their dim sum. My friends and I try to go eat dim sum almost every Sunday. It's a cheap way to try new foods, and if you don't like it, well.. you can get away with pushing it aside with minimal guilt. Give it a try! You might be surprised.","I like Golden Buddha, have taken many friends there for Dim Sum.  \nTry not to \"hit\" the dumpling cart to heavy; otherwise cannot finish it to the dessert cart (LOL).\nLove the jasmine tea and the staff willing to help you if you do not understand the what each item is.\nSingapore Rice Noodles a favorite, along with any of the shrimp dumplings; also the broccoli and green beans.\nOnly wish that the carts with eggplant stuffed with shrimp or green peppers with shrimp were not on \"heated\" carts; by the time it gets to you the food is cold.\nOnly concern is that went on 22MAY2010 at 1:30PM; there was a closed sign due to electricity???\nREVISED: 26MAY2010 - called this evening - looks like they are back open again.","I've been to the Golden Buddha on several occasions and it is my favorite, by far, for honest Chinese food. \nWhile I've sampled everything from their vegetarian to their beef, I love their mandarin chicken. More recently, I was delighted to relive the wonders of their Kung Pao Chicken and Beef with Broccoli. \nI absolutely love the egg drop soup and mini crab rangoons that come with the meal.","The very first time I went to Golden Buddha was with my BFF and it was our first dim sum experience. Little did I know this would forever change my life and eating experiences. Although I must admit that first time was a bit awkward.\n\nGB wisely takes reservations which was wonderful (even though it wasn't crazy busy). Our assorted dim sum plates were flavorful and fresh. And the carts seemed to be in constant rotation so we were never too far from a good selection.\n\nWhat really helps GB is its location. The Cofco Center is an experience in itself, where one can have herbs specially blended, select a fresh member of marine life to take home and cook or browse through a store with one of the largest selections of Buddhas and hand fans I've experienced outside of San Francisco.","I've been to Golden Buddha a few times and have not been disappointed. \n\nThey have a LARGE selection of Dim Sum and if you're not careful you can get carried away.\n\nTry and get there early and you'll get the best and most fresh selection.\nMake sure you walk around the garden when you're done.","Probably the most comprehensive Chinese menu in the Valley.  Pick from well over 100 dishes, but if you want the best order the Peking Duck.  Everything else is very good, but without a wow factor.  You'll see lots of Chinese people in this massive restaurant, which probably means they're doing a fine job in the kitchen.","I very much enjoyed eating here. Food was great. Fairly fast service. Wasn't expensive either for the 4 of us.","Golden Buddha has GREAT dim sum.  Their prices are reasonable and the staff is very polite wheeling their little carts.  I tend to go on the weekend because there is more selection but they do dim sum throughout the week.  They also have some very authentic dishes on the menu for those who are more of the adventurous types.  Be sure to say hello to the turtles the next time you go.","This place in the Chinese Cultural Center has a very pretty and elegant bar area. I was pleased to learn that they had some very reasonable and delicious happy hour snacks. This is a good place for a Pina Colada. I had one by myself along with some dumplings and fried shrimp appetizer. Sadly I never brought anyone else here with me. It was happy hour heaven but you know? A lot of my friends in AZ pretty much hang out in one neighborhood or another and nobody I know really lives close to the Buddha.\nThe airport is pretty close by. This might be a good pre-flight send-off location.","I have had dim sum in New Orleans and Phoenix (not SF), and this is about equal to the best of New Orleans as far as flavor.\nAs for ambiance, today was a good day. I've had dim sum here about a dozen times, and have had very good service and quality 90% of the time, including weekends. I have had bad days here, but since today was good, I'll rate accordingly. It's closer to a 4.5, but since I can't give half-stars, I rounded up.\nDon't expect me to give these the right names, but... I was less than impressed with the bbq pork balls. They tasted too much like honey and the beef was minimal. The bbq sauce tasted bottled. Outside of that, their herbal hot tea is delicious even on a hot day.\nThe shu mai were very good, and the shrimp in a spinach dumpling was fantastic. A definite don't miss is their sticky rice in lotus leaf. It's among the best I've had anywhere. Just be careful; you'll find bones in it every once in a while. Go for any of their steamed dumplings; they're very flavorful. As others have said, I love the Chinese broccoli, but you'll only find it on the carts on weekends. Otherwise order it off the menu.\nToday (11:30 lunch) the carts came around often, and everything except the pork buns was piping hot and fresh. By the way, despite the price increases, even the sticky rice was considered a medium size entree, and the two of us eating there escaped with a bill under $20 and we were done in under 30 minutes.\nI strongly recommend the dim sum here, whether you've had it a million times or have never had it before. You usually won't be disappointed.","I don't really understand the poor reviews on this place.....maybe it depends on the day you go? We went on a Sunday, it was crazy busy, but service was great! (of course, my view of customer service is a little different then the rest... I used to live on an island where you were just happy to find what you were looking for, let alone expect good customer service) Anyways, our server was very sweet! Always had a smile on her face. The carts served us promplty and none of the food was cold. They always had whatever we wanted (I hate having to wait for the next cart).\n\nNow, as for the actual dim sum and food.......holy cow, to die for! So flavorful and fresh!! The broccoli makes you sing...and the wine noodles, make you cry. You leave with very weird mixed emotions, but mostly a happy belly full of yummy food.\n\nIn my opinion, this is the best dim sum I have been able to find in Phx. I'm ditching my previous spot (Mekong Palace) and will be back to Golden Buddha when the dim sum monster strikes again!"],"type":["Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low

hotel and not really having eaten much all day, I was hungry.\n\nThe service was terrible....no one knew what they were doing so it took 10 minutes to get a freaking slice of pizza and then when said pizza came it was NASTY.\n\nMy husband once got a pizza in Milwaukee where they put Kraft singles on it as cheese and Pizza Parma is just behind that for worst pizza ever.","Looking for a quick bite to eat and a local told me this was \"the best pizza in the city.\"  I got a plain slice and a pepperoni slice. Possibly the worst pizza I have ever eaten.  This wouldn't even qualify as pizza in North Jersey.  I ate half of the plain slice because I was starving....then threw both in the garbage.  \n\nIf this is really the best pizza in Pittsburgh... wow.","I ordered from Pizza Parma out of storm necessity. I ordered a chicken parmigiana \"hoagie\", which was dry and luke warm. The potato bacon soup was like something out of a can, except the chunks of potato were hard and undercooked..all pretty nasty and overly salty.\n\nNever order from them.","Zero stars. Came in 10 mins before close. Female manager on duty asked for $100 in exchange for a pizza. When we refused she said she could not serve us because her employees had been working since 9am..,it is currently 2:00 am... Sounds pretty illegal to me","Average pizza. But with ten guys working - and not much business at the moment - it still took twenty minutes to get a slice of pepperoni. I'll walk across the street next time.","My butthole hasn't been right for days, nor my stomach. \n\nWe ordered in because we all had a long day and were set to have a family movie night.\n\nA pizza and hoagie. \n\nThe hoagie wasn't anything to run and go scream from the rooftops about but the pizza was covered in little ass ruining intestinal demons and this I am nearly sure of.\n\nI had to be talked out of sending pizza Parma a bill for several rolls of toilet paper.\n\nBe weary of the pizza, distrustful actually.\n\nYour butthole will thank me for it!","Hubby and I dropped in after a hellish morning at the Social Security office. Hubby loves pizza so we made a stop.\n\nPizza wan't bad, it was actually pretty decent. But the place was disgusting and the cashier was incredibly rude.","I eat this pizza all the time when downtown, usually when running around at events like First Night or the Gallery Crawls...not the best pizza I have ever had in my life, but it's not bad!  And I haven't ever gotten sick from it.  Just wanted to offer a different opinion.","PIzza Parma's decent tasting mega-big-2ft-long hot sausage hoagie was let down by the piss poor attitude of the staff, the lack of cleanliness of the tables and floor, the out-of-order red door restroom, the bright yellow for no-explicable reason walls. \n\nThe large color-striped 80's retro tables and green chairs have come back in style but this win is purely accidental and achieved only by laziness and lack of renovation.\n\nThat is all.","My fiance & I have lived in downtown Pittsburgh for over a year + now & this place is fabulous. \nMy sweetie LOVES LOVES LOVESSS pizza & we order from here a ton.  We haven't ordered anything here that wasn't super tasty.\nThe shop is small & the decor is super bright which makes you want to get in & out quickly but who the hell eats in there anyways. ... you're grabbing your order & running.","I'm glad I listened to my friend's recommendation and not some of these bad reviews. We're just in town for the night and wanted something delivered to our hotel. They said it would take an hour, which I expected on Super Bowl Sunday right at game time, but it was here in less than half an hour. \n\nThe pizza was delicious! Just the right balance of cheese and a tasty sauce, generous with the toppings, and a nicely crispy crust but not too thin.","This place has great service! My best friend and I got 2 custom orders and the older guy in back came out to the register to take our orders personally.  I assume he's either the cook, owner, or both. We ordered 2 cheeselss pizzas; a lot of places mess this up. Pizza Parma however, makes great cheeseless pizza. Our personal pizzas were nice and toasty, not over nor undercooked, and it was not dried out at all! There was more than enough sauce mmmmmmmmm.","My fiance & I have lived in downtown Pittsburgh for over a year + now & this place is fabulous. \nMy sweetie LOVES LOVES LOVESSS pizza & we order from here a ton.

waiter was to be found about ten minutes later they gave us our water and left again! It wasn't even busy! There were only TWO dim sum carts floating around somewhere. Then our waiter finally came around and took our orders of lunch entrees. The food was not even that good as the reviews that are posted on here. When we came up to pay, the bill was super overpriced. I will not be returning here, I am better off eating at Great Wall Cuisine.","If this place had zero stars I would have given them that ! Let me start off by saying I was so excited to read all great reviews so maybe I just came in on a off day? We walked in and were seated came over and asked if we wanted water or tea I guess they don't serve anything Else, Then we placed an order pork dumplings and sticky rice nasty! Then I asked if they served egg rolls they said they were out!!! they pushed their little carts around with hot plates that basically steam the food and is not fresh and what you get is soggy poor customer service we had to get up and look for someone to give us our tab so we could get the heck out of there are get some real food. It looked like it would be a great place for groups of people would not recommend if you are on mission for what you want and want to place an order but it could be a fun experience for some people.","You walk into a Chinese restaurant on a Saturday afternoon for dim sum and you expect the place to be PACKED.  Well, walking in to a pretty much empty dining room, it's a VERY CLEAR SIGN.  But my friend insisted and I was very hesitant for good reasons.  Another indicator, the majority of the patrons were NON Asian.  \n\nFood: You walk in and you see carts of the food by the entrance to the dining room.  Umm, I thought dim sum should come right off the steamer and into the carts and they roll it around, not sitting around.  The dim sum was garbage.  It had the typical selection, but at minimum.  \n\nService: It's ok.  But it doesn't make up for the horrible food.\n\nBottom line: NO WAY!  Stay away!","I've been here many times...Mother's Day with family, dim sum with book club, etc. But I will not go back again.  I stopped in to ask the owner about a donation or reduced price for a class of under-privileged kids that I volunteer with.  His reaction was to scoff and shoo me out the door while handing me his card and saying I could email him.  He turned his back and headed off to the messy newspaper-strewn table he haunts between guests arrivals.  Maybe he's a community-minded business owner, but then again, maybe he's not.  I'll be dining elsewhere.","Being from Chicago, we are used to getting authentic Chinese food all the time.  But when we first starting spending a lot of time in Scottsdale/Phoenix, we found it a challenge to get authentic Chinese food.  We were excited to find the Golden Buddha and have made many trips over the years all the way from the Troon North area to get our fix.  However, service has declined to the point where it is no longer worth the aggravation.  We went there last night for Chinese New Year and will never go back.  Granted they were very busy because of a lot of large tables there, but waiting almost an hour to get our food is not acceptable under any circumstance!  45 mins. into our wait, the waitress came back (after we flagged her down to ask about our food) and said one of the dishes we ordered was not available....after 45 mins.!!!! What makes the whole experience an unforgivable one is that the manager/owner is so indifferent and never apologized or offered a discount off the bill...nothing.  When we left, the same manager was at the piano singing in Chinese. Huh?  Other than Nee House in Scottsdale, the search goes on for a restaurant that serves authentic Chinese food closer to home.","I will NEVER go there again.  I reserved a table for a group of 16 people for 5:00 PM on Christmas Eve .  The person on the phone ( I believe the manager) repeatedly asked me to call ahead and give him an accurate head count since he said they'd be swamped that day.  I followed up with him twice.  \nWhen the first couple of us arrived, we had menus shoved in our faces immediately and told we \"Must order now.  Must order now\" because they were going to be busy later on.  The place was practically empty.  As each person arrived, they were treated the same way. \nWe rushed and placed our orders and then they brought out our checks WAY before we saw any sign of our food.  I have never in my life been treated so rudely by a restaurant.\nIt was utter chaos when the food started coming out while everyone struggled to get the correct dish they ordered.  One person didn't get her food until we were all just about finished eating. \nOne top of all that, the food wasn't even good.  I've had better Kung Pao Chicken at Panda Express!\nAfter being rushed through our meal, the place wasn't even half full by the time we left.  I thought being at the Cultural Center, this restaurant would be a sure thing but boy was I wrong.  Lovely way to spend Christmas Eve..","If you are looking a chinese restaurant to host a big party look some other than the Golden Buddah.  I recently attended a banquet at the Golden Buddah and I was shocked at the level of quality of food and service.  Of the 10 dishes served 4 were nearly inedible.  \n\nThere was a crab claw appetizer, most chinese restaurants prepare this dish by taking a crab claw surrounding it with ground shrimp, batter and then deep fry.  At Golden Buddah, the crab claw served was mostly batter.  \n\nThe shark fin soup served was mostly broth.  Shark fin is an expensive ingredient and most places usually use imitation shark fin, but come on at least put something in there so that I know I'm eating soup and not dirty sink water.  \n\nGinger scallion lobster is battered, fried, and then stir fried in a sauce with ginger and scallions.  The ginger scallion lobster served was over-cooked and dried out.  \n\nLastly, there was a steamed fish.  The fish was raw in the middle.   \n\nIt wasn't all bad, there was a crispy chicken with garlic dish that was pretty good, but out of 10 dishes 4 were bad, 5 were okay, and 1 was good.  \n\nDoes 4 bad dishes out of 10 warrant a one star rating?  Well it does when you factor in the service.  The soup, appetizer, and first entree arrived timely, but after that there was a 1 hour gap before we received the next dish.  The dishes were not served with accompanying white rice which I thought was odd.  We had to ask for it, and even the rice took a while to arrive.","I agree with Crystal C., that the dim sum isn't the greatest I've ever had. In fact, I am not sure if the meal was so tasty that it was memorable. I do remember the \"calamari\" was not really calamari, like you would think. It was presented more like a sweet and sour pork (so calamari with LOTS of breading) without any sauce. As a result, the dish was dry and salty.\n\nThe sticky rice was good (hard to mess up), the chicken feet were okay (needed more five spice powder), and the shumai was alright. The noodles were good, and I can see why the cart ran out after the first round. The diners were an equal mix of Asians and Americans. I would've preferred to see more Asians eating (as I am used to in a Chinatown and gives an indication of authenticity), but I do realize we're in Phoenix where the Asian population is not like San Francisco or Houston. \n\nThe meal came to about $30 for two, including jasmine tea. The carts are loud because they are made out of metal and roll on tile. I am also not used to staff members shouting what they have in their cart, like a newspaper boy yelling \"Extra! Extra!\" Christmas music was playing after mid-January, so the atmosphere felt strange. Next time I visit the city, I probably will pass.","Can't say that I was very impressed. Came for dinner in a hopeful and enthusiastic mood since the reviews have been pretty good, but I don't think this place lives up to its current good, but declining rating.\n\nOrdered the Combo fried rice (shrimp, chicken, beef, pork), sesame chicken, and garlic fried chicken. \n\nThe combo fried rice was pretty good, but ended up drinking about 6 glasses of water due to the MSG and sodium content. You'd think that the cook spent his better years in the French Foreign Legion in the Sahara eating salt tablets and developed a taste for them. \n\nThe sesame chicken had a good flavor and a thick brown sweet sauce. I liked it a lot until it got cool and the sauce looked (with that stringy consistency) more like glue. You think I'm kidding? I'm not.\n\nGarlic fried chicken was bad. Just bad. It was like an over roasted dried out half chicken with some dried garlic pieces sprinkled on top. No spices, no flavor, no good. \n\nWe then got all kinds of lip from the waitress when we asked if they could change the channel on the TV from college football, to the Suns game. They made it into this big deal that the \"customers\" wanted to see the football game. Yeah right, it was University of West Virginia Vs. University of Connecticut! I would have believed it if it was a local team....\n\nIt's better than a 1 star joint, but only because it's borderline edible. To be avoided.","This restaurant is located in the Chinese Cultural Center and was the one restaurant that I had not been to. So after some shopping at one of the shops, we stepped in to have dinner.\n\nWe stepped in and asked for a seat for two. We were seated immediately. The place was decorated nicely and a lady playing the piano made for great ambiance.\n\nWe looked at the menu briefly and ordered our drinks, an appetizer, a soup and two main dishes. The drinks came out promptly and so did the rest of the meal. My goodness everything we ordered was very tasty.\n\nThe waiter service itself however was not even close to the decor and food. He never introduced himself, and although he took our order, our food itself was brought out by a kitchen person.\n\nAfter we ordered our waiter really never came back asking if we needed anything else, except to give us our check at the end and that was after the person I was dining with got up and asked a different waiter for it.\n\nIt's amazing how a place with great food, decor, and ambiance can mess it all up by crappy waiter service.","I love Dim Sum, my favorite Chinese dish.\n\nWhen Golden Buddha first open, they have excellent Dim sum. I went there many times, I tell my friend how good it is, But now,  they change cook, taste more like  week old left over. Rumor has it, they change cook every few month, so Quality of cooking change. (not sure if that is true, but that is what I was told.)\nMy advice is; when you walk in the door and the place is pack, = Good Cook. if the place is bare = bad cook. leave immediately. don't waste your money.","If you just \"want\" dim sum, go here. If you are \"craving\" dim sum, go elsewhere (take a 5 hour drive west to neighboring state, California).\n\nAnyway, I've been visiting Golden Buddha in the noontime for roughly 2 years now. I believe they moved from their original site (7th St. & Osborn), formerly \"China Doll.\" Relocation brought along better atmosphere and smiling faces. This does not mean, better dim sum. But since we are in Phoenix, I will settle for what they have to offer. \n\nBe mindful of the dim sum tab. It's itemized high-medium-low. \n\nShaomai can be found as combinations of pork/mushroom, shrimp, or shark fin (which should not be confused as true shark bits, as the shaomai is prepared to look like a shark's fin). These picks are okay...perhaps on a better day shao mai will be served in less-rigid, or fresher wrappers. Potstickers are okay as well, just the usual scallion and pork, and dry wrapper. The baby pork ribs in light black bean sauce and jalapenos is alright, but sometimes lacks in taste. Tripe is also served in its bare minimum...so if you enjoy the texture and flavor of tripe, try this with its clear sauce and thinly sliced carrots and celery.  \nBuche (that's what I call it), or fried sesame balls are also available, although if you wait until dessert, they will also be a bit stiff. There are a few other things that may be \"spotted\" but are not worth mentioning. \n\nDon't order from their lunch menu, as you can find these over-salted dishes at Panda Express anyway. \n\nOverall, dim sum at Golden Buddha is a place to go if you are around the vicinity and feel like having something apart from the usual fast food. However, discriminating palates- beware.","Not impressed with this place at all. This was not the friendliest place around, maybe because of the language barrier (most or all were clearly native Chinese speakers), or maybe just the attitude of the employees.\n\nI ordered the sweet and sour chicken lunch, which came with the typical egg drop soup, crab rangoon, and egg roll. The soup was ok - maybe it's just me, but I prefer a real spoon to the scoop that they gave me. The egg roll was tiny and not that great, and the crab rangoon was ok, but maybe a little undercooked. The chicken wasn't bad, but nothing special, as was the rice and other stuff on the plate.\n\nOverall, this was just not my kind of Chinese place.","Disappointing.  Mediocre at best.  I am staying at the Aloft hotel in phoenix and ordered some delivery. I ordered a couple american chinese food staples: general tso's chicken, dumplings and hot&sour soup.  Soup had zero flavor, dumplings tasted freezer burned and processed.  General tso chicken was ehh. \n\nA lot of good reviews on here so it must be for eat in and for their dim sum.  Don't order delivery, you will be left hungry and unsatisfied.","Went there on Saturday for early lunch.  My wife did the dim sum, it was okay, we were both disgusted by the sugar cane shrimp; but the rest was good.  \n\nI ordered the chicken szechwuan, the waitress warned me it was \"spicy\" the reason I ordered it.  It came out delicious, but not what I would call spicy.  Overall its hard to find good Chinese in the valley and I would call this good without hesitation.","So I was referred to this place from the front desk of my hotel. I'm from SF so I'm coming from a place with really good chinese food. \n\nThe dim sum is just \"ok\" nothing for me to write home about. The one dish that I really liked was the chinese broccoli cooked with garlic sauce. Yum yum yum.  It's in a big bowl, not oily, not saucy, just really good. I think it's $7.50.  \n\nIt's a somewhat pricey and just like all chinese restaurants, it's not the cleanest.  The chair was filthy.  the dishes weren't all that great.  I wouldn't go back unless I want the chinese broccoli.  \n\nSo I went on a Sunday and it was not crowded at all. There's not a huge asian population  in Phoenix (not that I could tell) so I don't think there's a high demand for dim sum.  And also, I sooooooo felt like taking a pic of this, but a Mexican lady was pushing one of the dim sum carts. That is unheard of in SF.  This is a mainly mandarin restaurant and the dim sum places I go are usually cantonese.  Not a big deal though since the dishes look the same. \n\nDude, there was a turtle in the fish tank that I saw as I left.  I hope they don't eat that!","A Premier Chinese Atmosphere,\nThe Chinese cultural center and Asian Garden produces an Asain atmosphere that can be recognized from the 202.  \n With Dim Sum served this location earns its respect from the local community.\n\nDim Sum tip,  You have to be smart with the Dim Sum ladies they look nice innocent but they are professional sales people that will sell you more dishes than you need before you know what to do.  \n\nI love the desserts here ask the server to see the dessert tray.","This restaurant has a bit of an identity crisis. It is in the Chinese cultural center, but serves Japanese beer (Kirin on tap!) and the live piano music is American pop. We had to ask for chopsticks.\n\nHaving said that, the service was professional. Our waiter held a hot appetizer for one of our party who was away from the table so that it would not be cold when he returned. We were asked frequently--and not too frequently--if things were ok both by our waiter and the manager/proprietor.\n\nThe food was ok-to-good. Fried shrimp egg rolls were dainty but yummy. Duck was tasty but very chewy. Kung-pao chicken was pleasantly spiced. Plenty of rice. A pitcher of ice water with lemon was left at the table. \n\nAtmosphere was also pleasant. Chairs comfortable, tables spaced well, restrooms large and clean...and there is indeed a large golden Buddha by the entrance.","I took a group of friends here and relatives other times. The place is consistently good for Dim-sum during lunch. It is typical Chinese and nothing fancy.\n\nWhat helps this place is the moat scenery.  3 stars for visiting here based on convenience since there are similar places in town.","Having grown up in Hong Kong and having eaten dim sum in London, NY, LA, SF and Vancouver (actually Richmond), I can confidently say I know my dim sum.\n\nGood selection of well-executed dim sum when the carts actually come around and there's anything left in it.  I'd give it 4 stars for food but the wait definitely detracted from the whole experience.\n\nI think the problem with Golden Buddha is that they can't handle the heavy flow on weekends.  There's not enough regular dim sum eaters like LA that can sustain a steady flow of diners throughout the week, forcing restaurants like Golden Buddha to depend heavily on extra part-time help on weekends.  \n\nDim sum takes serious skill so the chef still ends up doing most of the work.  When we looked into the kitchen, we saw a Chinese woman doing most of the cooking herself.  No wonder it took forever for a cart to come out and when it does, it's swarmed on by a pack of vultures.\n\nIf you're willing to eat at a more simply decorated place with a smaller menu, I'd highly recommend China Chan.  It's much more relaxed - usually no wait on weekends.  An experienced chef makes all the dim sum himself so the menu's much shorter but all the classics are on it.  Anything steamed is made to order so is very fresh.","Situated in the Chinese Cultural Center near the SkyHarbor Airport, this was another pleasant find. All I had was the Dim Sum menu, and I would say this is the best you're gonna get in Phoenix. Still worth the stop to get your Dim Sum fix. The cart ladies were pleasant and very happy to converse with me in Cantonese. Only downside was the chicken sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaves, naw mei gai, was way overcooked, and mushy.","Do you want to eat Chinese Food in an elegant environment on a Friday night in Phoenix? \n\nBe entertained by classic, quiet standards being played live on a piano while you dine?\n\nAre you 50 years old and Caucasian?\n\nThen the Golden Buddha is the place for you! \n\nIts in the Chinese Cultural Center Mall on 44th, and a popular weekend spot for Dim Sum. For a DIm Sum starved Valley of the Sun, Golden Buddha's is decent. \n\nFor dinner, though, it is awfully Americanized and not very authentic Chinese. But with a bunch of American customers coming for dinner, what do you expect? They probably think they are getting \"real Chinese\" food by going to the Chinese Mall, but then again, they are used to PF Chang's or Stix normally in their neighborhood, so this is a step up.\n\nThe best thing about this place is the decor, which is clean and nice, with a Hong Kong Junk boat design covering the ceiling from the bar into the dining room. The next best thing is the Piano interludes on weekend nights. The service is next, which is a little overly eager to remove your plate, and the last thing is the food. \n\nThey do give decent portions. I ordered Guo Teh (potstickers) and got 6 fat ones. But they weren't served with the usual soy, chili oil and vinegar, but a soy and green onions mixture. The Mapo Tofu was ok, as they used a nice silky tofu, which was nice, but no green onions, and sliced black mushrooms instead, which I like, but not in this dish.\n\nCome here for the ambiance and music in the evenings, or on the weekend days for Dim Sum.","Decent dim sum, especially to be found in the middle of the desert. Sadly, the best food I've had in Phoenix.","This place is a little difficult for me to review.  I was staying at the Hampton Inn across the street and this is the closest restaurant so off I went.\n\nI walked in and the owner or manager met me at the door and asked \"how many\"?\n\nI told him I wanted to order take out and handed me a menu and pointed to the waiting area which was covered in newspapers.  I chose to go to the bar, order a glass of wine, and peruse the menu.\n\nThe drinks are expensive but I didn't think the food was.  Less than $10 for my Mongolian Chicken which came with white sticky rice and a fortune cookie.  When ordering I asked if I could have fried rice instead of white rice but was told \"no\".  Most places allow this for a nominal fee.\n\nFine by me.  Give the white rice.  Food was prepared and their to-go boxes were a lot better than the standard white Chinese \"to go\" boxes.  They also included the plastic-ware, napkin, and soy sauce, which a lot of places forget.\n\nLooking around I found a whole lot of goodness along with a couple disappointments.  Most notably the newspaper strewn about and behind the bar, to the right were a lot of boxes stacked in an unsightly fashion.  I could have been a little more presentable in my opinion.\n\nI peeked into the dining room because I wanted to see if the piano music was piped in or live.  It was live which was very nice. Also, the dinning room looked very nice and cozy.\n\nAs I was leaving the same man who greeted me upon entering made sure to wish me a good evening.  My initial impression of the man was that he was surly and testy but that's just how he comes off.\n\nThe food was very good.  The Mongolian sauce was mixture of sweet with spice and the chicken and vegetables all tasted fresh.","My husband and I went there Saturday, the service was great!  Our friends were going to be late so they told us to start.  And start we did!\nThey were serving Dim Sum, something we had never tried, so glad we did, it was wonderful, hubby wouldn't do the chicken feet, but I think next time I will, it looked very good.\nOur friends showed up and ordered their food, and ate all of it, they said that usually they take food home, but it was so good they had to eat all of it!\nWe will be going back very soon!","Let's see, over 50... check \nold white man...........check \neats dinner ...............check \nlistens to the piano  check \n\nwow this must be the place for me, I mean after all it is in a Chinese mall, no make that a Chinese Cultural Center. How could I possibly have discerning taste with such trickery to get me here to eat. \nDude if you are going to rate a restaurant no need to degrade others with your arrogance. \nFool is my review of wanugee N. \n\nNow on the restaurant. The last time we were here the food was not good, the piano was too loud and the waitress had a real attitude. IT won't keep me from going back as I have had good meals and wait service too. \n\nBack to wanugee N. I do not expect any place in Phx. to have authentic Chinese food, by that I mean the street food one finds in China. \nBut I do expect what I fork in to my mouth is worth what I am going to fork over in cost. Even an old white guy like me can tell the difference between good and bad food. No matter what it is called.","Okay so Ive been glum the past few days as I have an impending birthday. Every year this time I get all down in the dumps.. not that I'm not happy with my life cause life is good. Its more like getting further away from my youth and closer to being well, old. All of my grandparents were crotchety, sourpuss drama queens.. is that my fate? Can I break the mold or am I to going to be a crotchety sourpuss?\n\nSo as I contemplate and figure out what I'm going to do with my birthday baggage I decide to squash it with food. All weekend Ive been eating out and having a good time. This is one of the few times outside of a vacation where I will live it completely and to the near of sheer gluttony. So why not dim sum? \n\nIve chowed much dim sum in my 36 years of earthen wear.. of course some good and some bad. I have never been to a place where every dish was great.. Golden Buddha is no exception to this.. they do the basics well enough and have enough funky cool Asian style to keep me interested in returning. The carts around 1130 flow well but around noon it' s full blown freeway action! In fact there might be some road kill in there based on some of the looks on that last steam cart.. \n\nMe and 3 others who were feeling my pain ordered 14, count them, 14 different dishes. One of my friends is from Georgia and had never had dim sum but he is so courageous and unflinching that he was just a blast. Just the shot in the arm to get me out of my funk. I remember the first time I had dim sum.. my eyes wide open, nostrils flared and excited to see what was under the next steamer lid. That was him today.. one exciting thing after the next.. he was even willing to try chicken feet but this is one of those dishes not done very well here. \n\nMy friend took me back to a time where I was younger and less experienced. He looked up to me to guide him through the noodles, bao and sui mai.. like a big brother.. I'm privileged that I could show him something new and exciting and he was so into it! So instead of feeling sorry for myself I felt experienced and useful.. that there is something I can give back to others.. that its not all about me and me aging but about what can be shared with others.\n\nThere is so much more to do, give and feel in this short time we are here.. and Ill do it to, one bite at a time.","The best to be found in land locked Arizona.  My favorite sticky rice is here.  They have dim sum every day, but not a huge selection, though you can order off the menu.  I think it is much bigger on the weekends.  I'm just happy I can get my fix 7 days a week.  Beautiful gardens to walk through, with fish ponds, and a 99 market next door!","I ate at Golden Buddha a few weeks ago.  We ate at the restaurant after a day at the zoo with our 4 year old and had a blast.  The piano bar played tunes for my daughter and the staff was more than accommodating.  The general tso chicken was better than anything I can get in Tucson.  The soup was chocked full of fresh, read FRESH, not canned, vegetables.  All in all, I was very satisfied with the meal and the service.  Plus the decor is very nice, clean and cheery. \n\nEat at Golden Buddha.","For those who gave this place low marks, forgive me. I really like this place. Now I haven't tried various dim sum places so I'm reserving the right to downgrade the place as needed. The variety of food is plentiful, and the carts just keep on coming. I love the steamed pork buns, and the shiu mai (not sure if I spelled that correctly). Yesterday, my favorite pick was the deep fried rolls of taro and shrimp. YUM! I have never ordered from their menu so I can only talk about their dim sum. My friends and I try to go eat dim sum almost every Sunday. It's a cheap way to try new foods, and if you don't like it, well.. you can get away with pushing it aside with minimal guilt. Give it a try! You might be surprised.","I like Golden Buddha, have taken many friends there for Dim Sum.  \nTry not to \"hit\" the dumpling cart to heavy; otherwise cannot finish it to the dessert cart (LOL).\nLove the jasmine tea and the staff willing to help you if you do not understand the what each item is.\nSingapore Rice Noodles a favorite, along with any of the shrimp dumplings; also the broccoli and green beans.\nOnly wish that the carts with eggplant stuffed with shrimp or green peppers with shrimp were not on \"heated\" carts; by the time it gets to you the food is cold.\nOnly concern is that went on 22MAY2010 at 1:30PM; there was a closed sign due to electricity???\nREVISED: 26MAY2010 - called this evening - looks like they are back open again.","I've been to the Golden Buddha on several occasions and it is my favorite, by far, for honest Chinese food. \nWhile I've sampled everything from their vegetarian to their beef, I love their mandarin chicken. More recently, I was delighted to relive the wonders of their Kung Pao Chicken and Beef with Broccoli. \nI absolutely love the egg drop soup and mini crab rangoons that come with the meal.","The very first time I went to Golden Buddha was with my BFF and it was our first dim sum experience. Little did I know this would forever change my life and eating experiences. Although I must admit that first time was a bit awkward.\n\nGB wisely takes reservations which was wonderful (even though it wasn't crazy busy). Our assorted dim sum plates were flavorful and fresh. And the carts seemed to be in constant rotation so we were never too far from a good selection.\n\nWhat really helps GB is its location. The Cofco Center is an experience in itself, where one can have herbs specially blended, select a fresh member of marine life to take home and cook or browse through a store with one of the largest selections of Buddhas and hand fans I've experienced outside of San Francisco.","I've been to Golden Buddha a few times and have not been disappointed. \n\nThey have a LARGE selection of Dim Sum and if you're not careful you can get carried away.\n\nTry and get there early and you'll get the best and most fresh selection.\nMake sure you walk around the garden when you're done.","Probably the most comprehensive Chinese menu in the Valley.  Pick from well over 100 dishes, but if you want the best order the Peking Duck.  Everything else is very good, but without a wow factor.  You'll see lots of Chinese people in this massive restaurant, which probably means they're doing a fine job in the kitchen.","I very much enjoyed eating here. Food was great. Fairly fast service. Wasn't expensive either for the 4 of us.","Golden Buddha has GREAT dim sum.  Their prices are reasonable and the staff is very polite wheeling their little carts.  I tend to go on the weekend because there is more selection but they do dim sum throughout the week.  They also have some very authentic dishes on the menu for those who are more of the adventurous types.  Be sure to say hello to the turtles the next time you go.","This place in the Chinese Cultural Center has a very pretty and elegant bar area. I was pleased to learn that they had some very reasonable and delicious happy hour snacks. This is a good place for a Pina Colada. I had one by myself along with some dumplings and fried shrimp appetizer. Sadly I never brought anyone else here with me. It was happy hour heaven but you know? A lot of my friends in AZ pretty much hang out in one neighborhood or another and nobody I know really lives close to the Buddha.\nThe airport is pretty close by. This might be a good pre-flight send-off location.","I have had dim sum in New Orleans and Phoenix (not SF), and this is about equal to the best of New Orleans as far as flavor.\nAs for ambiance, today was a good day. I've had dim sum here about a dozen times, and have had very good service and quality 90% of the time, including weekends. I have had bad days here, but since today was good, I'll rate accordingly. It's closer to a 4.5, but since I can't give half-stars, I rounded up.\nDon't expect me to give these the right names, but... I was less than impressed with the bbq pork balls. They tasted too much like honey and the beef was minimal. The bbq sauce tasted bottled. Outside of that, their herbal hot tea is delicious even on a hot day.\nThe shu mai were very good, and the shrimp in a spinach dumpling was fantastic. A definite don't miss is their sticky rice in lotus leaf. It's among the best I've had anywhere. Just be careful; you'll find bones in it every once in a while. Go for any of their steamed dumplings; they're very flavorful. As others have said, I love the Chinese broccoli, but you'll only find it on the carts on weekends. Otherwise order it off the menu.\nToday (11:30 lunch) the carts came around often, and everything except the pork buns was piping hot and fresh. By the way, despite the price increases, even the sticky rice was considered a medium size entree, and the two of us eating there escaped with a bill under $20 and we were done in under 30 minutes.\nI strongly recommend the dim sum here, whether you've had it a million times or have never had it before. You usually won't be disappointed.","I don't really understand the poor reviews on this place.....maybe it depends on the day you go? We went on a Sunday, it was crazy busy, but service was great! (of course, my view of customer service is a little different then the rest... I used to live on an island where you were just happy to find what you were looking for, let alone expect good customer service) Anyways, our server was very sweet! Always had a smile on her face. The carts served us promplty and none of the food was cold. They always had whatever we wanted (I hate having to wait for the next cart).\n\nNow, as for the actual dim sum and food.......holy cow, to die for! So flavorful and fresh!! The broccoli makes you sing...and the wine noodles, make you cry. You leave with very weird mixed emotions, but mostly a happy belly full of yummy food.\n\nIn my opinion, this is the best dim sum I have been able to find in Phx. I'm ditching my previous spot (Mekong Palace) and will be back to Golden Buddha when the dim sum monster strikes again!"],"type":["Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low

Goulash in the Contrucci household was made of elbow noodles, beef and spaghetti sauce.  I guess you can't believe everything your parents tell you right?  \n\nSo going in here, I was thinking, great...mom's goulash!  What was set in front me looked NOTHING like what I was used to.  It was a mish mosh of veggies,noodles, gravy and some random unidentifiable food items.  I usually eat whatever is put in front of me, so I wasn't scared to dive it.  Sadly, I just didn't like it.  I thought it was actually not very appetizing at all.  I know, I know, this is like \"world famous\" goulash, but I was NOT into it!  \n\nWhat I was into was the German Potato Salad.  I love it, and honestly, I feel like I never get the same version of it anywhere in the Burgh.  This was a no frills version, with scallop sliced potatoes and a thick vinegar sauce.  Maybe a bit too much, but not enough for me to eat it all!  \n\nWould I go back? If someone else really wanted to go there, but I wouldn't suggest it nor would I go on my own.  Oh well, on to the next one right?","This used to be the best German food in town. I have seen a gradual decline in the food over the past several years. The gravies have changed and the Max's Goulash (one of my favorite dishes) has a different sauce (strangely dessert sweet) and change in the protein. The sides are still great, but the food used to be so much better.","The goulash was (sickeningly) sweet and the bread pudding wasn't sweet at all.  But the atmosphere is kind of cool.  And the prices are downright cheap.","After hearing Hofbrauhaus-haters say that Max's Allegheny Tavern is the only place to go in Pittsburgh for German food, my husband and I decided to finally try the restaurant this afternoon.\n\nWe were seated in little booths right next to the bar. They were cozy, but the seats reminded me of old fashioned church pews. Our waitress soon brought us a little basket of four rolls with butter, sauerkraut relish, and apple butter. Though I liked the different varieties of bread, it was nothing special. The relish and apple butter were a nice touch though.\n\nOur waitress was busy with both waiting tables and tending the bar, but she managed to check on us pretty frequently. Our food also came out relatively promptly. I order the Wiener Schnitzel with Potato Pancakes and Spatzle on the side. The Wiener Schnitzel was amazing -- by far the best I've ever had! The veal was tender and the fried surface was perfectly crispy. However, the sides sadly did not match this main dish. The Potato Pancakes were oddly bitter, and I did not enjoy them with either the sour cream or applesauce. I only ate two or three bites and completely stopped eating them. (I must add that Hofbrauhaus's potato pancakes are delicious and something that I order every time that I go there.) I also did not enjoy the Spatzle, but I am accustomed to eating cheese Spatzle.... So I may be reviewing this harshly since I'm just not used to plain Spatzle, but in my opinion, it was terribly bland and watery.\n\nOverall, Max's Allegheny Tavern served one incredible item (Wiener Schnitzel), but everything else was merely mediocre. Because of this, I really don't plan on returning to the restaurant again any time soon. I'll be sticking with the fun environment and overall good food at Hofbrauhaus, actually.","I really thought I'd never be back.  The goulash I had was so so gross.  But then,  was roped in by some friends who were doing a Sunday brunch book club.  Of course I couldn't miss out on tantalizing conversation... so I obliged.  \n\nI really had no clue what they offered for brunch options, but quickly learned they have a a pretty decent size brunch buffet.  I'm not below buffets at all, it's the fat kid in me!  Most things still looked a little questionable to me, but I went for the big ticket items.  Make your own omelets, potato pancakes and dessert.  I'd hit up the buffet again, but still be hasty to check out the regular menu again.  \n\nThe omelet was made right in front of you, so I added cheese, mushrooms, peppers, tomatoes and onions.  I was super excited about it because it was the size of a football.  Sadly, it was pretty tasteless.  I don't think they added any salt or pepper to the egg mix, so it came out really bland, despite loading up on ingredients.  \n\nBut the potato pancakes... I could survive on them forever.  They were amazeballs!  Add some sour cream and I was in potato patch heaven!  I had to keep myself from getting more because of the other thing I loaded up on... dessert.  \n\nThe desserts looked unassuming, but they were also awesome.  I had a smattering of delectable bites.  The scones were so moist and tasty.  I had to stop myself from taking more than 20.  I also had some carrot cake, brownies, cookies among other things I inhaled and didn't pay attention too.  Should I be embarrassed?  Probably.  But I don't care because it was darn good!","I took my boyfriend, a German-food enthusiast, to Max's Allegheny Tavern last night. We had been looking forward to a night out together for a while. \n\nI think the food was good, but it's hard to say, because all I could focus on was the LOUD -- and I mean LOUD -- woman seated behind my boyfriend and me.\n\nHer profanity-laden discussion with her dining partners was so bad that for the first time in my life, I turned around and asked a fellow restaurant patron to take the volume down a few notches. \n\nThe restaurant was almost empty; I have no idea why the host chose to seat a loud party of five next to a couple having a quiet dinner.","FYI: New happy hour specials are awful. Just awful. Sorry guys, as much as i love you   I've got to put my food down somewhere. Even raising the prices on all of the apps to 3.99 would've been better than taking the pierogie (aka potato pockets) special off all together. \n\nWon't be back.","I've been here once because this was an easy place to meet for dinner with a friend. I enjoyed eating here well enough.\n\nI'm honestly not a die-hard fan of German food, although I guess that wouldn't have mattered: a peak at the menu beforehand revealed that this place's menu is mostly Americanized - proof of this is the fact that my salad was topped with French fries (only in Pittsburgh...). Trust me, even if you don't really like German food, there'll at least be a sandwich you'll like here.\n\nThinking about my usual \"overall\" summary, I have to say this place wasn't bad and served as a reasonable place to meet - the beer menu looked nice from what I saw and the atmosphere was pretty cozy and even nostalgic and homely - but man, the dining options really weren't that extraordinary. I'm still torn as to how to feel about its menu, because on the one hand obviously it being Americanized meant even I could find something to enjoy, but on the other I feel bad for the people who do like German food and may not be getting what they hope for. \n\nIt wasn't bad enough that I'd say don't try it and see - just understand it may not be exactly what you expect.","Authentic German fare. German beer. Best soft pretzels in Pittsburgh. Reasonable prices. Friendly service. Very fair portion sizes. You'll be taking a box home. The basement is nice. But sometimes used for private events. Has a very cozy \"grotto\" feel to it.","Want a taste of the old ethnic communities of Pittsburgh? Go to Max's Allegheny Tavern. German never tasted sooo nice!\n\nMenu Fav: Potato Pancake Reuben. Forget the bread and wrap your lips around sweet potato pancakes and loads of corned beef. Try the hot potato salad too.","This place is great for brunch on Sunday! The service is great and the food is delicious. I always leave stuffed and happy.","I have a friend that loves this place, and I have been told it's the best German food in Pittsburgh so I had to give it a try.\n\nI had the Roasted Loin of Pork Stubenkuchen Style with German Style Potato Salad, and Sauerkraut. Everything was really good. The Pork was delicious and that mushroom gravy that they put on it was nothing short of amazing. I want a whole bucket of the stuff to put on everything. The Sauerkraut was interesting featuring shredded pork mixed in. The german potato salad was good but was pretty much what I expected. \n\nTheir draft  beer Selection left a little bit to be desired but featured 5-8 beers many of them popular german style beers. \n\nI got a good idea what this place is all about and I have to say that I will be back for more.","I ordered the Roast Pork loin with Apple raisin dressing, sauerkraut, and German potatoes. Oh yeah... Right Choice! Took a little longer than usual as there was a Large Party of 16 that ordered Just prior to us. Happy to say the waitress took Great care of us, plenty of rolls, drink refills, etc. as we waited. Apple Strudel for the Final Act. So Good, I forgot to take a picture. lol","Diane is awesome, i used to live in PA and\nmoved to CA and this is a great place for a beer,\ncheap food and good friends.\nI miss this place.\nOne of my favorites places back home in PA!","I've been going to Max's off and on for 31 years (I KNOW!  How could someone as young as I am been going there for THAT long?)    And I am not from nor ever lived in the North Side!\n\nThat said...i have always loved the food and the place.   I was great the first time and was great last night!   Most of the mains can be recommended without reservation....last night I had roasted pork with dressing and gravy.  It was deliscious!    As for sides....I ALWAYS have potato pancakes and sweet and sour cabbage.  (Because of my eastern european background I am partial to both cabbage and potatoes.   Do not be afraid of the cabbage unless you dislike sour! \n\nWe didn't have dessert, but did have beer and drinks.   They have a nice selection.\n\nMy only complaint was that the food was slow to come out.   It was a busy Friday night and I wasn't going anywhere so I had anover beer.   No big problem.\n\nGive Max's a try.....it might make your favorite like it did mine!","I have a confession to make........the thing I like most about Max's is their bread!!! They are free....they are fresh made....hot and soft...different kinds....and so so delicious!\nI'm not a big fan of German food, but it's just my personal taste. The portions are large and atmosphere is very relaxing and casual. I like it.","Our first stop in Pittsburgh, what a great start! Had a couple of yuenglings, a warm, salty yummy soft pretzel and a big ole plate of German goodness in da tummy!\n\nThe Peasant Platter had knock wurst, weisswurst and a pork chop on top of heap of sauerkraut...with potato pancakes, spaetzel and a basket of baked breads!  So.much.food.  And oh soooo good!\n\nThe bar is cool, staff is really nice and I believe they offer their patrons a free ride to and from on game days!","We (my fiance and I) went out for a pseudo-couples' date with our good friends, Sara and Thom, to Max's to introduce them to some of the most authentic German food in da Burgh. Where most people associate Hofbrauhaus with the ultimate German beer-hall experience, I prefer Max's for the quieter, less raucous environs. (At least when it's not Oktoberfest)\n\nWe'd been there once before and immediately fell in love with the place. I (still) keep raving about the Sausage and Cheese platter. They've got some good Gouda. The Potato Pockets (pierogies) were OK -- I'd take some Pierogies Plus or Forgotten Taste over Max's, but that's just me.\n\nThe spaetzel was to die for, however. It's like a German Mac n' Cheese. And boy, do I love me some Mac n' Cheese. It literally melts in your mouth with its' ooey-gooey-ness.\n\nDrink-wise, I tried their German lager and Thom tried the sampler. Thom is a beer enthusiast. For around eight bucks, you get a GOOD amount of beers to try -- they are not some dinky little shot glass samples, either. Thom had some trouble near the end finishing it...it was so much beer. Bob had a Captain and ginger-ale...in a king-size goblet. Goblets are the ONLY way to serve adult bevvies.\n\nFor dinner, I had the pork loin over an apple-raisin gravy/bread concoction. The pork loin was flavorful and tender, and quite delicious. Sara had the sauerbraten and seemed to enjoy it. Bob's burger was ginormous and looked extra tasty.\n\nWe finished it off with the Apple Fritters. Now, these fritters aren't for the faint of heart. And they aren't your average dinky small sized portions, either. You get two huge deep fried apple fritters, covered in vanilla ice cream. One person CANNOT eat the whole serving. You must, I repeat MUST share them. If you attempt to eat the whole plate yourself, you will have flavor explosion, followed by severe heartburn. But damn, are they GOOD.\n\nOur visit ended up totaling 2 hours. One thing, though...please fix your outdoor sign. Usually it shines out like a red and blue beacon in the night for people to find their way there, but on Wednesday, it was out. Driving there, I got confused on where it exactly was (but I had a general idea, as I had been there before.).","Max's is my parents' favorite restaurant when they're in town visiting me. Good, solid food with a great deal of [German] variety. I love the German beer flights (i.e., beer sampler) and the atmosphere is funny - a bit like your grandmother's parlor. The bread that comes with entrees is delicious (pumperknickel + others), and their cherry sauer kraut is delicious as well.\n\nThe food is good, but you must be careful with certain dishes. One of the schnitzels that comes with carrots/peas is clearly bedecked in carrots & peas that were recently frozen. German food isn't exactly known for its vegetables, so I let it slide but I always remember not to order that dish when I'm there.","I have been coming to Max Allegheny Tavern since I was still in my mother's womb.  But seriously.  This place has been an institution for my family, and I really love it here.  I feel like this is some of the only German food in Pittsburgh, and I think it represents fairly well.  My thoughts:\n\nBrunch Buffet- I love the Sunday brunch buffet more than life.  Omelette station, German and American breakfast and lunch foods, and lots and lots of beautiful, delicious, and decadent desserts.  It's heaven on Earth.  There is usually a decent selection of meats, and the potato pancakes are almost always featured.  They've changed it a bit over the years, but I still love this buffet.\n\nAppetizers- My family loves the soft pretzels.  They are so yummy and buttery, but a bit heavy if you are going to eat your entire meal.  So make sure to share.\n\nMeals-  I, personally, have never had a bad meal here.  The sauasages of all varieties have been great.  The weinerschnitzel also great.  Sandwiches all good as well.  I really like the cheesy spaetzle dish that is just like macaroni and cheese but with spaetzle noodles!  I don't get too crazy and order anything complicated, though.\n\nSides-  I love love love their sides.  I could live on the spaetzle and potato pancakes.  Don't pass the sides up!\n\nDessert:  Also love their desserts.  There is a chocolate chocolate cake that they heat up with homemade whipped cream that is TO DIE FOR.  Not so shockingly, the apple strudel is wonderful as well.\n\nBesides the food, the servers are always very friendly and efficient.  There is also ample street parking, which is really nice.  Definitley check this place out if you have not yet.","How can there be no reviews of Max's Allegheny? This north side German food institution in Pittsburgh has been around for years and years and has menus that tell you so. They also tell you the story of the north side of Pittsburgh, which I also found interesting. The place itself has a lot of character and looks like it's seen a lot of years there. It's a little weathered, but definitely homey and sturdy.\n\nRandy S. and I headed there post Tazza D'Oro on a Sunday for brunch. It happened to be the same very Sunday the Pens were playing the Flyers in game 7, so all the waitresses were wearing Pens paraphernalia, which definitely added to the experience. On Sunday morning it has a brunch buffet with all the standards, plus a healthy dose of Germanic add ons like German farmers breakfast (eggs, sausage and gravy-ed potatoes), red cabbage, pork chops, sauerkraut and potato pancakes. \n\nThe brunch buffet is in a room with a giant tapestry of Neuschwanstein behind the guys at the omelet bar. If that's not rad, I don't know what is. We told the waitress we were going in, went and got back and sat down to find our two ice teas on the table in mason jars (always dope). \n\nThe food was just what you would expect in Pittsburgh: gut busting. It wasn't artisinal or fancy, healthy or particularly remarkable, but it was pretty fonking good and to eat that food in that restaurant really made me feel like I was in Pittsburgh. I can imagine all the food there would be of the 'hot and brown' category, in a positive way. And the waitress was probably the nicest on our drive from Dallas to CT. \n\nA really fun place, if showing it's age (though remorselessly).","Real german food (sausage, etc) and decent beer in family friendly atmosphere.\n\nThis is one of the good joints.","Max's is a great place for German food.  I've had several sandwiches, most of the appetizers and even the Sunday brunch (which has a good spread but can be hit or miss) -  though not all in one visit.\n\nI most recently took my Mom out for dinner using a Living Social deal I had.  Somehow, even though we have both been to Max's quite a few times before neither of us had ever seen the sampler platter option on their menu.  For just a bit more than the cost of the regular entrees, you can choose three entrees and two sides.  Obviously the portions of each selection are smaller than the individual meals, but the size is still generous and there were only a couple things not available for the sampler platter.  Between the two of us we selected six different items and four different sides to try and shared everything - and still had enough left for a full meal each the next day.  I can't even decide on my favorite of all the items we tried.  If you aren't sure about some of the entrees, this is a great way to see what you like.  I personally loved everything so much that I think my new go-to menu item from now on will be the sampler platter.  Not being forced to choose just one item is what living in America is all about.\n\nAll together I think our bill was around $35 (no alcoholic beverages consumed).  Some might consider this a tad pricey but the food is so good I usually don't mind the slightly higher cost.  Service has never been a problem for me in fact they've always been helpful when I have questions about the menu.  Full bar with numerous good beers on tap.  If you want German food in Pittsburgh, Max's is definitely the place to start.","Quaint spot on a back street in the North Side.  Very polite service, and delicious food at a great value.  Will definitely go back for authentic German fare.","One of my favorite north side haunts. Great to take visitors who need to understand what it means to be German in Pittsburgh. \n\nGet the soft pretzels. Get anything that comes with a potato pancake. Get the kielbasa. Get it all. You can't go wrong. \n\nOh, and the spaetzle. The spaetzle.......","Max's is one of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh.  It's the Kennywood Thunderbolt of Pittsburgh restaurants.  The Thunderbolt is considered one of the best rollercoasters in the country.  It's not the fastest, it's old, it doesn't have the biggest drops or flip you upside-down.  And yet it's great.  It's classic.  This is Max's Allegheny Tavern.  I'm sure there's better German food with cuter waitresses somewhere out there that doesn't have the decor aesthetics of your grandma's living room.  But who cares.  This place is just right.\n\nFinal note, I can't speak for the brunch buffet.  I went in there for the buffet once and decided that my money would be better spent on the menu.","This is my favorite restaurant on the Northside, possibly favorite restaurant in all of Pittsburgh.  I tell all my friends that this little restaurant is the best kept secret in Pittsburgh.  Max's is a quaint little German place that always has plenty of seating, even on Friday and Saturday nights.  The service is good.  The food is great, I always end up getting the potato pancakes.  If you are looking for a place to check out that isn't going to be as crowded and will be more \"authentic\" German food than other places you should definitely come to Max's!","German food and German beer served in a mason jar. Best in Pittsburgh. The history of the tavern and the friendly makes this wish me that I lived closer to Max's.","Tremendous selection of German dishes.  All the sausages come from a particular manufacturer in Wisconsin that uses 100 year old methods of making them (according to the menu).  I don't know if that's a good thing or not, but they taste terrific.  \n\nThe options for sides are as plentiful as the moan dishes and the hot bacon potato salad was awesome.  \n\nDefinitely recommend giving this a try.","Crap!  I can't believe that I missed a \"First to Review\" by just a matter of weeks.  Max's Allegheny Tavern has been a shining star and a \"must\" for my Pittsburgh rotation of places to visit.  Years ago, when I worked on the Northside for Heinz, I spent many a rowdy Friday night here in the basement with factory workers.  \n\nWhat's there to say?  It's a Northside institution and always has a mixed crowd that is super cool and friendly.  The bartenders are friendly and manage to remember my name and drink choice even though I'm here only a few times a year.  My Friday nights here must have made quite an impression!  I love the decor here, dark wood paneling with lots of stained glass, and the downstairs bar is where the naughty people hang.  Jukebox and room for dancing.  The food is very homey and very reasonably priced.  The German nachos are always worth ordering, and they are smothered with Gouda cheese.  The spatzle is also a creamy indulgent treat.  And for those seeking the real Deutsch culinary experience, they have a large variety of sausages and schnitzels.  So it's a sausage factory in more ways than one.","5 stars because I accept it for what it is.  Really good German comfort  food with killer drafts.  And the fact that the place has been there for forever makes it super cool.  I love the player piano and put a quarter in every time!  PS. the popcorn at the bar is sooooooooo good too.","Been coming to Max's for years. Very consistent. \n\nFood is always excellent, beer is always cold.\n\nPastrami and Swiss was great, but the meal of pork and apple/raisin sauce was out of this world.","Excellent German food.  I went in for an early lunch, the service was great.  Had a whole feast of great dishes.  The best sauerkraut i've ever had -- subtle, with caraway.  Sweet and sour cabbage, potato salad, spaetzle, a great weisswurst, and a great wheat beer on tap.","Best place in town. I love the sampler platter and Sunday brunch is the best deal in town"],"type":["Low Rating","Low Rating","Medium Rating","Medium Rating","Medium Rating","Medium Rating","Medium Rating","Medium

Goulash in the Contrucci household was made of elbow noodles, beef and spaghetti sauce.  I guess you can't believe everything your parents tell you right?  \n\nSo going in here, I was thinking, great...mom's goulash!  What was set in front me looked NOTHING like what I was used to.  It was a mish mosh of veggies,noodles, gravy and some random unidentifiable food items.  I usually eat whatever is put in front of me, so I wasn't scared to dive it.  Sadly, I just didn't like it.  I thought it was actually not very appetizing at all.  I know, I know, this is like \"world famous\" goulash, but I was NOT into it!  \n\nWhat I was into was the German Potato Salad.  I love it, and honestly, I feel like I never get the same version of it anywhere in the Burgh.  This was a no frills version, with scallop sliced potatoes and a thick vinegar sauce.  Maybe a bit too much, but not enough for me to eat it all!  \n\nWould I go back? If someone else really wanted to go there, but I wouldn't suggest it nor would I go on my own.  Oh well, on to the next one right?","This used to be the best German food in town. I have seen a gradual decline in the food over the past several years. The gravies have changed and the Max's Goulash (one of my favorite dishes) has a different sauce (strangely dessert sweet) and change in the protein. The sides are still great, but the food used to be so much better.","The goulash was (sickeningly) sweet and the bread pudding wasn't sweet at all.  But the atmosphere is kind of cool.  And the prices are downright cheap.","After hearing Hofbrauhaus-haters say that Max's Allegheny Tavern is the only place to go in Pittsburgh for German food, my husband and I decided to finally try the restaurant this afternoon.\n\nWe were seated in little booths right next to the bar. They were cozy, but the seats reminded me of old fashioned church pews. Our waitress soon brought us a little basket of four rolls with butter, sauerkraut relish, and apple butter. Though I liked the different varieties of bread, it was nothing special. The relish and apple butter were a nice touch though.\n\nOur waitress was busy with both waiting tables and tending the bar, but she managed to check on us pretty frequently. Our food also came out relatively promptly. I order the Wiener Schnitzel with Potato Pancakes and Spatzle on the side. The Wiener Schnitzel was amazing -- by far the best I've ever had! The veal was tender and the fried surface was perfectly crispy. However, the sides sadly did not match this main dish. The Potato Pancakes were oddly bitter, and I did not enjoy them with either the sour cream or applesauce. I only ate two or three bites and completely stopped eating them. (I must add that Hofbrauhaus's potato pancakes are delicious and something that I order every time that I go there.) I also did not enjoy the Spatzle, but I am accustomed to eating cheese Spatzle.... So I may be reviewing this harshly since I'm just not used to plain Spatzle, but in my opinion, it was terribly bland and watery.\n\nOverall, Max's Allegheny Tavern served one incredible item (Wiener Schnitzel), but everything else was merely mediocre. Because of this, I really don't plan on returning to the restaurant again any time soon. I'll be sticking with the fun environment and overall good food at Hofbrauhaus, actually.","I really thought I'd never be back.  The goulash I had was so so gross.  But then,  was roped in by some friends who were doing a Sunday brunch book club.  Of course I couldn't miss out on tantalizing conversation... so I obliged.  \n\nI really had no clue what they offered for brunch options, but quickly learned they have a a pretty decent size brunch buffet.  I'm not below buffets at all, it's the fat kid in me!  Most things still looked a little questionable to me, but I went for the big ticket items.  Make your own omelets, potato pancakes and dessert.  I'd hit up the buffet again, but still be hasty to check out the regular menu again.  \n\nThe omelet was made right in front of you, so I added cheese, mushrooms, peppers, tomatoes and onions.  I was super excited about it because it was the size of a football.  Sadly, it was pretty tasteless.  I don't think they added any salt or pepper to the egg mix, so it came out really bland, despite loading up on ingredients.  \n\nBut the potato pancakes... I could survive on them forever.  They were amazeballs!  Add some sour cream and I was in potato patch heaven!  I had to keep myself from getting more because of the other thing I loaded up on... dessert.  \n\nThe desserts looked unassuming, but they were also awesome.  I had a smattering of delectable bites.  The scones were so moist and tasty.  I had to stop myself from taking more than 20.  I also had some carrot cake, brownies, cookies among other things I inhaled and didn't pay attention too.  Should I be embarrassed?  Probably.  But I don't care because it was darn good!","I took my boyfriend, a German-food enthusiast, to Max's Allegheny Tavern last night. We had been looking forward to a night out together for a while. \n\nI think the food was good, but it's hard to say, because all I could focus on was the LOUD -- and I mean LOUD -- woman seated behind my boyfriend and me.\n\nHer profanity-laden discussion with her dining partners was so bad that for the first time in my life, I turned around and asked a fellow restaurant patron to take the volume down a few notches. \n\nThe restaurant was almost empty; I have no idea why the host chose to seat a loud party of five next to a couple having a quiet dinner.","FYI: New happy hour specials are awful. Just awful. Sorry guys, as much as i love you   I've got to put my food down somewhere. Even raising the prices on all of the apps to 3.99 would've been better than taking the pierogie (aka potato pockets) special off all together. \n\nWon't be back.","I've been here once because this was an easy place to meet for dinner with a friend. I enjoyed eating here well enough.\n\nI'm honestly not a die-hard fan of German food, although I guess that wouldn't have mattered: a peak at the menu beforehand revealed that this place's menu is mostly Americanized - proof of this is the fact that my salad was topped with French fries (only in Pittsburgh...). Trust me, even if you don't really like German food, there'll at least be a sandwich you'll like here.\n\nThinking about my usual \"overall\" summary, I have to say this place wasn't bad and served as a reasonable place to meet - the beer menu looked nice from what I saw and the atmosphere was pretty cozy and even nostalgic and homely - but man, the dining options really weren't that extraordinary. I'm still torn as to how to feel about its menu, because on the one hand obviously it being Americanized meant even I could find something to enjoy, but on the other I feel bad for the people who do like German food and may not be getting what they hope for. \n\nIt wasn't bad enough that I'd say don't try it and see - just understand it may not be exactly what you expect.","Authentic German fare. German beer. Best soft pretzels in Pittsburgh. Reasonable prices. Friendly service. Very fair portion sizes. You'll be taking a box home. The basement is nice. But sometimes used for private events. Has a very cozy \"grotto\" feel to it.","Want a taste of the old ethnic communities of Pittsburgh? Go to Max's Allegheny Tavern. German never tasted sooo nice!\n\nMenu Fav: Potato Pancake Reuben. Forget the bread and wrap your lips around sweet potato pancakes and loads of corned beef. Try the hot potato salad too.","This place is great for brunch on Sunday! The service is great and the food is delicious. I always leave stuffed and happy.","I have a friend that loves this place, and I have been told it's the best German food in Pittsburgh so I had to give it a try.\n\nI had the Roasted Loin of Pork Stubenkuchen Style with German Style Potato Salad, and Sauerkraut. Everything was really good. The Pork was delicious and that mushroom gravy that they put on it was nothing short of amazing. I want a whole bucket of the stuff to put on everything. The Sauerkraut was interesting featuring shredded pork mixed in. The german potato salad was good but was pretty much what I expected. \n\nTheir draft  beer Selection left a little bit to be desired but featured 5-8 beers many of them popular german style beers. \n\nI got a good idea what this place is all about and I have to say that I will be back for more.","I ordered the Roast Pork loin with Apple raisin dressing, sauerkraut, and German potatoes. Oh yeah... Right Choice! Took a little longer than usual as there was a Large Party of 16 that ordered Just prior to us. Happy to say the waitress took Great care of us, plenty of rolls, drink refills, etc. as we waited. Apple Strudel for the Final Act. So Good, I forgot to take a picture. lol","Diane is awesome, i used to live in PA and\nmoved to CA and this is a great place for a beer,\ncheap food and good friends.\nI miss this place.\nOne of my favorites places back home in PA!","I've been going to Max's off and on for 31 years (I KNOW!  How could someone as young as I am been going there for THAT long?)    And I am not from nor ever lived in the North Side!\n\nThat said...i have always loved the food and the place.   I was great the first time and was great last night!   Most of the mains can be recommended without reservation....last night I had roasted pork with dressing and gravy.  It was deliscious!    As for sides....I ALWAYS have potato pancakes and sweet and sour cabbage.  (Because of my eastern european background I am partial to both cabbage and potatoes.   Do not be afraid of the cabbage unless you dislike sour! \n\nWe didn't have dessert, but did have beer and drinks.   They have a nice selection.\n\nMy only complaint was that the food was slow to come out.   It was a busy Friday night and I wasn't going anywhere so I had anover beer.   No big problem.\n\nGive Max's a try.....it might make your favorite like it did mine!","I have a confession to make........the thing I like most about Max's is their bread!!! They are free....they are fresh made....hot and soft...different kinds....and so so delicious!\nI'm not a big fan of German food, but it's just my personal taste. The portions are large and atmosphere is very relaxing and casual. I like it.","Our first stop in Pittsburgh, what a great start! Had a couple of yuenglings, a warm, salty yummy soft pretzel and a big ole plate of German goodness in da tummy!\n\nThe Peasant Platter had knock wurst, weisswurst and a pork chop on top of heap of sauerkraut...with potato pancakes, spaetzel and a basket of baked breads!  So.much.food.  And oh soooo good!\n\nThe bar is cool, staff is really nice and I believe they offer their patrons a free ride to and from on game days!","We (my fiance and I) went out for a pseudo-couples' date with our good friends, Sara and Thom, to Max's to introduce them to some of the most authentic German food in da Burgh. Where most people associate Hofbrauhaus with the ultimate German beer-hall experience, I prefer Max's for the quieter, less raucous environs. (At least when it's not Oktoberfest)\n\nWe'd been there once before and immediately fell in love with the place. I (still) keep raving about the Sausage and Cheese platter. They've got some good Gouda. The Potato Pockets (pierogies) were OK -- I'd take some Pierogies Plus or Forgotten Taste over Max's, but that's just me.\n\nThe spaetzel was to die for, however. It's like a German Mac n' Cheese. And boy, do I love me some Mac n' Cheese. It literally melts in your mouth with its' ooey-gooey-ness.\n\nDrink-wise, I tried their German lager and Thom tried the sampler. Thom is a beer enthusiast. For around eight bucks, you get a GOOD amount of beers to try -- they are not some dinky little shot glass samples, either. Thom had some trouble near the end finishing it...it was so much beer. Bob had a Captain and ginger-ale...in a king-size goblet. Goblets are the ONLY way to serve adult bevvies.\n\nFor dinner, I had the pork loin over an apple-raisin gravy/bread concoction. The pork loin was flavorful and tender, and quite delicious. Sara had the sauerbraten and seemed to enjoy it. Bob's burger was ginormous and looked extra tasty.\n\nWe finished it off with the Apple Fritters. Now, these fritters aren't for the faint of heart. And they aren't your average dinky small sized portions, either. You get two huge deep fried apple fritters, covered in vanilla ice cream. One person CANNOT eat the whole serving. You must, I repeat MUST share them. If you attempt to eat the whole plate yourself, you will have flavor explosion, followed by severe heartburn. But damn, are they GOOD.\n\nOur visit ended up totaling 2 hours. One thing, though...please fix your outdoor sign. Usually it shines out like a red and blue beacon in the night for people to find their way there, but on Wednesday, it was out. Driving there, I got confused on where it exactly was (but I had a general idea, as I had been there before.).","Max's is my parents' favorite restaurant when they're in town visiting me. Good, solid food with a great deal of [German] variety. I love the German beer flights (i.e., beer sampler) and the atmosphere is funny - a bit like your grandmother's parlor. The bread that comes with entrees is delicious (pumperknickel + others), and their cherry sauer kraut is delicious as well.\n\nThe food is good, but you must be careful with certain dishes. One of the schnitzels that comes with carrots/peas is clearly bedecked in carrots & peas that were recently frozen. German food isn't exactly known for its vegetables, so I let it slide but I always remember not to order that dish when I'm there.","I have been coming to Max Allegheny Tavern since I was still in my mother's womb.  But seriously.  This place has been an institution for my family, and I really love it here.  I feel like this is some of the only German food in Pittsburgh, and I think it represents fairly well.  My thoughts:\n\nBrunch Buffet- I love the Sunday brunch buffet more than life.  Omelette station, German and American breakfast and lunch foods, and lots and lots of beautiful, delicious, and decadent desserts.  It's heaven on Earth.  There is usually a decent selection of meats, and the potato pancakes are almost always featured.  They've changed it a bit over the years, but I still love this buffet.\n\nAppetizers- My family loves the soft pretzels.  They are so yummy and buttery, but a bit heavy if you are going to eat your entire meal.  So make sure to share.\n\nMeals-  I, personally, have never had a bad meal here.  The sauasages of all varieties have been great.  The weinerschnitzel also great.  Sandwiches all good as well.  I really like the cheesy spaetzle dish that is just like macaroni and cheese but with spaetzle noodles!  I don't get too crazy and order anything complicated, though.\n\nSides-  I love love love their sides.  I could live on the spaetzle and potato pancakes.  Don't pass the sides up!\n\nDessert:  Also love their desserts.  There is a chocolate chocolate cake that they heat up with homemade whipped cream that is TO DIE FOR.  Not so shockingly, the apple strudel is wonderful as well.\n\nBesides the food, the servers are always very friendly and efficient.  There is also ample street parking, which is really nice.  Definitley check this place out if you have not yet.","How can there be no reviews of Max's Allegheny? This north side German food institution in Pittsburgh has been around for years and years and has menus that tell you so. They also tell you the story of the north side of Pittsburgh, which I also found interesting. The place itself has a lot of character and looks like it's seen a lot of years there. It's a little weathered, but definitely homey and sturdy.\n\nRandy S. and I headed there post Tazza D'Oro on a Sunday for brunch. It happened to be the same very Sunday the Pens were playing the Flyers in game 7, so all the waitresses were wearing Pens paraphernalia, which definitely added to the experience. On Sunday morning it has a brunch buffet with all the standards, plus a healthy dose of Germanic add ons like German farmers breakfast (eggs, sausage and gravy-ed potatoes), red cabbage, pork chops, sauerkraut and potato pancakes. \n\nThe brunch buffet is in a room with a giant tapestry of Neuschwanstein behind the guys at the omelet bar. If that's not rad, I don't know what is. We told the waitress we were going in, went and got back and sat down to find our two ice teas on the table in mason jars (always dope). \n\nThe food was just what you would expect in Pittsburgh: gut busting. It wasn't artisinal or fancy, healthy or particularly remarkable, but it was pretty fonking good and to eat that food in that restaurant really made me feel like I was in Pittsburgh. I can imagine all the food there would be of the 'hot and brown' category, in a positive way. And the waitress was probably the nicest on our drive from Dallas to CT. \n\nA really fun place, if showing it's age (though remorselessly).","Real german food (sausage, etc) and decent beer in family friendly atmosphere.\n\nThis is one of the good joints.","Max's is a great place for German food.  I've had several sandwiches, most of the appetizers and even the Sunday brunch (which has a good spread but can be hit or miss) -  though not all in one visit.\n\nI most recently took my Mom out for dinner using a Living Social deal I had.  Somehow, even though we have both been to Max's quite a few times before neither of us had ever seen the sampler platter option on their menu.  For just a bit more than the cost of the regular entrees, you can choose three entrees and two sides.  Obviously the portions of each selection are smaller than the individual meals, but the size is still generous and there were only a couple things not available for the sampler platter.  Between the two of us we selected six different items and four different sides to try and shared everything - and still had enough left for a full meal each the next day.  I can't even decide on my favorite of all the items we tried.  If you aren't sure about some of the entrees, this is a great way to see what you like.  I personally loved everything so much that I think my new go-to menu item from now on will be the sampler platter.  Not being forced to choose just one item is what living in America is all about.\n\nAll together I think our bill was around $35 (no alcoholic beverages consumed).  Some might consider this a tad pricey but the food is so good I usually don't mind the slightly higher cost.  Service has never been a problem for me in fact they've always been helpful when I have questions about the menu.  Full bar with numerous good beers on tap.  If you want German food in Pittsburgh, Max's is definitely the place to start.","Quaint spot on a back street in the North Side.  Very polite service, and delicious food at a great value.  Will definitely go back for authentic German fare.","One of my favorite north side haunts. Great to take visitors who need to understand what it means to be German in Pittsburgh. \n\nGet the soft pretzels. Get anything that comes with a potato pancake. Get the kielbasa. Get it all. You can't go wrong. \n\nOh, and the spaetzle. The spaetzle.......","Max's is one of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh.  It's the Kennywood Thunderbolt of Pittsburgh restaurants.  The Thunderbolt is considered one of the best rollercoasters in the country.  It's not the fastest, it's old, it doesn't have the biggest drops or flip you upside-down.  And yet it's great.  It's classic.  This is Max's Allegheny Tavern.  I'm sure there's better German food with cuter waitresses somewhere out there that doesn't have the decor aesthetics of your grandma's living room.  But who cares.  This place is just right.\n\nFinal note, I can't speak for the brunch buffet.  I went in there for the buffet once and decided that my money would be better spent on the menu.","This is my favorite restaurant on the Northside, possibly favorite restaurant in all of Pittsburgh.  I tell all my friends that this little restaurant is the best kept secret in Pittsburgh.  Max's is a quaint little German place that always has plenty of seating, even on Friday and Saturday nights.  The service is good.  The food is great, I always end up getting the potato pancakes.  If you are looking for a place to check out that isn't going to be as crowded and will be more \"authentic\" German food than other places you should definitely come to Max's!","German food and German beer served in a mason jar. Best in Pittsburgh. The history of the tavern and the friendly makes this wish me that I lived closer to Max's.","Tremendous selection of German dishes.  All the sausages come from a particular manufacturer in Wisconsin that uses 100 year old methods of making them (according to the menu).  I don't know if that's a good thing or not, but they taste terrific.  \n\nThe options for sides are as plentiful as the moan dishes and the hot bacon potato salad was awesome.  \n\nDefinitely recommend giving this a try.","Crap!  I can't believe that I missed a \"First to Review\" by just a matter of weeks.  Max's Allegheny Tavern has been a shining star and a \"must\" for my Pittsburgh rotation of places to visit.  Years ago, when I worked on the Northside for Heinz, I spent many a rowdy Friday night here in the basement with factory workers.  \n\nWhat's there to say?  It's a Northside institution and always has a mixed crowd that is super cool and friendly.  The bartenders are friendly and manage to remember my name and drink choice even though I'm here only a few times a year.  My Friday nights here must have made quite an impression!  I love the decor here, dark wood paneling with lots of stained glass, and the downstairs bar is where the naughty people hang.  Jukebox and room for dancing.  The food is very homey and very reasonably priced.  The German nachos are always worth ordering, and they are smothered with Gouda cheese.  The spatzle is also a creamy indulgent treat.  And for those seeking the real Deutsch culinary experience, they have a large variety of sausages and schnitzels.  So it's a sausage factory in more ways than one.","5 stars because I accept it for what it is.  Really good German comfort  food with killer drafts.  And the fact that the place has been there for forever makes it super cool.  I love the player piano and put a quarter in every time!  PS. the popcorn at the bar is sooooooooo good too.","Been coming to Max's for years. Very consistent. \n\nFood is always excellent, beer is always cold.\n\nPastrami and Swiss was great, but the meal of pork and apple/raisin sauce was out of this world.","Excellent German food.  I went in for an early lunch, the service was great.  Had a whole feast of great dishes.  The best sauerkraut i've ever had -- subtle, with caraway.  Sweet and sour cabbage, potato salad, spaetzle, a great weisswurst, and a great wheat beer on tap.","Best place in town. I love the sampler platter and Sunday brunch is the best deal in town"],"type":["Low Rating","Low Rating","Medium Rating","Medium Rating","Medium Rating","Medium Rating","Medium Rating","Medium

hotel and not really having eaten much all day, I was hungry.\n\nThe service was terrible....no one knew what they were doing so it took 10 minutes to get a freaking slice of pizza and then when said pizza came it was NASTY.\n\nMy husband once got a pizza in Milwaukee where they put Kraft singles on it as cheese and Pizza Parma is just behind that for worst pizza ever.","Looking for a quick bite to eat and a local told me this was \"the best pizza in the city.\"  I got a plain slice and a pepperoni slice. Possibly the worst pizza I have ever eaten.  This wouldn't even qualify as pizza in North Jersey.  I ate half of the plain slice because I was starving....then threw both in the garbage.  \n\nIf this is really the best pizza in Pittsburgh... wow.","I ordered from Pizza Parma out of storm necessity. I ordered a chicken parmigiana \"hoagie\", which was dry and luke warm. The potato bacon soup was like something out of a can, except the chunks of potato were hard and undercooked..all pretty nasty and overly salty.\n\nNever order from them.","Zero stars. Came in 10 mins before close. Female manager on duty asked for $100 in exchange for a pizza. When we refused she said she could not serve us because her employees had been working since 9am..,it is currently 2:00 am... Sounds pretty illegal to me","Average pizza. But with ten guys working - and not much business at the moment - it still took twenty minutes to get a slice of pepperoni. I'll walk across the street next time.","My butthole hasn't been right for days, nor my stomach. \n\nWe ordered in because we all had a long day and were set to have a family movie night.\n\nA pizza and hoagie. \n\nThe hoagie wasn't anything to run and go scream from the rooftops about but the pizza was covered in little ass ruining intestinal demons and this I am nearly sure of.\n\nI had to be talked out of sending pizza Parma a bill for several rolls of toilet paper.\n\nBe weary of the pizza, distrustful actually.\n\nYour butthole will thank me for it!","Hubby and I dropped in after a hellish morning at the Social Security office. Hubby loves pizza so we made a stop.\n\nPizza wan't bad, it was actually pretty decent. But the place was disgusting and the cashier was incredibly rude.","I eat this pizza all the time when downtown, usually when running around at events like First Night or the Gallery Crawls...not the best pizza I have ever had in my life, but it's not bad!  And I haven't ever gotten sick from it.  Just wanted to offer a different opinion.","PIzza Parma's decent tasting mega-big-2ft-long hot sausage hoagie was let down by the piss poor attitude of the staff, the lack of cleanliness of the tables and floor, the out-of-order red door restroom, the bright yellow for no-explicable reason walls. \n\nThe large color-striped 80's retro tables and green chairs have come back in style but this win is purely accidental and achieved only by laziness and lack of renovation.\n\nThat is all.","My fiance & I have lived in downtown Pittsburgh for over a year + now & this place is fabulous. \nMy sweetie LOVES LOVES LOVESSS pizza & we order from here a ton.  We haven't ordered anything here that wasn't super tasty.\nThe shop is small & the decor is super bright which makes you want to get in & out quickly but who the hell eats in there anyways. ... you're grabbing your order & running.","I'm glad I listened to my friend's recommendation and not some of these bad reviews. We're just in town for the night and wanted something delivered to our hotel. They said it would take an hour, which I expected on Super Bowl Sunday right at game time, but it was here in less than half an hour. \n\nThe pizza was delicious! Just the right balance of cheese and a tasty sauce, generous with the toppings, and a nicely crispy crust but not too thin.","This place has great service! My best friend and I got 2 custom orders and the older guy in back came out to the register to take our orders personally.  I assume he's either the cook, owner, or both. We ordered 2 cheeselss pizzas; a lot of places mess this up. Pizza Parma however, makes great cheeseless pizza. Our personal pizzas were nice and toasty, not over nor undercooked, and it was not dried out at all! There was more than enough sauce mmmmmmmmm.","My fiance & I have lived in downtown Pittsburgh for over a year + now & this place is fabulous. \nMy sweetie LOVES LOVES LOVESSS pizza & we order from here a ton.

waiter was to be found about ten minutes later they gave us our water and left again! It wasn't even busy! There were only TWO dim sum carts floating around somewhere. Then our waiter finally came around and took our orders of lunch entrees. The food was not even that good as the reviews that are posted on here. When we came up to pay, the bill was super overpriced. I will not be returning here, I am better off eating at Great Wall Cuisine.","If this place had zero stars I would have given them that ! Let me start off by saying I was so excited to read all great reviews so maybe I just came in on a off day? We walked in and were seated came over and asked if we wanted water or tea I guess they don't serve anything Else, Then we placed an order pork dumplings and sticky rice nasty! Then I asked if they served egg rolls they said they were out!!! they pushed their little carts around with hot plates that basically steam the food and is not fresh and what you get is soggy poor customer service we had to get up and look for someone to give us our tab so we could get the heck out of there are get some real food. It looked like it would be a great place for groups of people would not recommend if you are on mission for what you want and want to place an order but it could be a fun experience for some people.","You walk into a Chinese restaurant on a Saturday afternoon for dim sum and you expect the place to be PACKED.  Well, walking in to a pretty much empty dining room, it's a VERY CLEAR SIGN.  But my friend insisted and I was very hesitant for good reasons.  Another indicator, the majority of the patrons were NON Asian.  \n\nFood: You walk in and you see carts of the food by the entrance to the dining room.  Umm, I thought dim sum should come right off the steamer and into the carts and they roll it around, not sitting around.  The dim sum was garbage.  It had the typical selection, but at minimum.  \n\nService: It's ok.  But it doesn't make up for the horrible food.\n\nBottom line: NO WAY!  Stay away!","I've been here many times...Mother's Day with family, dim sum with book club, etc. But I will not go back again.  I stopped in to ask the owner about a donation or reduced price for a class of under-privileged kids that I volunteer with.  His reaction was to scoff and shoo me out the door while handing me his card and saying I could email him.  He turned his back and headed off to the messy newspaper-strewn table he haunts between guests arrivals.  Maybe he's a community-minded business owner, but then again, maybe he's not.  I'll be dining elsewhere.","Being from Chicago, we are used to getting authentic Chinese food all the time.  But when we first starting spending a lot of time in Scottsdale/Phoenix, we found it a challenge to get authentic Chinese food.  We were excited to find the Golden Buddha and have made many trips over the years all the way from the Troon North area to get our fix.  However, service has declined to the point where it is no longer worth the aggravation.  We went there last night for Chinese New Year and will never go back.  Granted they were very busy because of a lot of large tables there, but waiting almost an hour to get our food is not acceptable under any circumstance!  45 mins. into our wait, the waitress came back (after we flagged her down to ask about our food) and said one of the dishes we ordered was not available....after 45 mins.!!!! What makes the whole experience an unforgivable one is that the manager/owner is so indifferent and never apologized or offered a discount off the bill...nothing.  When we left, the same manager was at the piano singing in Chinese. Huh?  Other than Nee House in Scottsdale, the search goes on for a restaurant that serves authentic Chinese food closer to home.","I will NEVER go there again.  I reserved a table for a group of 16 people for 5:00 PM on Christmas Eve .  The person on the phone ( I believe the manager) repeatedly asked me to call ahead and give him an accurate head count since he said they'd be swamped that day.  I followed up with him twice.  \nWhen the first couple of us arrived, we had menus shoved in our faces immediately and told we \"Must order now.  Must order now\" because they were going to be busy later on.  The place was practically empty.  As each person arrived, they were treated the same way. \nWe rushed and placed our orders and then they brought out our checks WAY before we saw any sign of our food.  I have never in my life been treated so rudely by a restaurant.\nIt was utter chaos when the food started coming out while everyone struggled to get the correct dish they ordered.  One person didn't get her food until we were all just about finished eating. \nOne top of all that, the food wasn't even good.  I've had better Kung Pao Chicken at Panda Express!\nAfter being rushed through our meal, the place wasn't even half full by the time we left.  I thought being at the Cultural Center, this restaurant would be a sure thing but boy was I wrong.  Lovely way to spend Christmas Eve..","If you are looking a chinese restaurant to host a big party look some other than the Golden Buddah.  I recently attended a banquet at the Golden Buddah and I was shocked at the level of quality of food and service.  Of the 10 dishes served 4 were nearly inedible.  \n\nThere was a crab claw appetizer, most chinese restaurants prepare this dish by taking a crab claw surrounding it with ground shrimp, batter and then deep fry.  At Golden Buddah, the crab claw served was mostly batter.  \n\nThe shark fin soup served was mostly broth.  Shark fin is an expensive ingredient and most places usually use imitation shark fin, but come on at least put something in there so that I know I'm eating soup and not dirty sink water.  \n\nGinger scallion lobster is battered, fried, and then stir fried in a sauce with ginger and scallions.  The ginger scallion lobster served was over-cooked and dried out.  \n\nLastly, there was a steamed fish.  The fish was raw in the middle.   \n\nIt wasn't all bad, there was a crispy chicken with garlic dish that was pretty good, but out of 10 dishes 4 were bad, 5 were okay, and 1 was good.  \n\nDoes 4 bad dishes out of 10 warrant a one star rating?  Well it does when you factor in the service.  The soup, appetizer, and first entree arrived timely, but after that there was a 1 hour gap before we received the next dish.  The dishes were not served with accompanying white rice which I thought was odd.  We had to ask for it, and even the rice took a while to arrive.","I agree with Crystal C., that the dim sum isn't the greatest I've ever had. In fact, I am not sure if the meal was so tasty that it was memorable. I do remember the \"calamari\" was not really calamari, like you would think. It was presented more like a sweet and sour pork (so calamari with LOTS of breading) without any sauce. As a result, the dish was dry and salty.\n\nThe sticky rice was good (hard to mess up), the chicken feet were okay (needed more five spice powder), and the shumai was alright. The noodles were good, and I can see why the cart ran out after the first round. The diners were an equal mix of Asians and Americans. I would've preferred to see more Asians eating (as I am used to in a Chinatown and gives an indication of authenticity), but I do realize we're in Phoenix where the Asian population is not like San Francisco or Houston. \n\nThe meal came to about $30 for two, including jasmine tea. The carts are loud because they are made out of metal and roll on tile. I am also not used to staff members shouting what they have in their cart, like a newspaper boy yelling \"Extra! Extra!\" Christmas music was playing after mid-January, so the atmosphere felt strange. Next time I visit the city, I probably will pass.","Can't say that I was very impressed. Came for dinner in a hopeful and enthusiastic mood since the reviews have been pretty good, but I don't think this place lives up to its current good, but declining rating.\n\nOrdered the Combo fried rice (shrimp, chicken, beef, pork), sesame chicken, and garlic fried chicken. \n\nThe combo fried rice was pretty good, but ended up drinking about 6 glasses of water due to the MSG and sodium content. You'd think that the cook spent his better years in the French Foreign Legion in the Sahara eating salt tablets and developed a taste for them. \n\nThe sesame chicken had a good flavor and a thick brown sweet sauce. I liked it a lot until it got cool and the sauce looked (with that stringy consistency) more like glue. You think I'm kidding? I'm not.\n\nGarlic fried chicken was bad. Just bad. It was like an over roasted dried out half chicken with some dried garlic pieces sprinkled on top. No spices, no flavor, no good. \n\nWe then got all kinds of lip from the waitress when we asked if they could change the channel on the TV from college football, to the Suns game. They made it into this big deal that the \"customers\" wanted to see the football game. Yeah right, it was University of West Virginia Vs. University of Connecticut! I would have believed it if it was a local team....\n\nIt's better than a 1 star joint, but only because it's borderline edible. To be avoided.","This restaurant is located in the Chinese Cultural Center and was the one restaurant that I had not been to. So after some shopping at one of the shops, we stepped in to have dinner.\n\nWe stepped in and asked for a seat for two. We were seated immediately. The place was decorated nicely and a lady playing the piano made for great ambiance.\n\nWe looked at the menu briefly and ordered our drinks, an appetizer, a soup and two main dishes. The drinks came out promptly and so did the rest of the meal. My goodness everything we ordered was very tasty.\n\nThe waiter service itself however was not even close to the decor and food. He never introduced himself, and although he took our order, our food itself was brought out by a kitchen person.\n\nAfter we ordered our waiter really never came back asking if we needed anything else, except to give us our check at the end and that was after the person I was dining with got up and asked a different waiter for it.\n\nIt's amazing how a place with great food, decor, and ambiance can mess it all up by crappy waiter service.","I love Dim Sum, my favorite Chinese dish.\n\nWhen Golden Buddha first open, they have excellent Dim sum. I went there many times, I tell my friend how good it is, But now,  they change cook, taste more like  week old left over. Rumor has it, they change cook every few month, so Quality of cooking change. (not sure if that is true, but that is what I was told.)\nMy advice is; when you walk in the door and the place is pack, = Good Cook. if the place is bare = bad cook. leave immediately. don't waste your money.","If you just \"want\" dim sum, go here. If you are \"craving\" dim sum, go elsewhere (take a 5 hour drive west to neighboring state, California).\n\nAnyway, I've been visiting Golden Buddha in the noontime for roughly 2 years now. I believe they moved from their original site (7th St. & Osborn), formerly \"China Doll.\" Relocation brought along better atmosphere and smiling faces. This does not mean, better dim sum. But since we are in Phoenix, I will settle for what they have to offer. \n\nBe mindful of the dim sum tab. It's itemized high-medium-low. \n\nShaomai can be found as combinations of pork/mushroom, shrimp, or shark fin (which should not be confused as true shark bits, as the shaomai is prepared to look like a shark's fin). These picks are okay...perhaps on a better day shao mai will be served in less-rigid, or fresher wrappers. Potstickers are okay as well, just the usual scallion and pork, and dry wrapper. The baby pork ribs in light black bean sauce and jalapenos is alright, but sometimes lacks in taste. Tripe is also served in its bare minimum...so if you enjoy the texture and flavor of tripe, try this with its clear sauce and thinly sliced carrots and celery.  \nBuche (that's what I call it), or fried sesame balls are also available, although if you wait until dessert, they will also be a bit stiff. There are a few other things that may be \"spotted\" but are not worth mentioning. \n\nDon't order from their lunch menu, as you can find these over-salted dishes at Panda Express anyway. \n\nOverall, dim sum at Golden Buddha is a place to go if you are around the vicinity and feel like having something apart from the usual fast food. However, discriminating palates- beware.","Not impressed with this place at all. This was not the friendliest place around, maybe because of the language barrier (most or all were clearly native Chinese speakers), or maybe just the attitude of the employees.\n\nI ordered the sweet and sour chicken lunch, which came with the typical egg drop soup, crab rangoon, and egg roll. The soup was ok - maybe it's just me, but I prefer a real spoon to the scoop that they gave me. The egg roll was tiny and not that great, and the crab rangoon was ok, but maybe a little undercooked. The chicken wasn't bad, but nothing special, as was the rice and other stuff on the plate.\n\nOverall, this was just not my kind of Chinese place.","Disappointing.  Mediocre at best.  I am staying at the Aloft hotel in phoenix and ordered some delivery. I ordered a couple american chinese food staples: general tso's chicken, dumplings and hot&sour soup.  Soup had zero flavor, dumplings tasted freezer burned and processed.  General tso chicken was ehh. \n\nA lot of good reviews on here so it must be for eat in and for their dim sum.  Don't order delivery, you will be left hungry and unsatisfied.","Went there on Saturday for early lunch.  My wife did the dim sum, it was okay, we were both disgusted by the sugar cane shrimp; but the rest was good.  \n\nI ordered the chicken szechwuan, the waitress warned me it was \"spicy\" the reason I ordered it.  It came out delicious, but not what I would call spicy.  Overall its hard to find good Chinese in the valley and I would call this good without hesitation.","So I was referred to this place from the front desk of my hotel. I'm from SF so I'm coming from a place with really good chinese food. \n\nThe dim sum is just \"ok\" nothing for me to write home about. The one dish that I really liked was the chinese broccoli cooked with garlic sauce. Yum yum yum.  It's in a big bowl, not oily, not saucy, just really good. I think it's $7.50.  \n\nIt's a somewhat pricey and just like all chinese restaurants, it's not the cleanest.  The chair was filthy.  the dishes weren't all that great.  I wouldn't go back unless I want the chinese broccoli.  \n\nSo I went on a Sunday and it was not crowded at all. There's not a huge asian population  in Phoenix (not that I could tell) so I don't think there's a high demand for dim sum.  And also, I sooooooo felt like taking a pic of this, but a Mexican lady was pushing one of the dim sum carts. That is unheard of in SF.  This is a mainly mandarin restaurant and the dim sum places I go are usually cantonese.  Not a big deal though since the dishes look the same. \n\nDude, there was a turtle in the fish tank that I saw as I left.  I hope they don't eat that!","A Premier Chinese Atmosphere,\nThe Chinese cultural center and Asian Garden produces an Asain atmosphere that can be recognized from the 202.  \n With Dim Sum served this location earns its respect from the local community.\n\nDim Sum tip,  You have to be smart with the Dim Sum ladies they look nice innocent but they are professional sales people that will sell you more dishes than you need before you know what to do.  \n\nI love the desserts here ask the server to see the dessert tray.","This restaurant has a bit of an identity crisis. It is in the Chinese cultural center, but serves Japanese beer (Kirin on tap!) and the live piano music is American pop. We had to ask for chopsticks.\n\nHaving said that, the service was professional. Our waiter held a hot appetizer for one of our party who was away from the table so that it would not be cold when he returned. We were asked frequently--and not too frequently--if things were ok both by our waiter and the manager/proprietor.\n\nThe food was ok-to-good. Fried shrimp egg rolls were dainty but yummy. Duck was tasty but very chewy. Kung-pao chicken was pleasantly spiced. Plenty of rice. A pitcher of ice water with lemon was left at the table. \n\nAtmosphere was also pleasant. Chairs comfortable, tables spaced well, restrooms large and clean...and there is indeed a large golden Buddha by the entrance.","I took a group of friends here and relatives other times. The place is consistently good for Dim-sum during lunch. It is typical Chinese and nothing fancy.\n\nWhat helps this place is the moat scenery.  3 stars for visiting here based on convenience since there are similar places in town.","Having grown up in Hong Kong and having eaten dim sum in London, NY, LA, SF and Vancouver (actually Richmond), I can confidently say I know my dim sum.\n\nGood selection of well-executed dim sum when the carts actually come around and there's anything left in it.  I'd give it 4 stars for food but the wait definitely detracted from the whole experience.\n\nI think the problem with Golden Buddha is that they can't handle the heavy flow on weekends.  There's not enough regular dim sum eaters like LA that can sustain a steady flow of diners throughout the week, forcing restaurants like Golden Buddha to depend heavily on extra part-time help on weekends.  \n\nDim sum takes serious skill so the chef still ends up doing most of the work.  When we looked into the kitchen, we saw a Chinese woman doing most of the cooking herself.  No wonder it took forever for a cart to come out and when it does, it's swarmed on by a pack of vultures.\n\nIf you're willing to eat at a more simply decorated place with a smaller menu, I'd highly recommend China Chan.  It's much more relaxed - usually no wait on weekends.  An experienced chef makes all the dim sum himself so the menu's much shorter but all the classics are on it.  Anything steamed is made to order so is very fresh.","Situated in the Chinese Cultural Center near the SkyHarbor Airport, this was another pleasant find. All I had was the Dim Sum menu, and I would say this is the best you're gonna get in Phoenix. Still worth the stop to get your Dim Sum fix. The cart ladies were pleasant and very happy to converse with me in Cantonese. Only downside was the chicken sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaves, naw mei gai, was way overcooked, and mushy.","Do you want to eat Chinese Food in an elegant environment on a Friday night in Phoenix? \n\nBe entertained by classic, quiet standards being played live on a piano while you dine?\n\nAre you 50 years old and Caucasian?\n\nThen the Golden Buddha is the place for you! \n\nIts in the Chinese Cultural Center Mall on 44th, and a popular weekend spot for Dim Sum. For a DIm Sum starved Valley of the Sun, Golden Buddha's is decent. \n\nFor dinner, though, it is awfully Americanized and not very authentic Chinese. But with a bunch of American customers coming for dinner, what do you expect? They probably think they are getting \"real Chinese\" food by going to the Chinese Mall, but then again, they are used to PF Chang's or Stix normally in their neighborhood, so this is a step up.\n\nThe best thing about this place is the decor, which is clean and nice, with a Hong Kong Junk boat design covering the ceiling from the bar into the dining room. The next best thing is the Piano interludes on weekend nights. The service is next, which is a little overly eager to remove your plate, and the last thing is the food. \n\nThey do give decent portions. I ordered Guo Teh (potstickers) and got 6 fat ones. But they weren't served with the usual soy, chili oil and vinegar, but a soy and green onions mixture. The Mapo Tofu was ok, as they used a nice silky tofu, which was nice, but no green onions, and sliced black mushrooms instead, which I like, but not in this dish.\n\nCome here for the ambiance and music in the evenings, or on the weekend days for Dim Sum.","Decent dim sum, especially to be found in the middle of the desert. Sadly, the best food I've had in Phoenix.","This place is a little difficult for me to review.  I was staying at the Hampton Inn across the street and this is the closest restaurant so off I went.\n\nI walked in and the owner or manager met me at the door and asked \"how many\"?\n\nI told him I wanted to order take out and handed me a menu and pointed to the waiting area which was covered in newspapers.  I chose to go to the bar, order a glass of wine, and peruse the menu.\n\nThe drinks are expensive but I didn't think the food was.  Less than $10 for my Mongolian Chicken which came with white sticky rice and a fortune cookie.  When ordering I asked if I could have fried rice instead of white rice but was told \"no\".  Most places allow this for a nominal fee.\n\nFine by me.  Give the white rice.  Food was prepared and their to-go boxes were a lot better than the standard white Chinese \"to go\" boxes.  They also included the plastic-ware, napkin, and soy sauce, which a lot of places forget.\n\nLooking around I found a whole lot of goodness along with a couple disappointments.  Most notably the newspaper strewn about and behind the bar, to the right were a lot of boxes stacked in an unsightly fashion.  I could have been a little more presentable in my opinion.\n\nI peeked into the dining room because I wanted to see if the piano music was piped in or live.  It was live which was very nice. Also, the dinning room looked very nice and cozy.\n\nAs I was leaving the same man who greeted me upon entering made sure to wish me a good evening.  My initial impression of the man was that he was surly and testy but that's just how he comes off.\n\nThe food was very good.  The Mongolian sauce was mixture of sweet with spice and the chicken and vegetables all tasted fresh.","My husband and I went there Saturday, the service was great!  Our friends were going to be late so they told us to start.  And start we did!\nThey were serving Dim Sum, something we had never tried, so glad we did, it was wonderful, hubby wouldn't do the chicken feet, but I think next time I will, it looked very good.\nOur friends showed up and ordered their food, and ate all of it, they said that usually they take food home, but it was so good they had to eat all of it!\nWe will be going back very soon!","Let's see, over 50... check \nold white man...........check \neats dinner ...............check \nlistens to the piano  check \n\nwow this must be the place for me, I mean after all it is in a Chinese mall, no make that a Chinese Cultural Center. How could I possibly have discerning taste with such trickery to get me here to eat. \nDude if you are going to rate a restaurant no need to degrade others with your arrogance. \nFool is my review of wanugee N. \n\nNow on the restaurant. The last time we were here the food was not good, the piano was too loud and the waitress had a real attitude. IT won't keep me from going back as I have had good meals and wait service too. \n\nBack to wanugee N. I do not expect any place in Phx. to have authentic Chinese food, by that I mean the street food one finds in China. \nBut I do expect what I fork in to my mouth is worth what I am going to fork over in cost. Even an old white guy like me can tell the difference between good and bad food. No matter what it is called.","Okay so Ive been glum the past few days as I have an impending birthday. Every year this time I get all down in the dumps.. not that I'm not happy with my life cause life is good. Its more like getting further away from my youth and closer to being well, old. All of my grandparents were crotchety, sourpuss drama queens.. is that my fate? Can I break the mold or am I to going to be a crotchety sourpuss?\n\nSo as I contemplate and figure out what I'm going to do with my birthday baggage I decide to squash it with food. All weekend Ive been eating out and having a good time. This is one of the few times outside of a vacation where I will live it completely and to the near of sheer gluttony. So why not dim sum? \n\nIve chowed much dim sum in my 36 years of earthen wear.. of course some good and some bad. I have never been to a place where every dish was great.. Golden Buddha is no exception to this.. they do the basics well enough and have enough funky cool Asian style to keep me interested in returning. The carts around 1130 flow well but around noon it' s full blown freeway action! In fact there might be some road kill in there based on some of the looks on that last steam cart.. \n\nMe and 3 others who were feeling my pain ordered 14, count them, 14 different dishes. One of my friends is from Georgia and had never had dim sum but he is so courageous and unflinching that he was just a blast. Just the shot in the arm to get me out of my funk. I remember the first time I had dim sum.. my eyes wide open, nostrils flared and excited to see what was under the next steamer lid. That was him today.. one exciting thing after the next.. he was even willing to try chicken feet but this is one of those dishes not done very well here. \n\nMy friend took me back to a time where I was younger and less experienced. He looked up to me to guide him through the noodles, bao and sui mai.. like a big brother.. I'm privileged that I could show him something new and exciting and he was so into it! So instead of feeling sorry for myself I felt experienced and useful.. that there is something I can give back to others.. that its not all about me and me aging but about what can be shared with others.\n\nThere is so much more to do, give and feel in this short time we are here.. and Ill do it to, one bite at a time.","The best to be found in land locked Arizona.  My favorite sticky rice is here.  They have dim sum every day, but not a huge selection, though you can order off the menu.  I think it is much bigger on the weekends.  I'm just happy I can get my fix 7 days a week.  Beautiful gardens to walk through, with fish ponds, and a 99 market next door!","I ate at Golden Buddha a few weeks ago.  We ate at the restaurant after a day at the zoo with our 4 year old and had a blast.  The piano bar played tunes for my daughter and the staff was more than accommodating.  The general tso chicken was better than anything I can get in Tucson.  The soup was chocked full of fresh, read FRESH, not canned, vegetables.  All in all, I was very satisfied with the meal and the service.  Plus the decor is very nice, clean and cheery. \n\nEat at Golden Buddha.","For those who gave this place low marks, forgive me. I really like this place. Now I haven't tried various dim sum places so I'm reserving the right to downgrade the place as needed. The variety of food is plentiful, and the carts just keep on coming. I love the steamed pork buns, and the shiu mai (not sure if I spelled that correctly). Yesterday, my favorite pick was the deep fried rolls of taro and shrimp. YUM! I have never ordered from their menu so I can only talk about their dim sum. My friends and I try to go eat dim sum almost every Sunday. It's a cheap way to try new foods, and if you don't like it, well.. you can get away with pushing it aside with minimal guilt. Give it a try! You might be surprised.","I like Golden Buddha, have taken many friends there for Dim Sum.  \nTry not to \"hit\" the dumpling cart to heavy; otherwise cannot finish it to the dessert cart (LOL).\nLove the jasmine tea and the staff willing to help you if you do not understand the what each item is.\nSingapore Rice Noodles a favorite, along with any of the shrimp dumplings; also the broccoli and green beans.\nOnly wish that the carts with eggplant stuffed with shrimp or green peppers with shrimp were not on \"heated\" carts; by the time it gets to you the food is cold.\nOnly concern is that went on 22MAY2010 at 1:30PM; there was a closed sign due to electricity???\nREVISED: 26MAY2010 - called this evening - looks like they are back open again.","I've been to the Golden Buddha on several occasions and it is my favorite, by far, for honest Chinese food. \nWhile I've sampled everything from their vegetarian to their beef, I love their mandarin chicken. More recently, I was delighted to relive the wonders of their Kung Pao Chicken and Beef with Broccoli. \nI absolutely love the egg drop soup and mini crab rangoons that come with the meal.","The very first time I went to Golden Buddha was with my BFF and it was our first dim sum experience. Little did I know this would forever change my life and eating experiences. Although I must admit that first time was a bit awkward.\n\nGB wisely takes reservations which was wonderful (even though it wasn't crazy busy). Our assorted dim sum plates were flavorful and fresh. And the carts seemed to be in constant rotation so we were never too far from a good selection.\n\nWhat really helps GB is its location. The Cofco Center is an experience in itself, where one can have herbs specially blended, select a fresh member of marine life to take home and cook or browse through a store with one of the largest selections of Buddhas and hand fans I've experienced outside of San Francisco.","I've been to Golden Buddha a few times and have not been disappointed. \n\nThey have a LARGE selection of Dim Sum and if you're not careful you can get carried away.\n\nTry and get there early and you'll get the best and most fresh selection.\nMake sure you walk around the garden when you're done.","Probably the most comprehensive Chinese menu in the Valley.  Pick from well over 100 dishes, but if you want the best order the Peking Duck.  Everything else is very good, but without a wow factor.  You'll see lots of Chinese people in this massive restaurant, which probably means they're doing a fine job in the kitchen.","I very much enjoyed eating here. Food was great. Fairly fast service. Wasn't expensive either for the 4 of us.","Golden Buddha has GREAT dim sum.  Their prices are reasonable and the staff is very polite wheeling their little carts.  I tend to go on the weekend because there is more selection but they do dim sum throughout the week.  They also have some very authentic dishes on the menu for those who are more of the adventurous types.  Be sure to say hello to the turtles the next time you go.","This place in the Chinese Cultural Center has a very pretty and elegant bar area. I was pleased to learn that they had some very reasonable and delicious happy hour snacks. This is a good place for a Pina Colada. I had one by myself along with some dumplings and fried shrimp appetizer. Sadly I never brought anyone else here with me. It was happy hour heaven but you know? A lot of my friends in AZ pretty much hang out in one neighborhood or another and nobody I know really lives close to the Buddha.\nThe airport is pretty close by. This might be a good pre-flight send-off location.","I have had dim sum in New Orleans and Phoenix (not SF), and this is about equal to the best of New Orleans as far as flavor.\nAs for ambiance, today was a good day. I've had dim sum here about a dozen times, and have had very good service and quality 90% of the time, including weekends. I have had bad days here, but since today was good, I'll rate accordingly. It's closer to a 4.5, but since I can't give half-stars, I rounded up.\nDon't expect me to give these the right names, but... I was less than impressed with the bbq pork balls. They tasted too much like honey and the beef was minimal. The bbq sauce tasted bottled. Outside of that, their herbal hot tea is delicious even on a hot day.\nThe shu mai were very good, and the shrimp in a spinach dumpling was fantastic. A definite don't miss is their sticky rice in lotus leaf. It's among the best I've had anywhere. Just be careful; you'll find bones in it every once in a while. Go for any of their steamed dumplings; they're very flavorful. As others have said, I love the Chinese broccoli, but you'll only find it on the carts on weekends. Otherwise order it off the menu.\nToday (11:30 lunch) the carts came around often, and everything except the pork buns was piping hot and fresh. By the way, despite the price increases, even the sticky rice was considered a medium size entree, and the two of us eating there escaped with a bill under $20 and we were done in under 30 minutes.\nI strongly recommend the dim sum here, whether you've had it a million times or have never had it before. You usually won't be disappointed.","I don't really understand the poor reviews on this place.....maybe it depends on the day you go? We went on a Sunday, it was crazy busy, but service was great! (of course, my view of customer service is a little different then the rest... I used to live on an island where you were just happy to find what you were looking for, let alone expect good customer service) Anyways, our server was very sweet! Always had a smile on her face. The carts served us promplty and none of the food was cold. They always had whatever we wanted (I hate having to wait for the next cart).\n\nNow, as for the actual dim sum and food.......holy cow, to die for! So flavorful and fresh!! The broccoli makes you sing...and the wine noodles, make you cry. You leave with very weird mixed emotions, but mostly a happy belly full of yummy food.\n\nIn my opinion, this is the best dim sum I have been able to find in Phx. I'm ditching my previous spot (Mekong Palace) and will be back to Golden Buddha when the dim sum monster strikes again!"],"type":["Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low

hotel and not really having eaten much all day, I was hungry.\n\nThe service was terrible....no one knew what they were doing so it took 10 minutes to get a freaking slice of pizza and then when said pizza came it was NASTY.\n\nMy husband once got a pizza in Milwaukee where they put Kraft singles on it as cheese and Pizza Parma is just behind that for worst pizza ever.","Looking for a quick bite to eat and a local told me this was \"the best pizza in the city.\"  I got a plain slice and a pepperoni slice. Possibly the worst pizza I have ever eaten.  This wouldn't even qualify as pizza in North Jersey.  I ate half of the plain slice because I was starving....then threw both in the garbage.  \n\nIf this is really the best pizza in Pittsburgh... wow.","I ordered from Pizza Parma out of storm necessity. I ordered a chicken parmigiana \"hoagie\", which was dry and luke warm. The potato bacon soup was like something out of a can, except the chunks of potato were hard and undercooked..all pretty nasty and overly salty.\n\nNever order from them.","Zero stars. Came in 10 mins before close. Female manager on duty asked for $100 in exchange for a pizza. When we refused she said she could not serve us because her employees had been working since 9am..,it is currently 2:00 am... Sounds pretty illegal to me","Average pizza. But with ten guys working - and not much business at the moment - it still took twenty minutes to get a slice of pepperoni. I'll walk across the street next time.","My butthole hasn't been right for days, nor my stomach. \n\nWe ordered in because we all had a long day and were set to have a family movie night.\n\nA pizza and hoagie. \n\nThe hoagie wasn't anything to run and go scream from the rooftops about but the pizza was covered in little ass ruining intestinal demons and this I am nearly sure of.\n\nI had to be talked out of sending pizza Parma a bill for several rolls of toilet paper.\n\nBe weary of the pizza, distrustful actually.\n\nYour butthole will thank me for it!","Hubby and I dropped in after a hellish morning at the Social Security office. Hubby loves pizza so we made a stop.\n\nPizza wan't bad, it was actually pretty decent. But the place was disgusting and the cashier was incredibly rude.","I eat this pizza all the time when downtown, usually when running around at events like First Night or the Gallery Crawls...not the best pizza I have ever had in my life, but it's not bad!  And I haven't ever gotten sick from it.  Just wanted to offer a different opinion.","PIzza Parma's decent tasting mega-big-2ft-long hot sausage hoagie was let down by the piss poor attitude of the staff, the lack of cleanliness of the tables and floor, the out-of-order red door restroom, the bright yellow for no-explicable reason walls. \n\nThe large color-striped 80's retro tables and green chairs have come back in style but this win is purely accidental and achieved only by laziness and lack of renovation.\n\nThat is all.","My fiance & I have lived in downtown Pittsburgh for over a year + now & this place is fabulous. \nMy sweetie LOVES LOVES LOVESSS pizza & we order from here a ton.  We haven't ordered anything here that wasn't super tasty.\nThe shop is small & the decor is super bright which makes you want to get in & out quickly but who the hell eats in there anyways. ... you're grabbing your order & running.","I'm glad I listened to my friend's recommendation and not some of these bad reviews. We're just in town for the night and wanted something delivered to our hotel. They said it would take an hour, which I expected on Super Bowl Sunday right at game time, but it was here in less than half an hour. \n\nThe pizza was delicious! Just the right balance of cheese and a tasty sauce, generous with the toppings, and a nicely crispy crust but not too thin.","This place has great service! My best friend and I got 2 custom orders and the older guy in back came out to the register to take our orders personally.  I assume he's either the cook, owner, or both. We ordered 2 cheeselss pizzas; a lot of places mess this up. Pizza Parma however, makes great cheeseless pizza. Our personal pizzas were nice and toasty, not over nor undercooked, and it was not dried out at all! There was more than enough sauce mmmmmmmmm.","My fiance & I have lived in downtown Pittsburgh for over a year + now & this place is fabulous. \nMy sweetie LOVES LOVES LOVESSS pizza & we order from here a ton.

waiter was to be found about ten minutes later they gave us our water and left again! It wasn't even busy! There were only TWO dim sum carts floating around somewhere. Then our waiter finally came around and took our orders of lunch entrees. The food was not even that good as the reviews that are posted on here. When we came up to pay, the bill was super overpriced. I will not be returning here, I am better off eating at Great Wall Cuisine.","If this place had zero stars I would have given them that ! Let me start off by saying I was so excited to read all great reviews so maybe I just came in on a off day? We walked in and were seated came over and asked if we wanted water or tea I guess they don't serve anything Else, Then we placed an order pork dumplings and sticky rice nasty! Then I asked if they served egg rolls they said they were out!!! they pushed their little carts around with hot plates that basically steam the food and is not fresh and what you get is soggy poor customer service we had to get up and look for someone to give us our tab so we could get the heck out of there are get some real food. It looked like it would be a great place for groups of people would not recommend if you are on mission for what you want and want to place an order but it could be a fun experience for some people.","You walk into a Chinese restaurant on a Saturday afternoon for dim sum and you expect the place to be PACKED.  Well, walking in to a pretty much empty dining room, it's a VERY CLEAR SIGN.  But my friend insisted and I was very hesitant for good reasons.  Another indicator, the majority of the patrons were NON Asian.  \n\nFood: You walk in and you see carts of the food by the entrance to the dining room.  Umm, I thought dim sum should come right off the steamer and into the carts and they roll it around, not sitting around.  The dim sum was garbage.  It had the typical selection, but at minimum.  \n\nService: It's ok.  But it doesn't make up for the horrible food.\n\nBottom line: NO WAY!  Stay away!","I've been here many times...Mother's Day with family, dim sum with book club, etc. But I will not go back again.  I stopped in to ask the owner about a donation or reduced price for a class of under-privileged kids that I volunteer with.  His reaction was to scoff and shoo me out the door while handing me his card and saying I could email him.  He turned his back and headed off to the messy newspaper-strewn table he haunts between guests arrivals.  Maybe he's a community-minded business owner, but then again, maybe he's not.  I'll be dining elsewhere.","Being from Chicago, we are used to getting authentic Chinese food all the time.  But when we first starting spending a lot of time in Scottsdale/Phoenix, we found it a challenge to get authentic Chinese food.  We were excited to find the Golden Buddha and have made many trips over the years all the way from the Troon North area to get our fix.  However, service has declined to the point where it is no longer worth the aggravation.  We went there last night for Chinese New Year and will never go back.  Granted they were very busy because of a lot of large tables there, but waiting almost an hour to get our food is not acceptable under any circumstance!  45 mins. into our wait, the waitress came back (after we flagged her down to ask about our food) and said one of the dishes we ordered was not available....after 45 mins.!!!! What makes the whole experience an unforgivable one is that the manager/owner is so indifferent and never apologized or offered a discount off the bill...nothing.  When we left, the same manager was at the piano singing in Chinese. Huh?  Other than Nee House in Scottsdale, the search goes on for a restaurant that serves authentic Chinese food closer to home.","I will NEVER go there again.  I reserved a table for a group of 16 people for 5:00 PM on Christmas Eve .  The person on the phone ( I believe the manager) repeatedly asked me to call ahead and give him an accurate head count since he said they'd be swamped that day.  I followed up with him twice.  \nWhen the first couple of us arrived, we had menus shoved in our faces immediately and told we \"Must order now.  Must order now\" because they were going to be busy later on.  The place was practically empty.  As each person arrived, they were treated the same way. \nWe rushed and placed our orders and then they brought out our checks WAY before we saw any sign of our food.  I have never in my life been treated so rudely by a restaurant.\nIt was utter chaos when the food started coming out while everyone struggled to get the correct dish they ordered.  One person didn't get her food until we were all just about finished eating. \nOne top of all that, the food wasn't even good.  I've had better Kung Pao Chicken at Panda Express!\nAfter being rushed through our meal, the place wasn't even half full by the time we left.  I thought being at the Cultural Center, this restaurant would be a sure thing but boy was I wrong.  Lovely way to spend Christmas Eve..","If you are looking a chinese restaurant to host a big party look some other than the Golden Buddah.  I recently attended a banquet at the Golden Buddah and I was shocked at the level of quality of food and service.  Of the 10 dishes served 4 were nearly inedible.  \n\nThere was a crab claw appetizer, most chinese restaurants prepare this dish by taking a crab claw surrounding it with ground shrimp, batter and then deep fry.  At Golden Buddah, the crab claw served was mostly batter.  \n\nThe shark fin soup served was mostly broth.  Shark fin is an expensive ingredient and most places usually use imitation shark fin, but come on at least put something in there so that I know I'm eating soup and not dirty sink water.  \n\nGinger scallion lobster is battered, fried, and then stir fried in a sauce with ginger and scallions.  The ginger scallion lobster served was over-cooked and dried out.  \n\nLastly, there was a steamed fish.  The fish was raw in the middle.   \n\nIt wasn't all bad, there was a crispy chicken with garlic dish that was pretty good, but out of 10 dishes 4 were bad, 5 were okay, and 1 was good.  \n\nDoes 4 bad dishes out of 10 warrant a one star rating?  Well it does when you factor in the service.  The soup, appetizer, and first entree arrived timely, but after that there was a 1 hour gap before we received the next dish.  The dishes were not served with accompanying white rice which I thought was odd.  We had to ask for it, and even the rice took a while to arrive.","I agree with Crystal C., that the dim sum isn't the greatest I've ever had. In fact, I am not sure if the meal was so tasty that it was memorable. I do remember the \"calamari\" was not really calamari, like you would think. It was presented more like a sweet and sour pork (so calamari with LOTS of breading) without any sauce. As a result, the dish was dry and salty.\n\nThe sticky rice was good (hard to mess up), the chicken feet were okay (needed more five spice powder), and the shumai was alright. The noodles were good, and I can see why the cart ran out after the first round. The diners were an equal mix of Asians and Americans. I would've preferred to see more Asians eating (as I am used to in a Chinatown and gives an indication of authenticity), but I do realize we're in Phoenix where the Asian population is not like San Francisco or Houston. \n\nThe meal came to about $30 for two, including jasmine tea. The carts are loud because they are made out of metal and roll on tile. I am also not used to staff members shouting what they have in their cart, like a newspaper boy yelling \"Extra! Extra!\" Christmas music was playing after mid-January, so the atmosphere felt strange. Next time I visit the city, I probably will pass.","Can't say that I was very impressed. Came for dinner in a hopeful and enthusiastic mood since the reviews have been pretty good, but I don't think this place lives up to its current good, but declining rating.\n\nOrdered the Combo fried rice (shrimp, chicken, beef, pork), sesame chicken, and garlic fried chicken. \n\nThe combo fried rice was pretty good, but ended up drinking about 6 glasses of water due to the MSG and sodium content. You'd think that the cook spent his better years in the French Foreign Legion in the Sahara eating salt tablets and developed a taste for them. \n\nThe sesame chicken had a good flavor and a thick brown sweet sauce. I liked it a lot until it got cool and the sauce looked (with that stringy consistency) more like glue. You think I'm kidding? I'm not.\n\nGarlic fried chicken was bad. Just bad. It was like an over roasted dried out half chicken with some dried garlic pieces sprinkled on top. No spices, no flavor, no good. \n\nWe then got all kinds of lip from the waitress when we asked if they could change the channel on the TV from college football, to the Suns game. They made it into this big deal that the \"customers\" wanted to see the football game. Yeah right, it was University of West Virginia Vs. University of Connecticut! I would have believed it if it was a local team....\n\nIt's better than a 1 star joint, but only because it's borderline edible. To be avoided.","This restaurant is located in the Chinese Cultural Center and was the one restaurant that I had not been to. So after some shopping at one of the shops, we stepped in to have dinner.\n\nWe stepped in and asked for a seat for two. We were seated immediately. The place was decorated nicely and a lady playing the piano made for great ambiance.\n\nWe looked at the menu briefly and ordered our drinks, an appetizer, a soup and two main dishes. The drinks came out promptly and so did the rest of the meal. My goodness everything we ordered was very tasty.\n\nThe waiter service itself however was not even close to the decor and food. He never introduced himself, and although he took our order, our food itself was brought out by a kitchen person.\n\nAfter we ordered our waiter really never came back asking if we needed anything else, except to give us our check at the end and that was after the person I was dining with got up and asked a different waiter for it.\n\nIt's amazing how a place with great food, decor, and ambiance can mess it all up by crappy waiter service.","I love Dim Sum, my favorite Chinese dish.\n\nWhen Golden Buddha first open, they have excellent Dim sum. I went there many times, I tell my friend how good it is, But now,  they change cook, taste more like  week old left over. Rumor has it, they change cook every few month, so Quality of cooking change. (not sure if that is true, but that is what I was told.)\nMy advice is; when you walk in the door and the place is pack, = Good Cook. if the place is bare = bad cook. leave immediately. don't waste your money.","If you just \"want\" dim sum, go here. If you are \"craving\" dim sum, go elsewhere (take a 5 hour drive west to neighboring state, California).\n\nAnyway, I've been visiting Golden Buddha in the noontime for roughly 2 years now. I believe they moved from their original site (7th St. & Osborn), formerly \"China Doll.\" Relocation brought along better atmosphere and smiling faces. This does not mean, better dim sum. But since we are in Phoenix, I will settle for what they have to offer. \n\nBe mindful of the dim sum tab. It's itemized high-medium-low. \n\nShaomai can be found as combinations of pork/mushroom, shrimp, or shark fin (which should not be confused as true shark bits, as the shaomai is prepared to look like a shark's fin). These picks are okay...perhaps on a better day shao mai will be served in less-rigid, or fresher wrappers. Potstickers are okay as well, just the usual scallion and pork, and dry wrapper. The baby pork ribs in light black bean sauce and jalapenos is alright, but sometimes lacks in taste. Tripe is also served in its bare minimum...so if you enjoy the texture and flavor of tripe, try this with its clear sauce and thinly sliced carrots and celery.  \nBuche (that's what I call it), or fried sesame balls are also available, although if you wait until dessert, they will also be a bit stiff. There are a few other things that may be \"spotted\" but are not worth mentioning. \n\nDon't order from their lunch menu, as you can find these over-salted dishes at Panda Express anyway. \n\nOverall, dim sum at Golden Buddha is a place to go if you are around the vicinity and feel like having something apart from the usual fast food. However, discriminating palates- beware.","Not impressed with this place at all. This was not the friendliest place around, maybe because of the language barrier (most or all were clearly native Chinese speakers), or maybe just the attitude of the employees.\n\nI ordered the sweet and sour chicken lunch, which came with the typical egg drop soup, crab rangoon, and egg roll. The soup was ok - maybe it's just me, but I prefer a real spoon to the scoop that they gave me. The egg roll was tiny and not that great, and the crab rangoon was ok, but maybe a little undercooked. The chicken wasn't bad, but nothing special, as was the rice and other stuff on the plate.\n\nOverall, this was just not my kind of Chinese place.","Disappointing.  Mediocre at best.  I am staying at the Aloft hotel in phoenix and ordered some delivery. I ordered a couple american chinese food staples: general tso's chicken, dumplings and hot&sour soup.  Soup had zero flavor, dumplings tasted freezer burned and processed.  General tso chicken was ehh. \n\nA lot of good reviews on here so it must be for eat in and for their dim sum.  Don't order delivery, you will be left hungry and unsatisfied.","Went there on Saturday for early lunch.  My wife did the dim sum, it was okay, we were both disgusted by the sugar cane shrimp; but the rest was good.  \n\nI ordered the chicken szechwuan, the waitress warned me it was \"spicy\" the reason I ordered it.  It came out delicious, but not what I would call spicy.  Overall its hard to find good Chinese in the valley and I would call this good without hesitation.","So I was referred to this place from the front desk of my hotel. I'm from SF so I'm coming from a place with really good chinese food. \n\nThe dim sum is just \"ok\" nothing for me to write home about. The one dish that I really liked was the chinese broccoli cooked with garlic sauce. Yum yum yum.  It's in a big bowl, not oily, not saucy, just really good. I think it's $7.50.  \n\nIt's a somewhat pricey and just like all chinese restaurants, it's not the cleanest.  The chair was filthy.  the dishes weren't all that great.  I wouldn't go back unless I want the chinese broccoli.  \n\nSo I went on a Sunday and it was not crowded at all. There's not a huge asian population  in Phoenix (not that I could tell) so I don't think there's a high demand for dim sum.  And also, I sooooooo felt like taking a pic of this, but a Mexican lady was pushing one of the dim sum carts. That is unheard of in SF.  This is a mainly mandarin restaurant and the dim sum places I go are usually cantonese.  Not a big deal though since the dishes look the same. \n\nDude, there was a turtle in the fish tank that I saw as I left.  I hope they don't eat that!","A Premier Chinese Atmosphere,\nThe Chinese cultural center and Asian Garden produces an Asain atmosphere that can be recognized from the 202.  \n With Dim Sum served this location earns its respect from the local community.\n\nDim Sum tip,  You have to be smart with the Dim Sum ladies they look nice innocent but they are professional sales people that will sell you more dishes than you need before you know what to do.  \n\nI love the desserts here ask the server to see the dessert tray.","This restaurant has a bit of an identity crisis. It is in the Chinese cultural center, but serves Japanese beer (Kirin on tap!) and the live piano music is American pop. We had to ask for chopsticks.\n\nHaving said that, the service was professional. Our waiter held a hot appetizer for one of our party who was away from the table so that it would not be cold when he returned. We were asked frequently--and not too frequently--if things were ok both by our waiter and the manager/proprietor.\n\nThe food was ok-to-good. Fried shrimp egg rolls were dainty but yummy. Duck was tasty but very chewy. Kung-pao chicken was pleasantly spiced. Plenty of rice. A pitcher of ice water with lemon was left at the table. \n\nAtmosphere was also pleasant. Chairs comfortable, tables spaced well, restrooms large and clean...and there is indeed a large golden Buddha by the entrance.","I took a group of friends here and relatives other times. The place is consistently good for Dim-sum during lunch. It is typical Chinese and nothing fancy.\n\nWhat helps this place is the moat scenery.  3 stars for visiting here based on convenience since there are similar places in town.","Having grown up in Hong Kong and having eaten dim sum in London, NY, LA, SF and Vancouver (actually Richmond), I can confidently say I know my dim sum.\n\nGood selection of well-executed dim sum when the carts actually come around and there's anything left in it.  I'd give it 4 stars for food but the wait definitely detracted from the whole experience.\n\nI think the problem with Golden Buddha is that they can't handle the heavy flow on weekends.  There's not enough regular dim sum eaters like LA that can sustain a steady flow of diners throughout the week, forcing restaurants like Golden Buddha to depend heavily on extra part-time help on weekends.  \n\nDim sum takes serious skill so the chef still ends up doing most of the work.  When we looked into the kitchen, we saw a Chinese woman doing most of the cooking herself.  No wonder it took forever for a cart to come out and when it does, it's swarmed on by a pack of vultures.\n\nIf you're willing to eat at a more simply decorated place with a smaller menu, I'd highly recommend China Chan.  It's much more relaxed - usually no wait on weekends.  An experienced chef makes all the dim sum himself so the menu's much shorter but all the classics are on it.  Anything steamed is made to order so is very fresh.","Situated in the Chinese Cultural Center near the SkyHarbor Airport, this was another pleasant find. All I had was the Dim Sum menu, and I would say this is the best you're gonna get in Phoenix. Still worth the stop to get your Dim Sum fix. The cart ladies were pleasant and very happy to converse with me in Cantonese. Only downside was the chicken sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaves, naw mei gai, was way overcooked, and mushy.","Do you want to eat Chinese Food in an elegant environment on a Friday night in Phoenix? \n\nBe entertained by classic, quiet standards being played live on a piano while you dine?\n\nAre you 50 years old and Caucasian?\n\nThen the Golden Buddha is the place for you! \n\nIts in the Chinese Cultural Center Mall on 44th, and a popular weekend spot for Dim Sum. For a DIm Sum starved Valley of the Sun, Golden Buddha's is decent. \n\nFor dinner, though, it is awfully Americanized and not very authentic Chinese. But with a bunch of American customers coming for dinner, what do you expect? They probably think they are getting \"real Chinese\" food by going to the Chinese Mall, but then again, they are used to PF Chang's or Stix normally in their neighborhood, so this is a step up.\n\nThe best thing about this place is the decor, which is clean and nice, with a Hong Kong Junk boat design covering the ceiling from the bar into the dining room. The next best thing is the Piano interludes on weekend nights. The service is next, which is a little overly eager to remove your plate, and the last thing is the food. \n\nThey do give decent portions. I ordered Guo Teh (potstickers) and got 6 fat ones. But they weren't served with the usual soy, chili oil and vinegar, but a soy and green onions mixture. The Mapo Tofu was ok, as they used a nice silky tofu, which was nice, but no green onions, and sliced black mushrooms instead, which I like, but not in this dish.\n\nCome here for the ambiance and music in the evenings, or on the weekend days for Dim Sum.","Decent dim sum, especially to be found in the middle of the desert. Sadly, the best food I've had in Phoenix.","This place is a little difficult for me to review.  I was staying at the Hampton Inn across the street and this is the closest restaurant so off I went.\n\nI walked in and the owner or manager met me at the door and asked \"how many\"?\n\nI told him I wanted to order take out and handed me a menu and pointed to the waiting area which was covered in newspapers.  I chose to go to the bar, order a glass of wine, and peruse the menu.\n\nThe drinks are expensive but I didn't think the food was.  Less than $10 for my Mongolian Chicken which came with white sticky rice and a fortune cookie.  When ordering I asked if I could have fried rice instead of white rice but was told \"no\".  Most places allow this for a nominal fee.\n\nFine by me.  Give the white rice.  Food was prepared and their to-go boxes were a lot better than the standard white Chinese \"to go\" boxes.  They also included the plastic-ware, napkin, and soy sauce, which a lot of places forget.\n\nLooking around I found a whole lot of goodness along with a couple disappointments.  Most notably the newspaper strewn about and behind the bar, to the right were a lot of boxes stacked in an unsightly fashion.  I could have been a little more presentable in my opinion.\n\nI peeked into the dining room because I wanted to see if the piano music was piped in or live.  It was live which was very nice. Also, the dinning room looked very nice and cozy.\n\nAs I was leaving the same man who greeted me upon entering made sure to wish me a good evening.  My initial impression of the man was that he was surly and testy but that's just how he comes off.\n\nThe food was very good.  The Mongolian sauce was mixture of sweet with spice and the chicken and vegetables all tasted fresh.","My husband and I went there Saturday, the service was great!  Our friends were going to be late so they told us to start.  And start we did!\nThey were serving Dim Sum, something we had never tried, so glad we did, it was wonderful, hubby wouldn't do the chicken feet, but I think next time I will, it looked very good.\nOur friends showed up and ordered their food, and ate all of it, they said that usually they take food home, but it was so good they had to eat all of it!\nWe will be going back very soon!","Let's see, over 50... check \nold white man...........check \neats dinner ...............check \nlistens to the piano  check \n\nwow this must be the place for me, I mean after all it is in a Chinese mall, no make that a Chinese Cultural Center. How could I possibly have discerning taste with such trickery to get me here to eat. \nDude if you are going to rate a restaurant no need to degrade others with your arrogance. \nFool is my review of wanugee N. \n\nNow on the restaurant. The last time we were here the food was not good, the piano was too loud and the waitress had a real attitude. IT won't keep me from going back as I have had good meals and wait service too. \n\nBack to wanugee N. I do not expect any place in Phx. to have authentic Chinese food, by that I mean the street food one finds in China. \nBut I do expect what I fork in to my mouth is worth what I am going to fork over in cost. Even an old white guy like me can tell the difference between good and bad food. No matter what it is called.","Okay so Ive been glum the past few days as I have an impending birthday. Every year this time I get all down in the dumps.. not that I'm not happy with my life cause life is good. Its more like getting further away from my youth and closer to being well, old. All of my grandparents were crotchety, sourpuss drama queens.. is that my fate? Can I break the mold or am I to going to be a crotchety sourpuss?\n\nSo as I contemplate and figure out what I'm going to do with my birthday baggage I decide to squash it with food. All weekend Ive been eating out and having a good time. This is one of the few times outside of a vacation where I will live it completely and to the near of sheer gluttony. So why not dim sum? \n\nIve chowed much dim sum in my 36 years of earthen wear.. of course some good and some bad. I have never been to a place where every dish was great.. Golden Buddha is no exception to this.. they do the basics well enough and have enough funky cool Asian style to keep me interested in returning. The carts around 1130 flow well but around noon it' s full blown freeway action! In fact there might be some road kill in there based on some of the looks on that last steam cart.. \n\nMe and 3 others who were feeling my pain ordered 14, count them, 14 different dishes. One of my friends is from Georgia and had never had dim sum but he is so courageous and unflinching that he was just a blast. Just the shot in the arm to get me out of my funk. I remember the first time I had dim sum.. my eyes wide open, nostrils flared and excited to see what was under the next steamer lid. That was him today.. one exciting thing after the next.. he was even willing to try chicken feet but this is one of those dishes not done very well here. \n\nMy friend took me back to a time where I was younger and less experienced. He looked up to me to guide him through the noodles, bao and sui mai.. like a big brother.. I'm privileged that I could show him something new and exciting and he was so into it! So instead of feeling sorry for myself I felt experienced and useful.. that there is something I can give back to others.. that its not all about me and me aging but about what can be shared with others.\n\nThere is so much more to do, give and feel in this short time we are here.. and Ill do it to, one bite at a time.","The best to be found in land locked Arizona.  My favorite sticky rice is here.  They have dim sum every day, but not a huge selection, though you can order off the menu.  I think it is much bigger on the weekends.  I'm just happy I can get my fix 7 days a week.  Beautiful gardens to walk through, with fish ponds, and a 99 market next door!","I ate at Golden Buddha a few weeks ago.  We ate at the restaurant after a day at the zoo with our 4 year old and had a blast.  The piano bar played tunes for my daughter and the staff was more than accommodating.  The general tso chicken was better than anything I can get in Tucson.  The soup was chocked full of fresh, read FRESH, not canned, vegetables.  All in all, I was very satisfied with the meal and the service.  Plus the decor is very nice, clean and cheery. \n\nEat at Golden Buddha.","For those who gave this place low marks, forgive me. I really like this place. Now I haven't tried various dim sum places so I'm reserving the right to downgrade the place as needed. The variety of food is plentiful, and the carts just keep on coming. I love the steamed pork buns, and the shiu mai (not sure if I spelled that correctly). Yesterday, my favorite pick was the deep fried rolls of taro and shrimp. YUM! I have never ordered from their menu so I can only talk about their dim sum. My friends and I try to go eat dim sum almost every Sunday. It's a cheap way to try new foods, and if you don't like it, well.. you can get away with pushing it aside with minimal guilt. Give it a try! You might be surprised.","I like Golden Buddha, have taken many friends there for Dim Sum.  \nTry not to \"hit\" the dumpling cart to heavy; otherwise cannot finish it to the dessert cart (LOL).\nLove the jasmine tea and the staff willing to help you if you do not understand the what each item is.\nSingapore Rice Noodles a favorite, along with any of the shrimp dumplings; also the broccoli and green beans.\nOnly wish that the carts with eggplant stuffed with shrimp or green peppers with shrimp were not on \"heated\" carts; by the time it gets to you the food is cold.\nOnly concern is that went on 22MAY2010 at 1:30PM; there was a closed sign due to electricity???\nREVISED: 26MAY2010 - called this evening - looks like they are back open again.","I've been to the Golden Buddha on several occasions and it is my favorite, by far, for honest Chinese food. \nWhile I've sampled everything from their vegetarian to their beef, I love their mandarin chicken. More recently, I was delighted to relive the wonders of their Kung Pao Chicken and Beef with Broccoli. \nI absolutely love the egg drop soup and mini crab rangoons that come with the meal.","The very first time I went to Golden Buddha was with my BFF and it was our first dim sum experience. Little did I know this would forever change my life and eating experiences. Although I must admit that first time was a bit awkward.\n\nGB wisely takes reservations which was wonderful (even though it wasn't crazy busy). Our assorted dim sum plates were flavorful and fresh. And the carts seemed to be in constant rotation so we were never too far from a good selection.\n\nWhat really helps GB is its location. The Cofco Center is an experience in itself, where one can have herbs specially blended, select a fresh member of marine life to take home and cook or browse through a store with one of the largest selections of Buddhas and hand fans I've experienced outside of San Francisco.","I've been to Golden Buddha a few times and have not been disappointed. \n\nThey have a LARGE selection of Dim Sum and if you're not careful you can get carried away.\n\nTry and get there early and you'll get the best and most fresh selection.\nMake sure you walk around the garden when you're done.","Probably the most comprehensive Chinese menu in the Valley.  Pick from well over 100 dishes, but if you want the best order the Peking Duck.  Everything else is very good, but without a wow factor.  You'll see lots of Chinese people in this massive restaurant, which probably means they're doing a fine job in the kitchen.","I very much enjoyed eating here. Food was great. Fairly fast service. Wasn't expensive either for the 4 of us.","Golden Buddha has GREAT dim sum.  Their prices are reasonable and the staff is very polite wheeling their little carts.  I tend to go on the weekend because there is more selection but they do dim sum throughout the week.  They also have some very authentic dishes on the menu for those who are more of the adventurous types.  Be sure to say hello to the turtles the next time you go.","This place in the Chinese Cultural Center has a very pretty and elegant bar area. I was pleased to learn that they had some very reasonable and delicious happy hour snacks. This is a good place for a Pina Colada. I had one by myself along with some dumplings and fried shrimp appetizer. Sadly I never brought anyone else here with me. It was happy hour heaven but you know? A lot of my friends in AZ pretty much hang out in one neighborhood or another and nobody I know really lives close to the Buddha.\nThe airport is pretty close by. This might be a good pre-flight send-off location.","I have had dim sum in New Orleans and Phoenix (not SF), and this is about equal to the best of New Orleans as far as flavor.\nAs for ambiance, today was a good day. I've had dim sum here about a dozen times, and have had very good service and quality 90% of the time, including weekends. I have had bad days here, but since today was good, I'll rate accordingly. It's closer to a 4.5, but since I can't give half-stars, I rounded up.\nDon't expect me to give these the right names, but... I was less than impressed with the bbq pork balls. They tasted too much like honey and the beef was minimal. The bbq sauce tasted bottled. Outside of that, their herbal hot tea is delicious even on a hot day.\nThe shu mai were very good, and the shrimp in a spinach dumpling was fantastic. A definite don't miss is their sticky rice in lotus leaf. It's among the best I've had anywhere. Just be careful; you'll find bones in it every once in a while. Go for any of their steamed dumplings; they're very flavorful. As others have said, I love the Chinese broccoli, but you'll only find it on the carts on weekends. Otherwise order it off the menu.\nToday (11:30 lunch) the carts came around often, and everything except the pork buns was piping hot and fresh. By the way, despite the price increases, even the sticky rice was considered a medium size entree, and the two of us eating there escaped with a bill under $20 and we were done in under 30 minutes.\nI strongly recommend the dim sum here, whether you've had it a million times or have never had it before. You usually won't be disappointed.","I don't really understand the poor reviews on this place.....maybe it depends on the day you go? We went on a Sunday, it was crazy busy, but service was great! (of course, my view of customer service is a little different then the rest... I used to live on an island where you were just happy to find what you were looking for, let alone expect good customer service) Anyways, our server was very sweet! Always had a smile on her face. The carts served us promplty and none of the food was cold. They always had whatever we wanted (I hate having to wait for the next cart).\n\nNow, as for the actual dim sum and food.......holy cow, to die for! So flavorful and fresh!! The broccoli makes you sing...and the wine noodles, make you cry. You leave with very weird mixed emotions, but mostly a happy belly full of yummy food.\n\nIn my opinion, this is the best dim sum I have been able to find in Phx. I'm ditching my previous spot (Mekong Palace) and will be back to Golden Buddha when the dim sum monster strikes again!"],"type":["Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low

waiter was to be found about ten minutes later they gave us our water and left again! It wasn't even busy! There were only TWO dim sum carts floating around somewhere. Then our waiter finally came around and took our orders of lunch entrees. The food was not even that good as the reviews that are posted on here. When we came up to pay, the bill was super overpriced. I will not be returning here, I am better off eating at Great Wall Cuisine.","If this place had zero stars I would have given them that ! Let me start off by saying I was so excited to read all great reviews so maybe I just came in on a off day? We walked in and were seated came over and asked if we wanted water or tea I guess they don't serve anything Else, Then we placed an order pork dumplings and sticky rice nasty! Then I asked if they served egg rolls they said they were out!!! they pushed their little carts around with hot plates that basically steam the food and is not fresh and what you get is soggy poor customer service we had to get up and look for someone to give us our tab so we could get the heck out of there are get some real food. It looked like it would be a great place for groups of people would not recommend if you are on mission for what you want and want to place an order but it could be a fun experience for some people.","You walk into a Chinese restaurant on a Saturday afternoon for dim sum and you expect the place to be PACKED.  Well, walking in to a pretty much empty dining room, it's a VERY CLEAR SIGN.  But my friend insisted and I was very hesitant for good reasons.  Another indicator, the majority of the patrons were NON Asian.  \n\nFood: You walk in and you see carts of the food by the entrance to the dining room.  Umm, I thought dim sum should come right off the steamer and into the carts and they roll it around, not sitting around.  The dim sum was garbage.  It had the typical selection, but at minimum.  \n\nService: It's ok.  But it doesn't make up for the horrible food.\n\nBottom line: NO WAY!  Stay away!","I've been here many times...Mother's Day with family, dim sum with book club, etc. But I will not go back again.  I stopped in to ask the owner about a donation or reduced price for a class of under-privileged kids that I volunteer with.  His reaction was to scoff and shoo me out the door while handing me his card and saying I could email him.  He turned his back and headed off to the messy newspaper-strewn table he haunts between guests arrivals.  Maybe he's a community-minded business owner, but then again, maybe he's not.  I'll be dining elsewhere.","Being from Chicago, we are used to getting authentic Chinese food all the time.  But when we first starting spending a lot of time in Scottsdale/Phoenix, we found it a challenge to get authentic Chinese food.  We were excited to find the Golden Buddha and have made many trips over the years all the way from the Troon North area to get our fix.  However, service has declined to the point where it is no longer worth the aggravation.  We went there last night for Chinese New Year and will never go back.  Granted they were very busy because of a lot of large tables there, but waiting almost an hour to get our food is not acceptable under any circumstance!  45 mins. into our wait, the waitress came back (after we flagged her down to ask about our food) and said one of the dishes we ordered was not available....after 45 mins.!!!! What makes the whole experience an unforgivable one is that the manager/owner is so indifferent and never apologized or offered a discount off the bill...nothing.  When we left, the same manager was at the piano singing in Chinese. Huh?  Other than Nee House in Scottsdale, the search goes on for a restaurant that serves authentic Chinese food closer to home.","I will NEVER go there again.  I reserved a table for a group of 16 people for 5:00 PM on Christmas Eve .  The person on the phone ( I believe the manager) repeatedly asked me to call ahead and give him an accurate head count since he said they'd be swamped that day.  I followed up with him twice.  \nWhen the first couple of us arrived, we had menus shoved in our faces immediately and told we \"Must order now.  Must order now\" because they were going to be busy later on.  The place was practically empty.  As each person arrived, they were treated the same way. \nWe rushed and placed our orders and then they brought out our checks WAY before we saw any sign of our food.  I have never in my life been treated so rudely by a restaurant.\nIt was utter chaos when the food started coming out while everyone struggled to get the correct dish they ordered.  One person didn't get her food until we were all just about finished eating. \nOne top of all that, the food wasn't even good.  I've had better Kung Pao Chicken at Panda Express!\nAfter being rushed through our meal, the place wasn't even half full by the time we left.  I thought being at the Cultural Center, this restaurant would be a sure thing but boy was I wrong.  Lovely way to spend Christmas Eve..","If you are looking a chinese restaurant to host a big party look some other than the Golden Buddah.  I recently attended a banquet at the Golden Buddah and I was shocked at the level of quality of food and service.  Of the 10 dishes served 4 were nearly inedible.  \n\nThere was a crab claw appetizer, most chinese restaurants prepare this dish by taking a crab claw surrounding it with ground shrimp, batter and then deep fry.  At Golden Buddah, the crab claw served was mostly batter.  \n\nThe shark fin soup served was mostly broth.  Shark fin is an expensive ingredient and most places usually use imitation shark fin, but come on at least put something in there so that I know I'm eating soup and not dirty sink water.  \n\nGinger scallion lobster is battered, fried, and then stir fried in a sauce with ginger and scallions.  The ginger scallion lobster served was over-cooked and dried out.  \n\nLastly, there was a steamed fish.  The fish was raw in the middle.   \n\nIt wasn't all bad, there was a crispy chicken with garlic dish that was pretty good, but out of 10 dishes 4 were bad, 5 were okay, and 1 was good.  \n\nDoes 4 bad dishes out of 10 warrant a one star rating?  Well it does when you factor in the service.  The soup, appetizer, and first entree arrived timely, but after that there was a 1 hour gap before we received the next dish.  The dishes were not served with accompanying white rice which I thought was odd.  We had to ask for it, and even the rice took a while to arrive.","I agree with Crystal C., that the dim sum isn't the greatest I've ever had. In fact, I am not sure if the meal was so tasty that it was memorable. I do remember the \"calamari\" was not really calamari, like you would think. It was presented more like a sweet and sour pork (so calamari with LOTS of breading) without any sauce. As a result, the dish was dry and salty.\n\nThe sticky rice was good (hard to mess up), the chicken feet were okay (needed more five spice powder), and the shumai was alright. The noodles were good, and I can see why the cart ran out after the first round. The diners were an equal mix of Asians and Americans. I would've preferred to see more Asians eating (as I am used to in a Chinatown and gives an indication of authenticity), but I do realize we're in Phoenix where the Asian population is not like San Francisco or Houston. \n\nThe meal came to about $30 for two, including jasmine tea. The carts are loud because they are made out of metal and roll on tile. I am also not used to staff members shouting what they have in their cart, like a newspaper boy yelling \"Extra! Extra!\" Christmas music was playing after mid-January, so the atmosphere felt strange. Next time I visit the city, I probably will pass.","Can't say that I was very impressed. Came for dinner in a hopeful and enthusiastic mood since the reviews have been pretty good, but I don't think this place lives up to its current good, but declining rating.\n\nOrdered the Combo fried rice (shrimp, chicken, beef, pork), sesame chicken, and garlic fried chicken. \n\nThe combo fried rice was pretty good, but ended up drinking about 6 glasses of water due to the MSG and sodium content. You'd think that the cook spent his better years in the French Foreign Legion in the Sahara eating salt tablets and developed a taste for them. \n\nThe sesame chicken had a good flavor and a thick brown sweet sauce. I liked it a lot until it got cool and the sauce looked (with that stringy consistency) more like glue. You think I'm kidding? I'm not.\n\nGarlic fried chicken was bad. Just bad. It was like an over roasted dried out half chicken with some dried garlic pieces sprinkled on top. No spices, no flavor, no good. \n\nWe then got all kinds of lip from the waitress when we asked if they could change the channel on the TV from college football, to the Suns game. They made it into this big deal that the \"customers\" wanted to see the football game. Yeah right, it was University of West Virginia Vs. University of Connecticut! I would have believed it if it was a local team....\n\nIt's better than a 1 star joint, but only because it's borderline edible. To be avoided.","This restaurant is located in the Chinese Cultural Center and was the one restaurant that I had not been to. So after some shopping at one of the shops, we stepped in to have dinner.\n\nWe stepped in and asked for a seat for two. We were seated immediately. The place was decorated nicely and a lady playing the piano made for great ambiance.\n\nWe looked at the menu briefly and ordered our drinks, an appetizer, a soup and two main dishes. The drinks came out promptly and so did the rest of the meal. My goodness everything we ordered was very tasty.\n\nThe waiter service itself however was not even close to the decor and food. He never introduced himself, and although he took our order, our food itself was brought out by a kitchen person.\n\nAfter we ordered our waiter really never came back asking if we needed anything else, except to give us our check at the end and that was after the person I was dining with got up and asked a different waiter for it.\n\nIt's amazing how a place with great food, decor, and ambiance can mess it all up by crappy waiter service.","I love Dim Sum, my favorite Chinese dish.\n\nWhen Golden Buddha first open, they have excellent Dim sum. I went there many times, I tell my friend how good it is, But now,  they change cook, taste more like  week old left over. Rumor has it, they change cook every few month, so Quality of cooking change. (not sure if that is true, but that is what I was told.)\nMy advice is; when you walk in the door and the place is pack, = Good Cook. if the place is bare = bad cook. leave immediately. don't waste your money.","If you just \"want\" dim sum, go here. If you are \"craving\" dim sum, go elsewhere (take a 5 hour drive west to neighboring state, California).\n\nAnyway, I've been visiting Golden Buddha in the noontime for roughly 2 years now. I believe they moved from their original site (7th St. & Osborn), formerly \"China Doll.\" Relocation brought along better atmosphere and smiling faces. This does not mean, better dim sum. But since we are in Phoenix, I will settle for what they have to offer. \n\nBe mindful of the dim sum tab. It's itemized high-medium-low. \n\nShaomai can be found as combinations of pork/mushroom, shrimp, or shark fin (which should not be confused as true shark bits, as the shaomai is prepared to look like a shark's fin). These picks are okay...perhaps on a better day shao mai will be served in less-rigid, or fresher wrappers. Potstickers are okay as well, just the usual scallion and pork, and dry wrapper. The baby pork ribs in light black bean sauce and jalapenos is alright, but sometimes lacks in taste. Tripe is also served in its bare minimum...so if you enjoy the texture and flavor of tripe, try this with its clear sauce and thinly sliced carrots and celery.  \nBuche (that's what I call it), or fried sesame balls are also available, although if you wait until dessert, they will also be a bit stiff. There are a few other things that may be \"spotted\" but are not worth mentioning. \n\nDon't order from their lunch menu, as you can find these over-salted dishes at Panda Express anyway. \n\nOverall, dim sum at Golden Buddha is a place to go if you are around the vicinity and feel like having something apart from the usual fast food. However, discriminating palates- beware.","Not impressed with this place at all. This was not the friendliest place around, maybe because of the language barrier (most or all were clearly native Chinese speakers), or maybe just the attitude of the employees.\n\nI ordered the sweet and sour chicken lunch, which came with the typical egg drop soup, crab rangoon, and egg roll. The soup was ok - maybe it's just me, but I prefer a real spoon to the scoop that they gave me. The egg roll was tiny and not that great, and the crab rangoon was ok, but maybe a little undercooked. The chicken wasn't bad, but nothing special, as was the rice and other stuff on the plate.\n\nOverall, this was just not my kind of Chinese place.","Disappointing.  Mediocre at best.  I am staying at the Aloft hotel in phoenix and ordered some delivery. I ordered a couple american chinese food staples: general tso's chicken, dumplings and hot&sour soup.  Soup had zero flavor, dumplings tasted freezer burned and processed.  General tso chicken was ehh. \n\nA lot of good reviews on here so it must be for eat in and for their dim sum.  Don't order delivery, you will be left hungry and unsatisfied.","Went there on Saturday for early lunch.  My wife did the dim sum, it was okay, we were both disgusted by the sugar cane shrimp; but the rest was good.  \n\nI ordered the chicken szechwuan, the waitress warned me it was \"spicy\" the reason I ordered it.  It came out delicious, but not what I would call spicy.  Overall its hard to find good Chinese in the valley and I would call this good without hesitation.","So I was referred to this place from the front desk of my hotel. I'm from SF so I'm coming from a place with really good chinese food. \n\nThe dim sum is just \"ok\" nothing for me to write home about. The one dish that I really liked was the chinese broccoli cooked with garlic sauce. Yum yum yum.  It's in a big bowl, not oily, not saucy, just really good. I think it's $7.50.  \n\nIt's a somewhat pricey and just like all chinese restaurants, it's not the cleanest.  The chair was filthy.  the dishes weren't all that great.  I wouldn't go back unless I want the chinese broccoli.  \n\nSo I went on a Sunday and it was not crowded at all. There's not a huge asian population  in Phoenix (not that I could tell) so I don't think there's a high demand for dim sum.  And also, I sooooooo felt like taking a pic of this, but a Mexican lady was pushing one of the dim sum carts. That is unheard of in SF.  This is a mainly mandarin restaurant and the dim sum places I go are usually cantonese.  Not a big deal though since the dishes look the same. \n\nDude, there was a turtle in the fish tank that I saw as I left.  I hope they don't eat that!","A Premier Chinese Atmosphere,\nThe Chinese cultural center and Asian Garden produces an Asain atmosphere that can be recognized from the 202.  \n With Dim Sum served this location earns its respect from the local community.\n\nDim Sum tip,  You have to be smart with the Dim Sum ladies they look nice innocent but they are professional sales people that will sell you more dishes than you need before you know what to do.  \n\nI love the desserts here ask the server to see the dessert tray.","This restaurant has a bit of an identity crisis. It is in the Chinese cultural center, but serves Japanese beer (Kirin on tap!) and the live piano music is American pop. We had to ask for chopsticks.\n\nHaving said that, the service was professional. Our waiter held a hot appetizer for one of our party who was away from the table so that it would not be cold when he returned. We were asked frequently--and not too frequently--if things were ok both by our waiter and the manager/proprietor.\n\nThe food was ok-to-good. Fried shrimp egg rolls were dainty but yummy. Duck was tasty but very chewy. Kung-pao chicken was pleasantly spiced. Plenty of rice. A pitcher of ice water with lemon was left at the table. \n\nAtmosphere was also pleasant. Chairs comfortable, tables spaced well, restrooms large and clean...and there is indeed a large golden Buddha by the entrance.","I took a group of friends here and relatives other times. The place is consistently good for Dim-sum during lunch. It is typical Chinese and nothing fancy.\n\nWhat helps this place is the moat scenery.  3 stars for visiting here based on convenience since there are similar places in town.","Having grown up in Hong Kong and having eaten dim sum in London, NY, LA, SF and Vancouver (actually Richmond), I can confidently say I know my dim sum.\n\nGood selection of well-executed dim sum when the carts actually come around and there's anything left in it.  I'd give it 4 stars for food but the wait definitely detracted from the whole experience.\n\nI think the problem with Golden Buddha is that they can't handle the heavy flow on weekends.  There's not enough regular dim sum eaters like LA that can sustain a steady flow of diners throughout the week, forcing restaurants like Golden Buddha to depend heavily on extra part-time help on weekends.  \n\nDim sum takes serious skill so the chef still ends up doing most of the work.  When we looked into the kitchen, we saw a Chinese woman doing most of the cooking herself.  No wonder it took forever for a cart to come out and when it does, it's swarmed on by a pack of vultures.\n\nIf you're willing to eat at a more simply decorated place with a smaller menu, I'd highly recommend China Chan.  It's much more relaxed - usually no wait on weekends.  An experienced chef makes all the dim sum himself so the menu's much shorter but all the classics are on it.  Anything steamed is made to order so is very fresh.","Situated in the Chinese Cultural Center near the SkyHarbor Airport, this was another pleasant find. All I had was the Dim Sum menu, and I would say this is the best you're gonna get in Phoenix. Still worth the stop to get your Dim Sum fix. The cart ladies were pleasant and very happy to converse with me in Cantonese. Only downside was the chicken sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaves, naw mei gai, was way overcooked, and mushy.","Do you want to eat Chinese Food in an elegant environment on a Friday night in Phoenix? \n\nBe entertained by classic, quiet standards being played live on a piano while you dine?\n\nAre you 50 years old and Caucasian?\n\nThen the Golden Buddha is the place for you! \n\nIts in the Chinese Cultural Center Mall on 44th, and a popular weekend spot for Dim Sum. For a DIm Sum starved Valley of the Sun, Golden Buddha's is decent. \n\nFor dinner, though, it is awfully Americanized and not very authentic Chinese. But with a bunch of American customers coming for dinner, what do you expect? They probably think they are getting \"real Chinese\" food by going to the Chinese Mall, but then again, they are used to PF Chang's or Stix normally in their neighborhood, so this is a step up.\n\nThe best thing about this place is the decor, which is clean and nice, with a Hong Kong Junk boat design covering the ceiling from the bar into the dining room. The next best thing is the Piano interludes on weekend nights. The service is next, which is a little overly eager to remove your plate, and the last thing is the food. \n\nThey do give decent portions. I ordered Guo Teh (potstickers) and got 6 fat ones. But they weren't served with the usual soy, chili oil and vinegar, but a soy and green onions mixture. The Mapo Tofu was ok, as they used a nice silky tofu, which was nice, but no green onions, and sliced black mushrooms instead, which I like, but not in this dish.\n\nCome here for the ambiance and music in the evenings, or on the weekend days for Dim Sum.","Decent dim sum, especially to be found in the middle of the desert. Sadly, the best food I've had in Phoenix.","This place is a little difficult for me to review.  I was staying at the Hampton Inn across the street and this is the closest restaurant so off I went.\n\nI walked in and the owner or manager met me at the door and asked \"how many\"?\n\nI told him I wanted to order take out and handed me a menu and pointed to the waiting area which was covered in newspapers.  I chose to go to the bar, order a glass of wine, and peruse the menu.\n\nThe drinks are expensive but I didn't think the food was.  Less than $10 for my Mongolian Chicken which came with white sticky rice and a fortune cookie.  When ordering I asked if I could have fried rice instead of white rice but was told \"no\".  Most places allow this for a nominal fee.\n\nFine by me.  Give the white rice.  Food was prepared and their to-go boxes were a lot better than the standard white Chinese \"to go\" boxes.  They also included the plastic-ware, napkin, and soy sauce, which a lot of places forget.\n\nLooking around I found a whole lot of goodness along with a couple disappointments.  Most notably the newspaper strewn about and behind the bar, to the right were a lot of boxes stacked in an unsightly fashion.  I could have been a little more presentable in my opinion.\n\nI peeked into the dining room because I wanted to see if the piano music was piped in or live.  It was live which was very nice. Also, the dinning room looked very nice and cozy.\n\nAs I was leaving the same man who greeted me upon entering made sure to wish me a good evening.  My initial impression of the man was that he was surly and testy but that's just how he comes off.\n\nThe food was very good.  The Mongolian sauce was mixture of sweet with spice and the chicken and vegetables all tasted fresh.","My husband and I went there Saturday, the service was great!  Our friends were going to be late so they told us to start.  And start we did!\nThey were serving Dim Sum, something we had never tried, so glad we did, it was wonderful, hubby wouldn't do the chicken feet, but I think next time I will, it looked very good.\nOur friends showed up and ordered their food, and ate all of it, they said that usually they take food home, but it was so good they had to eat all of it!\nWe will be going back very soon!","Let's see, over 50... check \nold white man...........check \neats dinner ...............check \nlistens to the piano  check \n\nwow this must be the place for me, I mean after all it is in a Chinese mall, no make that a Chinese Cultural Center. How could I possibly have discerning taste with such trickery to get me here to eat. \nDude if you are going to rate a restaurant no need to degrade others with your arrogance. \nFool is my review of wanugee N. \n\nNow on the restaurant. The last time we were here the food was not good, the piano was too loud and the waitress had a real attitude. IT won't keep me from going back as I have had good meals and wait service too. \n\nBack to wanugee N. I do not expect any place in Phx. to have authentic Chinese food, by that I mean the street food one finds in China. \nBut I do expect what I fork in to my mouth is worth what I am going to fork over in cost. Even an old white guy like me can tell the difference between good and bad food. No matter what it is called.","Okay so Ive been glum the past few days as I have an impending birthday. Every year this time I get all down in the dumps.. not that I'm not happy with my life cause life is good. Its more like getting further away from my youth and closer to being well, old. All of my grandparents were crotchety, sourpuss drama queens.. is that my fate? Can I break the mold or am I to going to be a crotchety sourpuss?\n\nSo as I contemplate and figure out what I'm going to do with my birthday baggage I decide to squash it with food. All weekend Ive been eating out and having a good time. This is one of the few times outside of a vacation where I will live it completely and to the near of sheer gluttony. So why not dim sum? \n\nIve chowed much dim sum in my 36 years of earthen wear.. of course some good and some bad. I have never been to a place where every dish was great.. Golden Buddha is no exception to this.. they do the basics well enough and have enough funky cool Asian style to keep me interested in returning. The carts around 1130 flow well but around noon it' s full blown freeway action! In fact there might be some road kill in there based on some of the looks on that last steam cart.. \n\nMe and 3 others who were feeling my pain ordered 14, count them, 14 different dishes. One of my friends is from Georgia and had never had dim sum but he is so courageous and unflinching that he was just a blast. Just the shot in the arm to get me out of my funk. I remember the first time I had dim sum.. my eyes wide open, nostrils flared and excited to see what was under the next steamer lid. That was him today.. one exciting thing after the next.. he was even willing to try chicken feet but this is one of those dishes not done very well here. \n\nMy friend took me back to a time where I was younger and less experienced. He looked up to me to guide him through the noodles, bao and sui mai.. like a big brother.. I'm privileged that I could show him something new and exciting and he was so into it! So instead of feeling sorry for myself I felt experienced and useful.. that there is something I can give back to others.. that its not all about me and me aging but about what can be shared with others.\n\nThere is so much more to do, give and feel in this short time we are here.. and Ill do it to, one bite at a time.","The best to be found in land locked Arizona.  My favorite sticky rice is here.  They have dim sum every day, but not a huge selection, though you can order off the menu.  I think it is much bigger on the weekends.  I'm just happy I can get my fix 7 days a week.  Beautiful gardens to walk through, with fish ponds, and a 99 market next door!","I ate at Golden Buddha a few weeks ago.  We ate at the restaurant after a day at the zoo with our 4 year old and had a blast.  The piano bar played tunes for my daughter and the staff was more than accommodating.  The general tso chicken was better than anything I can get in Tucson.  The soup was chocked full of fresh, read FRESH, not canned, vegetables.  All in all, I was very satisfied with the meal and the service.  Plus the decor is very nice, clean and cheery. \n\nEat at Golden Buddha.","For those who gave this place low marks, forgive me. I really like this place. Now I haven't tried various dim sum places so I'm reserving the right to downgrade the place as needed. The variety of food is plentiful, and the carts just keep on coming. I love the steamed pork buns, and the shiu mai (not sure if I spelled that correctly). Yesterday, my favorite pick was the deep fried rolls of taro and shrimp. YUM! I have never ordered from their menu so I can only talk about their dim sum. My friends and I try to go eat dim sum almost every Sunday. It's a cheap way to try new foods, and if you don't like it, well.. you can get away with pushing it aside with minimal guilt. Give it a try! You might be surprised.","I like Golden Buddha, have taken many friends there for Dim Sum.  \nTry not to \"hit\" the dumpling cart to heavy; otherwise cannot finish it to the dessert cart (LOL).\nLove the jasmine tea and the staff willing to help you if you do not understand the what each item is.\nSingapore Rice Noodles a favorite, along with any of the shrimp dumplings; also the broccoli and green beans.\nOnly wish that the carts with eggplant stuffed with shrimp or green peppers with shrimp were not on \"heated\" carts; by the time it gets to you the food is cold.\nOnly concern is that went on 22MAY2010 at 1:30PM; there was a closed sign due to electricity???\nREVISED: 26MAY2010 - called this evening - looks like they are back open again.","I've been to the Golden Buddha on several occasions and it is my favorite, by far, for honest Chinese food. \nWhile I've sampled everything from their vegetarian to their beef, I love their mandarin chicken. More recently, I was delighted to relive the wonders of their Kung Pao Chicken and Beef with Broccoli. \nI absolutely love the egg drop soup and mini crab rangoons that come with the meal.","The very first time I went to Golden Buddha was with my BFF and it was our first dim sum experience. Little did I know this would forever change my life and eating experiences. Although I must admit that first time was a bit awkward.\n\nGB wisely takes reservations which was wonderful (even though it wasn't crazy busy). Our assorted dim sum plates were flavorful and fresh. And the carts seemed to be in constant rotation so we were never too far from a good selection.\n\nWhat really helps GB is its location. The Cofco Center is an experience in itself, where one can have herbs specially blended, select a fresh member of marine life to take home and cook or browse through a store with one of the largest selections of Buddhas and hand fans I've experienced outside of San Francisco.","I've been to Golden Buddha a few times and have not been disappointed. \n\nThey have a LARGE selection of Dim Sum and if you're not careful you can get carried away.\n\nTry and get there early and you'll get the best and most fresh selection.\nMake sure you walk around the garden when you're done.","Probably the most comprehensive Chinese menu in the Valley.  Pick from well over 100 dishes, but if you want the best order the Peking Duck.  Everything else is very good, but without a wow factor.  You'll see lots of Chinese people in this massive restaurant, which probably means they're doing a fine job in the kitchen.","I very much enjoyed eating here. Food was great. Fairly fast service. Wasn't expensive either for the 4 of us.","Golden Buddha has GREAT dim sum.  Their prices are reasonable and the staff is very polite wheeling their little carts.  I tend to go on the weekend because there is more selection but they do dim sum throughout the week.  They also have some very authentic dishes on the menu for those who are more of the adventurous types.  Be sure to say hello to the turtles the next time you go.","This place in the Chinese Cultural Center has a very pretty and elegant bar area. I was pleased to learn that they had some very reasonable and delicious happy hour snacks. This is a good place for a Pina Colada. I had one by myself along with some dumplings and fried shrimp appetizer. Sadly I never brought anyone else here with me. It was happy hour heaven but you know? A lot of my friends in AZ pretty much hang out in one neighborhood or another and nobody I know really lives close to the Buddha.\nThe airport is pretty close by. This might be a good pre-flight send-off location.","I have had dim sum in New Orleans and Phoenix (not SF), and this is about equal to the best of New Orleans as far as flavor.\nAs for ambiance, today was a good day. I've had dim sum here about a dozen times, and have had very good service and quality 90% of the time, including weekends. I have had bad days here, but since today was good, I'll rate accordingly. It's closer to a 4.5, but since I can't give half-stars, I rounded up.\nDon't expect me to give these the right names, but... I was less than impressed with the bbq pork balls. They tasted too much like honey and the beef was minimal. The bbq sauce tasted bottled. Outside of that, their herbal hot tea is delicious even on a hot day.\nThe shu mai were very good, and the shrimp in a spinach dumpling was fantastic. A definite don't miss is their sticky rice in lotus leaf. It's among the best I've had anywhere. Just be careful; you'll find bones in it every once in a while. Go for any of their steamed dumplings; they're very flavorful. As others have said, I love the Chinese broccoli, but you'll only find it on the carts on weekends. Otherwise order it off the menu.\nToday (11:30 lunch) the carts came around often, and everything except the pork buns was piping hot and fresh. By the way, despite the price increases, even the sticky rice was considered a medium size entree, and the two of us eating there escaped with a bill under $20 and we were done in under 30 minutes.\nI strongly recommend the dim sum here, whether you've had it a million times or have never had it before. You usually won't be disappointed.","I don't really understand the poor reviews on this place.....maybe it depends on the day you go? We went on a Sunday, it was crazy busy, but service was great! (of course, my view of customer service is a little different then the rest... I used to live on an island where you were just happy to find what you were looking for, let alone expect good customer service) Anyways, our server was very sweet! Always had a smile on her face. The carts served us promplty and none of the food was cold. They always had whatever we wanted (I hate having to wait for the next cart).\n\nNow, as for the actual dim sum and food.......holy cow, to die for! So flavorful and fresh!! The broccoli makes you sing...and the wine noodles, make you cry. You leave with very weird mixed emotions, but mostly a happy belly full of yummy food.\n\nIn my opinion, this is the best dim sum I have been able to find in Phx. I'm ditching my previous spot (Mekong Palace) and will be back to Golden Buddha when the dim sum monster strikes again!"],"type":["Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low

hotel and not really having eaten much all day, I was hungry.\n\nThe service was terrible....no one knew what they were doing so it took 10 minutes to get a freaking slice of pizza and then when said pizza came it was NASTY.\n\nMy husband once got a pizza in Milwaukee where they put Kraft singles on it as cheese and Pizza Parma is just behind that for worst pizza ever.","Looking for a quick bite to eat and a local told me this was \"the best pizza in the city.\"  I got a plain slice and a pepperoni slice. Possibly the worst pizza I have ever eaten.  This wouldn't even qualify as pizza in North Jersey.  I ate half of the plain slice because I was starving....then threw both in the garbage.  \n\nIf this is really the best pizza in Pittsburgh... wow.","I ordered from Pizza Parma out of storm necessity. I ordered a chicken parmigiana \"hoagie\", which was dry and luke warm. The potato bacon soup was like something out of a can, except the chunks of potato were hard and undercooked..all pretty nasty and overly salty.\n\nNever order from them.","Zero stars. Came in 10 mins before close. Female manager on duty asked for $100 in exchange for a pizza. When we refused she said she could not serve us because her employees had been working since 9am..,it is currently 2:00 am... Sounds pretty illegal to me","Average pizza. But with ten guys working - and not much business at the moment - it still took twenty minutes to get a slice of pepperoni. I'll walk across the street next time.","My butthole hasn't been right for days, nor my stomach. \n\nWe ordered in because we all had a long day and were set to have a family movie night.\n\nA pizza and hoagie. \n\nThe hoagie wasn't anything to run and go scream from the rooftops about but the pizza was covered in little ass ruining intestinal demons and this I am nearly sure of.\n\nI had to be talked out of sending pizza Parma a bill for several rolls of toilet paper.\n\nBe weary of the pizza, distrustful actually.\n\nYour butthole will thank me for it!","Hubby and I dropped in after a hellish morning at the Social Security office. Hubby loves pizza so we made a stop.\n\nPizza wan't bad, it was actually pretty decent. But the place was disgusting and the cashier was incredibly rude.","I eat this pizza all the time when downtown, usually when running around at events like First Night or the Gallery Crawls...not the best pizza I have ever had in my life, but it's not bad!  And I haven't ever gotten sick from it.  Just wanted to offer a different opinion.","PIzza Parma's decent tasting mega-big-2ft-long hot sausage hoagie was let down by the piss poor attitude of the staff, the lack of cleanliness of the tables and floor, the out-of-order red door restroom, the bright yellow for no-explicable reason walls. \n\nThe large color-striped 80's retro tables and green chairs have come back in style but this win is purely accidental and achieved only by laziness and lack of renovation.\n\nThat is all.","My fiance & I have lived in downtown Pittsburgh for over a year + now & this place is fabulous. \nMy sweetie LOVES LOVES LOVESSS pizza & we order from here a ton.  We haven't ordered anything here that wasn't super tasty.\nThe shop is small & the decor is super bright which makes you want to get in & out quickly but who the hell eats in there anyways. ... you're grabbing your order & running.","I'm glad I listened to my friend's recommendation and not some of these bad reviews. We're just in town for the night and wanted something delivered to our hotel. They said it would take an hour, which I expected on Super Bowl Sunday right at game time, but it was here in less than half an hour. \n\nThe pizza was delicious! Just the right balance of cheese and a tasty sauce, generous with the toppings, and a nicely crispy crust but not too thin.","This place has great service! My best friend and I got 2 custom orders and the older guy in back came out to the register to take our orders personally.  I assume he's either the cook, owner, or both. We ordered 2 cheeselss pizzas; a lot of places mess this up. Pizza Parma however, makes great cheeseless pizza. Our personal pizzas were nice and toasty, not over nor undercooked, and it was not dried out at all! There was more than enough sauce mmmmmmmmm.","My fiance & I have lived in downtown Pittsburgh for over a year + now & this place is fabulous. \nMy sweetie LOVES LOVES LOVESSS pizza & we order from here a ton.

waiter was to be found about ten minutes later they gave us our water and left again! It wasn't even busy! There were only TWO dim sum carts floating around somewhere. Then our waiter finally came around and took our orders of lunch entrees. The food was not even that good as the reviews that are posted on here. When we came up to pay, the bill was super overpriced. I will not be returning here, I am better off eating at Great Wall Cuisine.","If this place had zero stars I would have given them that ! Let me start off by saying I was so excited to read all great reviews so maybe I just came in on a off day? We walked in and were seated came over and asked if we wanted water or tea I guess they don't serve anything Else, Then we placed an order pork dumplings and sticky rice nasty! Then I asked if they served egg rolls they said they were out!!! they pushed their little carts around with hot plates that basically steam the food and is not fresh and what you get is soggy poor customer service we had to get up and look for someone to give us our tab so we could get the heck out of there are get some real food. It looked like it would be a great place for groups of people would not recommend if you are on mission for what you want and want to place an order but it could be a fun experience for some people.","You walk into a Chinese restaurant on a Saturday afternoon for dim sum and you expect the place to be PACKED.  Well, walking in to a pretty much empty dining room, it's a VERY CLEAR SIGN.  But my friend insisted and I was very hesitant for good reasons.  Another indicator, the majority of the patrons were NON Asian.  \n\nFood: You walk in and you see carts of the food by the entrance to the dining room.  Umm, I thought dim sum should come right off the steamer and into the carts and they roll it around, not sitting around.  The dim sum was garbage.  It had the typical selection, but at minimum.  \n\nService: It's ok.  But it doesn't make up for the horrible food.\n\nBottom line: NO WAY!  Stay away!","I've been here many times...Mother's Day with family, dim sum with book club, etc. But I will not go back again.  I stopped in to ask the owner about a donation or reduced price for a class of under-privileged kids that I volunteer with.  His reaction was to scoff and shoo me out the door while handing me his card and saying I could email him.  He turned his back and headed off to the messy newspaper-strewn table he haunts between guests arrivals.  Maybe he's a community-minded business owner, but then again, maybe he's not.  I'll be dining elsewhere.","Being from Chicago, we are used to getting authentic Chinese food all the time.  But when we first starting spending a lot of time in Scottsdale/Phoenix, we found it a challenge to get authentic Chinese food.  We were excited to find the Golden Buddha and have made many trips over the years all the way from the Troon North area to get our fix.  However, service has declined to the point where it is no longer worth the aggravation.  We went there last night for Chinese New Year and will never go back.  Granted they were very busy because of a lot of large tables there, but waiting almost an hour to get our food is not acceptable under any circumstance!  45 mins. into our wait, the waitress came back (after we flagged her down to ask about our food) and said one of the dishes we ordered was not available....after 45 mins.!!!! What makes the whole experience an unforgivable one is that the manager/owner is so indifferent and never apologized or offered a discount off the bill...nothing.  When we left, the same manager was at the piano singing in Chinese. Huh?  Other than Nee House in Scottsdale, the search goes on for a restaurant that serves authentic Chinese food closer to home.","I will NEVER go there again.  I reserved a table for a group of 16 people for 5:00 PM on Christmas Eve .  The person on the phone ( I believe the manager) repeatedly asked me to call ahead and give him an accurate head count since he said they'd be swamped that day.  I followed up with him twice.  \nWhen the first couple of us arrived, we had menus shoved in our faces immediately and told we \"Must order now.  Must order now\" because they were going to be busy later on.  The place was practically empty.  As each person arrived, they were treated the same way. \nWe rushed and placed our orders and then they brought out our checks WAY before we saw any sign of our food.  I have never in my life been treated so rudely by a restaurant.\nIt was utter chaos when the food started coming out while everyone struggled to get the correct dish they ordered.  One person didn't get her food until we were all just about finished eating. \nOne top of all that, the food wasn't even good.  I've had better Kung Pao Chicken at Panda Express!\nAfter being rushed through our meal, the place wasn't even half full by the time we left.  I thought being at the Cultural Center, this restaurant would be a sure thing but boy was I wrong.  Lovely way to spend Christmas Eve..","If you are looking a chinese restaurant to host a big party look some other than the Golden Buddah.  I recently attended a banquet at the Golden Buddah and I was shocked at the level of quality of food and service.  Of the 10 dishes served 4 were nearly inedible.  \n\nThere was a crab claw appetizer, most chinese restaurants prepare this dish by taking a crab claw surrounding it with ground shrimp, batter and then deep fry.  At Golden Buddah, the crab claw served was mostly batter.  \n\nThe shark fin soup served was mostly broth.  Shark fin is an expensive ingredient and most places usually use imitation shark fin, but come on at least put something in there so that I know I'm eating soup and not dirty sink water.  \n\nGinger scallion lobster is battered, fried, and then stir fried in a sauce with ginger and scallions.  The ginger scallion lobster served was over-cooked and dried out.  \n\nLastly, there was a steamed fish.  The fish was raw in the middle.   \n\nIt wasn't all bad, there was a crispy chicken with garlic dish that was pretty good, but out of 10 dishes 4 were bad, 5 were okay, and 1 was good.  \n\nDoes 4 bad dishes out of 10 warrant a one star rating?  Well it does when you factor in the service.  The soup, appetizer, and first entree arrived timely, but after that there was a 1 hour gap before we received the next dish.  The dishes were not served with accompanying white rice which I thought was odd.  We had to ask for it, and even the rice took a while to arrive.","I agree with Crystal C., that the dim sum isn't the greatest I've ever had. In fact, I am not sure if the meal was so tasty that it was memorable. I do remember the \"calamari\" was not really calamari, like you would think. It was presented more like a sweet and sour pork (so calamari with LOTS of breading) without any sauce. As a result, the dish was dry and salty.\n\nThe sticky rice was good (hard to mess up), the chicken feet were okay (needed more five spice powder), and the shumai was alright. The noodles were good, and I can see why the cart ran out after the first round. The diners were an equal mix of Asians and Americans. I would've preferred to see more Asians eating (as I am used to in a Chinatown and gives an indication of authenticity), but I do realize we're in Phoenix where the Asian population is not like San Francisco or Houston. \n\nThe meal came to about $30 for two, including jasmine tea. The carts are loud because they are made out of metal and roll on tile. I am also not used to staff members shouting what they have in their cart, like a newspaper boy yelling \"Extra! Extra!\" Christmas music was playing after mid-January, so the atmosphere felt strange. Next time I visit the city, I probably will pass.","Can't say that I was very impressed. Came for dinner in a hopeful and enthusiastic mood since the reviews have been pretty good, but I don't think this place lives up to its current good, but declining rating.\n\nOrdered the Combo fried rice (shrimp, chicken, beef, pork), sesame chicken, and garlic fried chicken. \n\nThe combo fried rice was pretty good, but ended up drinking about 6 glasses of water due to the MSG and sodium content. You'd think that the cook spent his better years in the French Foreign Legion in the Sahara eating salt tablets and developed a taste for them. \n\nThe sesame chicken had a good flavor and a thick brown sweet sauce. I liked it a lot until it got cool and the sauce looked (with that stringy consistency) more like glue. You think I'm kidding? I'm not.\n\nGarlic fried chicken was bad. Just bad. It was like an over roasted dried out half chicken with some dried garlic pieces sprinkled on top. No spices, no flavor, no good. \n\nWe then got all kinds of lip from the waitress when we asked if they could change the channel on the TV from college football, to the Suns game. They made it into this big deal that the \"customers\" wanted to see the football game. Yeah right, it was University of West Virginia Vs. University of Connecticut! I would have believed it if it was a local team....\n\nIt's better than a 1 star joint, but only because it's borderline edible. To be avoided.","This restaurant is located in the Chinese Cultural Center and was the one restaurant that I had not been to. So after some shopping at one of the shops, we stepped in to have dinner.\n\nWe stepped in and asked for a seat for two. We were seated immediately. The place was decorated nicely and a lady playing the piano made for great ambiance.\n\nWe looked at the menu briefly and ordered our drinks, an appetizer, a soup and two main dishes. The drinks came out promptly and so did the rest of the meal. My goodness everything we ordered was very tasty.\n\nThe waiter service itself however was not even close to the decor and food. He never introduced himself, and although he took our order, our food itself was brought out by a kitchen person.\n\nAfter we ordered our waiter really never came back asking if we needed anything else, except to give us our check at the end and that was after the person I was dining with got up and asked a different waiter for it.\n\nIt's amazing how a place with great food, decor, and ambiance can mess it all up by crappy waiter service.","I love Dim Sum, my favorite Chinese dish.\n\nWhen Golden Buddha first open, they have excellent Dim sum. I went there many times, I tell my friend how good it is, But now,  they change cook, taste more like  week old left over. Rumor has it, they change cook every few month, so Quality of cooking change. (not sure if that is true, but that is what I was told.)\nMy advice is; when you walk in the door and the place is pack, = Good Cook. if the place is bare = bad cook. leave immediately. don't waste your money.","If you just \"want\" dim sum, go here. If you are \"craving\" dim sum, go elsewhere (take a 5 hour drive west to neighboring state, California).\n\nAnyway, I've been visiting Golden Buddha in the noontime for roughly 2 years now. I believe they moved from their original site (7th St. & Osborn), formerly \"China Doll.\" Relocation brought along better atmosphere and smiling faces. This does not mean, better dim sum. But since we are in Phoenix, I will settle for what they have to offer. \n\nBe mindful of the dim sum tab. It's itemized high-medium-low. \n\nShaomai can be found as combinations of pork/mushroom, shrimp, or shark fin (which should not be confused as true shark bits, as the shaomai is prepared to look like a shark's fin). These picks are okay...perhaps on a better day shao mai will be served in less-rigid, or fresher wrappers. Potstickers are okay as well, just the usual scallion and pork, and dry wrapper. The baby pork ribs in light black bean sauce and jalapenos is alright, but sometimes lacks in taste. Tripe is also served in its bare minimum...so if you enjoy the texture and flavor of tripe, try this with its clear sauce and thinly sliced carrots and celery.  \nBuche (that's what I call it), or fried sesame balls are also available, although if you wait until dessert, they will also be a bit stiff. There are a few other things that may be \"spotted\" but are not worth mentioning. \n\nDon't order from their lunch menu, as you can find these over-salted dishes at Panda Express anyway. \n\nOverall, dim sum at Golden Buddha is a place to go if you are around the vicinity and feel like having something apart from the usual fast food. However, discriminating palates- beware.","Not impressed with this place at all. This was not the friendliest place around, maybe because of the language barrier (most or all were clearly native Chinese speakers), or maybe just the attitude of the employees.\n\nI ordered the sweet and sour chicken lunch, which came with the typical egg drop soup, crab rangoon, and egg roll. The soup was ok - maybe it's just me, but I prefer a real spoon to the scoop that they gave me. The egg roll was tiny and not that great, and the crab rangoon was ok, but maybe a little undercooked. The chicken wasn't bad, but nothing special, as was the rice and other stuff on the plate.\n\nOverall, this was just not my kind of Chinese place.","Disappointing.  Mediocre at best.  I am staying at the Aloft hotel in phoenix and ordered some delivery. I ordered a couple american chinese food staples: general tso's chicken, dumplings and hot&sour soup.  Soup had zero flavor, dumplings tasted freezer burned and processed.  General tso chicken was ehh. \n\nA lot of good reviews on here so it must be for eat in and for their dim sum.  Don't order delivery, you will be left hungry and unsatisfied.","Went there on Saturday for early lunch.  My wife did the dim sum, it was okay, we were both disgusted by the sugar cane shrimp; but the rest was good.  \n\nI ordered the chicken szechwuan, the waitress warned me it was \"spicy\" the reason I ordered it.  It came out delicious, but not what I would call spicy.  Overall its hard to find good Chinese in the valley and I would call this good without hesitation.","So I was referred to this place from the front desk of my hotel. I'm from SF so I'm coming from a place with really good chinese food. \n\nThe dim sum is just \"ok\" nothing for me to write home about. The one dish that I really liked was the chinese broccoli cooked with garlic sauce. Yum yum yum.  It's in a big bowl, not oily, not saucy, just really good. I think it's $7.50.  \n\nIt's a somewhat pricey and just like all chinese restaurants, it's not the cleanest.  The chair was filthy.  the dishes weren't all that great.  I wouldn't go back unless I want the chinese broccoli.  \n\nSo I went on a Sunday and it was not crowded at all. There's not a huge asian population  in Phoenix (not that I could tell) so I don't think there's a high demand for dim sum.  And also, I sooooooo felt like taking a pic of this, but a Mexican lady was pushing one of the dim sum carts. That is unheard of in SF.  This is a mainly mandarin restaurant and the dim sum places I go are usually cantonese.  Not a big deal though since the dishes look the same. \n\nDude, there was a turtle in the fish tank that I saw as I left.  I hope they don't eat that!","A Premier Chinese Atmosphere,\nThe Chinese cultural center and Asian Garden produces an Asain atmosphere that can be recognized from the 202.  \n With Dim Sum served this location earns its respect from the local community.\n\nDim Sum tip,  You have to be smart with the Dim Sum ladies they look nice innocent but they are professional sales people that will sell you more dishes than you need before you know what to do.  \n\nI love the desserts here ask the server to see the dessert tray.","This restaurant has a bit of an identity crisis. It is in the Chinese cultural center, but serves Japanese beer (Kirin on tap!) and the live piano music is American pop. We had to ask for chopsticks.\n\nHaving said that, the service was professional. Our waiter held a hot appetizer for one of our party who was away from the table so that it would not be cold when he returned. We were asked frequently--and not too frequently--if things were ok both by our waiter and the manager/proprietor.\n\nThe food was ok-to-good. Fried shrimp egg rolls were dainty but yummy. Duck was tasty but very chewy. Kung-pao chicken was pleasantly spiced. Plenty of rice. A pitcher of ice water with lemon was left at the table. \n\nAtmosphere was also pleasant. Chairs comfortable, tables spaced well, restrooms large and clean...and there is indeed a large golden Buddha by the entrance.","I took a group of friends here and relatives other times. The place is consistently good for Dim-sum during lunch. It is typical Chinese and nothing fancy.\n\nWhat helps this place is the moat scenery.  3 stars for visiting here based on convenience since there are similar places in town.","Having grown up in Hong Kong and having eaten dim sum in London, NY, LA, SF and Vancouver (actually Richmond), I can confidently say I know my dim sum.\n\nGood selection of well-executed dim sum when the carts actually come around and there's anything left in it.  I'd give it 4 stars for food but the wait definitely detracted from the whole experience.\n\nI think the problem with Golden Buddha is that they can't handle the heavy flow on weekends.  There's not enough regular dim sum eaters like LA that can sustain a steady flow of diners throughout the week, forcing restaurants like Golden Buddha to depend heavily on extra part-time help on weekends.  \n\nDim sum takes serious skill so the chef still ends up doing most of the work.  When we looked into the kitchen, we saw a Chinese woman doing most of the cooking herself.  No wonder it took forever for a cart to come out and when it does, it's swarmed on by a pack of vultures.\n\nIf you're willing to eat at a more simply decorated place with a smaller menu, I'd highly recommend China Chan.  It's much more relaxed - usually no wait on weekends.  An experienced chef makes all the dim sum himself so the menu's much shorter but all the classics are on it.  Anything steamed is made to order so is very fresh.","Situated in the Chinese Cultural Center near the SkyHarbor Airport, this was another pleasant find. All I had was the Dim Sum menu, and I would say this is the best you're gonna get in Phoenix. Still worth the stop to get your Dim Sum fix. The cart ladies were pleasant and very happy to converse with me in Cantonese. Only downside was the chicken sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaves, naw mei gai, was way overcooked, and mushy.","Do you want to eat Chinese Food in an elegant environment on a Friday night in Phoenix? \n\nBe entertained by classic, quiet standards being played live on a piano while you dine?\n\nAre you 50 years old and Caucasian?\n\nThen the Golden Buddha is the place for you! \n\nIts in the Chinese Cultural Center Mall on 44th, and a popular weekend spot for Dim Sum. For a DIm Sum starved Valley of the Sun, Golden Buddha's is decent. \n\nFor dinner, though, it is awfully Americanized and not very authentic Chinese. But with a bunch of American customers coming for dinner, what do you expect? They probably think they are getting \"real Chinese\" food by going to the Chinese Mall, but then again, they are used to PF Chang's or Stix normally in their neighborhood, so this is a step up.\n\nThe best thing about this place is the decor, which is clean and nice, with a Hong Kong Junk boat design covering the ceiling from the bar into the dining room. The next best thing is the Piano interludes on weekend nights. The service is next, which is a little overly eager to remove your plate, and the last thing is the food. \n\nThey do give decent portions. I ordered Guo Teh (potstickers) and got 6 fat ones. But they weren't served with the usual soy, chili oil and vinegar, but a soy and green onions mixture. The Mapo Tofu was ok, as they used a nice silky tofu, which was nice, but no green onions, and sliced black mushrooms instead, which I like, but not in this dish.\n\nCome here for the ambiance and music in the evenings, or on the weekend days for Dim Sum.","Decent dim sum, especially to be found in the middle of the desert. Sadly, the best food I've had in Phoenix.","This place is a little difficult for me to review.  I was staying at the Hampton Inn across the street and this is the closest restaurant so off I went.\n\nI walked in and the owner or manager met me at the door and asked \"how many\"?\n\nI told him I wanted to order take out and handed me a menu and pointed to the waiting area which was covered in newspapers.  I chose to go to the bar, order a glass of wine, and peruse the menu.\n\nThe drinks are expensive but I didn't think the food was.  Less than $10 for my Mongolian Chicken which came with white sticky rice and a fortune cookie.  When ordering I asked if I could have fried rice instead of white rice but was told \"no\".  Most places allow this for a nominal fee.\n\nFine by me.  Give the white rice.  Food was prepared and their to-go boxes were a lot better than the standard white Chinese \"to go\" boxes.  They also included the plastic-ware, napkin, and soy sauce, which a lot of places forget.\n\nLooking around I found a whole lot of goodness along with a couple disappointments.  Most notably the newspaper strewn about and behind the bar, to the right were a lot of boxes stacked in an unsightly fashion.  I could have been a little more presentable in my opinion.\n\nI peeked into the dining room because I wanted to see if the piano music was piped in or live.  It was live which was very nice. Also, the dinning room looked very nice and cozy.\n\nAs I was leaving the same man who greeted me upon entering made sure to wish me a good evening.  My initial impression of the man was that he was surly and testy but that's just how he comes off.\n\nThe food was very good.  The Mongolian sauce was mixture of sweet with spice and the chicken and vegetables all tasted fresh.","My husband and I went there Saturday, the service was great!  Our friends were going to be late so they told us to start.  And start we did!\nThey were serving Dim Sum, something we had never tried, so glad we did, it was wonderful, hubby wouldn't do the chicken feet, but I think next time I will, it looked very good.\nOur friends showed up and ordered their food, and ate all of it, they said that usually they take food home, but it was so good they had to eat all of it!\nWe will be going back very soon!","Let's see, over 50... check \nold white man...........check \neats dinner ...............check \nlistens to the piano  check \n\nwow this must be the place for me, I mean after all it is in a Chinese mall, no make that a Chinese Cultural Center. How could I possibly have discerning taste with such trickery to get me here to eat. \nDude if you are going to rate a restaurant no need to degrade others with your arrogance. \nFool is my review of wanugee N. \n\nNow on the restaurant. The last time we were here the food was not good, the piano was too loud and the waitress had a real attitude. IT won't keep me from going back as I have had good meals and wait service too. \n\nBack to wanugee N. I do not expect any place in Phx. to have authentic Chinese food, by that I mean the street food one finds in China. \nBut I do expect what I fork in to my mouth is worth what I am going to fork over in cost. Even an old white guy like me can tell the difference between good and bad food. No matter what it is called.","Okay so Ive been glum the past few days as I have an impending birthday. Every year this time I get all down in the dumps.. not that I'm not happy with my life cause life is good. Its more like getting further away from my youth and closer to being well, old. All of my grandparents were crotchety, sourpuss drama queens.. is that my fate? Can I break the mold or am I to going to be a crotchety sourpuss?\n\nSo as I contemplate and figure out what I'm going to do with my birthday baggage I decide to squash it with food. All weekend Ive been eating out and having a good time. This is one of the few times outside of a vacation where I will live it completely and to the near of sheer gluttony. So why not dim sum? \n\nIve chowed much dim sum in my 36 years of earthen wear.. of course some good and some bad. I have never been to a place where every dish was great.. Golden Buddha is no exception to this.. they do the basics well enough and have enough funky cool Asian style to keep me interested in returning. The carts around 1130 flow well but around noon it' s full blown freeway action! In fact there might be some road kill in there based on some of the looks on that last steam cart.. \n\nMe and 3 others who were feeling my pain ordered 14, count them, 14 different dishes. One of my friends is from Georgia and had never had dim sum but he is so courageous and unflinching that he was just a blast. Just the shot in the arm to get me out of my funk. I remember the first time I had dim sum.. my eyes wide open, nostrils flared and excited to see what was under the next steamer lid. That was him today.. one exciting thing after the next.. he was even willing to try chicken feet but this is one of those dishes not done very well here. \n\nMy friend took me back to a time where I was younger and less experienced. He looked up to me to guide him through the noodles, bao and sui mai.. like a big brother.. I'm privileged that I could show him something new and exciting and he was so into it! So instead of feeling sorry for myself I felt experienced and useful.. that there is something I can give back to others.. that its not all about me and me aging but about what can be shared with others.\n\nThere is so much more to do, give and feel in this short time we are here.. and Ill do it to, one bite at a time.","The best to be found in land locked Arizona.  My favorite sticky rice is here.  They have dim sum every day, but not a huge selection, though you can order off the menu.  I think it is much bigger on the weekends.  I'm just happy I can get my fix 7 days a week.  Beautiful gardens to walk through, with fish ponds, and a 99 market next door!","I ate at Golden Buddha a few weeks ago.  We ate at the restaurant after a day at the zoo with our 4 year old and had a blast.  The piano bar played tunes for my daughter and the staff was more than accommodating.  The general tso chicken was better than anything I can get in Tucson.  The soup was chocked full of fresh, read FRESH, not canned, vegetables.  All in all, I was very satisfied with the meal and the service.  Plus the decor is very nice, clean and cheery. \n\nEat at Golden Buddha.","For those who gave this place low marks, forgive me. I really like this place. Now I haven't tried various dim sum places so I'm reserving the right to downgrade the place as needed. The variety of food is plentiful, and the carts just keep on coming. I love the steamed pork buns, and the shiu mai (not sure if I spelled that correctly). Yesterday, my favorite pick was the deep fried rolls of taro and shrimp. YUM! I have never ordered from their menu so I can only talk about their dim sum. My friends and I try to go eat dim sum almost every Sunday. It's a cheap way to try new foods, and if you don't like it, well.. you can get away with pushing it aside with minimal guilt. Give it a try! You might be surprised.","I like Golden Buddha, have taken many friends there for Dim Sum.  \nTry not to \"hit\" the dumpling cart to heavy; otherwise cannot finish it to the dessert cart (LOL).\nLove the jasmine tea and the staff willing to help you if you do not understand the what each item is.\nSingapore Rice Noodles a favorite, along with any of the shrimp dumplings; also the broccoli and green beans.\nOnly wish that the carts with eggplant stuffed with shrimp or green peppers with shrimp were not on \"heated\" carts; by the time it gets to you the food is cold.\nOnly concern is that went on 22MAY2010 at 1:30PM; there was a closed sign due to electricity???\nREVISED: 26MAY2010 - called this evening - looks like they are back open again.","I've been to the Golden Buddha on several occasions and it is my favorite, by far, for honest Chinese food. \nWhile I've sampled everything from their vegetarian to their beef, I love their mandarin chicken. More recently, I was delighted to relive the wonders of their Kung Pao Chicken and Beef with Broccoli. \nI absolutely love the egg drop soup and mini crab rangoons that come with the meal.","The very first time I went to Golden Buddha was with my BFF and it was our first dim sum experience. Little did I know this would forever change my life and eating experiences. Although I must admit that first time was a bit awkward.\n\nGB wisely takes reservations which was wonderful (even though it wasn't crazy busy). Our assorted dim sum plates were flavorful and fresh. And the carts seemed to be in constant rotation so we were never too far from a good selection.\n\nWhat really helps GB is its location. The Cofco Center is an experience in itself, where one can have herbs specially blended, select a fresh member of marine life to take home and cook or browse through a store with one of the largest selections of Buddhas and hand fans I've experienced outside of San Francisco.","I've been to Golden Buddha a few times and have not been disappointed. \n\nThey have a LARGE selection of Dim Sum and if you're not careful you can get carried away.\n\nTry and get there early and you'll get the best and most fresh selection.\nMake sure you walk around the garden when you're done.","Probably the most comprehensive Chinese menu in the Valley.  Pick from well over 100 dishes, but if you want the best order the Peking Duck.  Everything else is very good, but without a wow factor.  You'll see lots of Chinese people in this massive restaurant, which probably means they're doing a fine job in the kitchen.","I very much enjoyed eating here. Food was great. Fairly fast service. Wasn't expensive either for the 4 of us.","Golden Buddha has GREAT dim sum.  Their prices are reasonable and the staff is very polite wheeling their little carts.  I tend to go on the weekend because there is more selection but they do dim sum throughout the week.  They also have some very authentic dishes on the menu for those who are more of the adventurous types.  Be sure to say hello to the turtles the next time you go.","This place in the Chinese Cultural Center has a very pretty and elegant bar area. I was pleased to learn that they had some very reasonable and delicious happy hour snacks. This is a good place for a Pina Colada. I had one by myself along with some dumplings and fried shrimp appetizer. Sadly I never brought anyone else here with me. It was happy hour heaven but you know? A lot of my friends in AZ pretty much hang out in one neighborhood or another and nobody I know really lives close to the Buddha.\nThe airport is pretty close by. This might be a good pre-flight send-off location.","I have had dim sum in New Orleans and Phoenix (not SF), and this is about equal to the best of New Orleans as far as flavor.\nAs for ambiance, today was a good day. I've had dim sum here about a dozen times, and have had very good service and quality 90% of the time, including weekends. I have had bad days here, but since today was good, I'll rate accordingly. It's closer to a 4.5, but since I can't give half-stars, I rounded up.\nDon't expect me to give these the right names, but... I was less than impressed with the bbq pork balls. They tasted too much like honey and the beef was minimal. The bbq sauce tasted bottled. Outside of that, their herbal hot tea is delicious even on a hot day.\nThe shu mai were very good, and the shrimp in a spinach dumpling was fantastic. A definite don't miss is their sticky rice in lotus leaf. It's among the best I've had anywhere. Just be careful; you'll find bones in it every once in a while. Go for any of their steamed dumplings; they're very flavorful. As others have said, I love the Chinese broccoli, but you'll only find it on the carts on weekends. Otherwise order it off the menu.\nToday (11:30 lunch) the carts came around often, and everything except the pork buns was piping hot and fresh. By the way, despite the price increases, even the sticky rice was considered a medium size entree, and the two of us eating there escaped with a bill under $20 and we were done in under 30 minutes.\nI strongly recommend the dim sum here, whether you've had it a million times or have never had it before. You usually won't be disappointed.","I don't really understand the poor reviews on this place.....maybe it depends on the day you go? We went on a Sunday, it was crazy busy, but service was great! (of course, my view of customer service is a little different then the rest... I used to live on an island where you were just happy to find what you were looking for, let alone expect good customer service) Anyways, our server was very sweet! Always had a smile on her face. The carts served us promplty and none of the food was cold. They always had whatever we wanted (I hate having to wait for the next cart).\n\nNow, as for the actual dim sum and food.......holy cow, to die for! So flavorful and fresh!! The broccoli makes you sing...and the wine noodles, make you cry. You leave with very weird mixed emotions, but mostly a happy belly full of yummy food.\n\nIn my opinion, this is the best dim sum I have been able to find in Phx. I'm ditching my previous spot (Mekong Palace) and will be back to Golden Buddha when the dim sum monster strikes again!"],"type":["Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low

Goulash in the Contrucci household was made of elbow noodles, beef and spaghetti sauce.  I guess you can't believe everything your parents tell you right?  \n\nSo going in here, I was thinking, great...mom's goulash!  What was set in front me looked NOTHING like what I was used to.  It was a mish mosh of veggies,noodles, gravy and some random unidentifiable food items.  I usually eat whatever is put in front of me, so I wasn't scared to dive it.  Sadly, I just didn't like it.  I thought it was actually not very appetizing at all.  I know, I know, this is like \"world famous\" goulash, but I was NOT into it!  \n\nWhat I was into was the German Potato Salad.  I love it, and honestly, I feel like I never get the same version of it anywhere in the Burgh.  This was a no frills version, with scallop sliced potatoes and a thick vinegar sauce.  Maybe a bit too much, but not enough for me to eat it all!  \n\nWould I go back? If someone else really wanted to go there, but I wouldn't suggest it nor would I go on my own.  Oh well, on to the next one right?","This used to be the best German food in town. I have seen a gradual decline in the food over the past several years. The gravies have changed and the Max's Goulash (one of my favorite dishes) has a different sauce (strangely dessert sweet) and change in the protein. The sides are still great, but the food used to be so much better.","The goulash was (sickeningly) sweet and the bread pudding wasn't sweet at all.  But the atmosphere is kind of cool.  And the prices are downright cheap.","After hearing Hofbrauhaus-haters say that Max's Allegheny Tavern is the only place to go in Pittsburgh for German food, my husband and I decided to finally try the restaurant this afternoon.\n\nWe were seated in little booths right next to the bar. They were cozy, but the seats reminded me of old fashioned church pews. Our waitress soon brought us a little basket of four rolls with butter, sauerkraut relish, and apple butter. Though I liked the different varieties of bread, it was nothing special. The relish and apple butter were a nice touch though.\n\nOur waitress was busy with both waiting tables and tending the bar, but she managed to check on us pretty frequently. Our food also came out relatively promptly. I order the Wiener Schnitzel with Potato Pancakes and Spatzle on the side. The Wiener Schnitzel was amazing -- by far the best I've ever had! The veal was tender and the fried surface was perfectly crispy. However, the sides sadly did not match this main dish. The Potato Pancakes were oddly bitter, and I did not enjoy them with either the sour cream or applesauce. I only ate two or three bites and completely stopped eating them. (I must add that Hofbrauhaus's potato pancakes are delicious and something that I order every time that I go there.) I also did not enjoy the Spatzle, but I am accustomed to eating cheese Spatzle.... So I may be reviewing this harshly since I'm just not used to plain Spatzle, but in my opinion, it was terribly bland and watery.\n\nOverall, Max's Allegheny Tavern served one incredible item (Wiener Schnitzel), but everything else was merely mediocre. Because of this, I really don't plan on returning to the restaurant again any time soon. I'll be sticking with the fun environment and overall good food at Hofbrauhaus, actually.","I really thought I'd never be back.  The goulash I had was so so gross.  But then,  was roped in by some friends who were doing a Sunday brunch book club.  Of course I couldn't miss out on tantalizing conversation... so I obliged.  \n\nI really had no clue what they offered for brunch options, but quickly learned they have a a pretty decent size brunch buffet.  I'm not below buffets at all, it's the fat kid in me!  Most things still looked a little questionable to me, but I went for the big ticket items.  Make your own omelets, potato pancakes and dessert.  I'd hit up the buffet again, but still be hasty to check out the regular menu again.  \n\nThe omelet was made right in front of you, so I added cheese, mushrooms, peppers, tomatoes and onions.  I was super excited about it because it was the size of a football.  Sadly, it was pretty tasteless.  I don't think they added any salt or pepper to the egg mix, so it came out really bland, despite loading up on ingredients.  \n\nBut the potato pancakes... I could survive on them forever.  They were amazeballs!  Add some sour cream and I was in potato patch heaven!  I had to keep myself from getting more because of the other thing I loaded up on... dessert.  \n\nThe desserts looked unassuming, but they were also awesome.  I had a smattering of delectable bites.  The scones were so moist and tasty.  I had to stop myself from taking more than 20.  I also had some carrot cake, brownies, cookies among other things I inhaled and didn't pay attention too.  Should I be embarrassed?  Probably.  But I don't care because it was darn good!","I took my boyfriend, a German-food enthusiast, to Max's Allegheny Tavern last night. We had been looking forward to a night out together for a while. \n\nI think the food was good, but it's hard to say, because all I could focus on was the LOUD -- and I mean LOUD -- woman seated behind my boyfriend and me.\n\nHer profanity-laden discussion with her dining partners was so bad that for the first time in my life, I turned around and asked a fellow restaurant patron to take the volume down a few notches. \n\nThe restaurant was almost empty; I have no idea why the host chose to seat a loud party of five next to a couple having a quiet dinner.","FYI: New happy hour specials are awful. Just awful. Sorry guys, as much as i love you   I've got to put my food down somewhere. Even raising the prices on all of the apps to 3.99 would've been better than taking the pierogie (aka potato pockets) special off all together. \n\nWon't be back.","I've been here once because this was an easy place to meet for dinner with a friend. I enjoyed eating here well enough.\n\nI'm honestly not a die-hard fan of German food, although I guess that wouldn't have mattered: a peak at the menu beforehand revealed that this place's menu is mostly Americanized - proof of this is the fact that my salad was topped with French fries (only in Pittsburgh...). Trust me, even if you don't really like German food, there'll at least be a sandwich you'll like here.\n\nThinking about my usual \"overall\" summary, I have to say this place wasn't bad and served as a reasonable place to meet - the beer menu looked nice from what I saw and the atmosphere was pretty cozy and even nostalgic and homely - but man, the dining options really weren't that extraordinary. I'm still torn as to how to feel about its menu, because on the one hand obviously it being Americanized meant even I could find something to enjoy, but on the other I feel bad for the people who do like German food and may not be getting what they hope for. \n\nIt wasn't bad enough that I'd say don't try it and see - just understand it may not be exactly what you expect.","Authentic German fare. German beer. Best soft pretzels in Pittsburgh. Reasonable prices. Friendly service. Very fair portion sizes. You'll be taking a box home. The basement is nice. But sometimes used for private events. Has a very cozy \"grotto\" feel to it.","Want a taste of the old ethnic communities of Pittsburgh? Go to Max's Allegheny Tavern. German never tasted sooo nice!\n\nMenu Fav: Potato Pancake Reuben. Forget the bread and wrap your lips around sweet potato pancakes and loads of corned beef. Try the hot potato salad too.","This place is great for brunch on Sunday! The service is great and the food is delicious. I always leave stuffed and happy.","I have a friend that loves this place, and I have been told it's the best German food in Pittsburgh so I had to give it a try.\n\nI had the Roasted Loin of Pork Stubenkuchen Style with German Style Potato Salad, and Sauerkraut. Everything was really good. The Pork was delicious and that mushroom gravy that they put on it was nothing short of amazing. I want a whole bucket of the stuff to put on everything. The Sauerkraut was interesting featuring shredded pork mixed in. The german potato salad was good but was pretty much what I expected. \n\nTheir draft  beer Selection left a little bit to be desired but featured 5-8 beers many of them popular german style beers. \n\nI got a good idea what this place is all about and I have to say that I will be back for more.","I ordered the Roast Pork loin with Apple raisin dressing, sauerkraut, and German potatoes. Oh yeah... Right Choice! Took a little longer than usual as there was a Large Party of 16 that ordered Just prior to us. Happy to say the waitress took Great care of us, plenty of rolls, drink refills, etc. as we waited. Apple Strudel for the Final Act. So Good, I forgot to take a picture. lol","Diane is awesome, i used to live in PA and\nmoved to CA and this is a great place for a beer,\ncheap food and good friends.\nI miss this place.\nOne of my favorites places back home in PA!","I've been going to Max's off and on for 31 years (I KNOW!  How could someone as young as I am been going there for THAT long?)    And I am not from nor ever lived in the North Side!\n\nThat said...i have always loved the food and the place.   I was great the first time and was great last night!   Most of the mains can be recommended without reservation....last night I had roasted pork with dressing and gravy.  It was deliscious!    As for sides....I ALWAYS have potato pancakes and sweet and sour cabbage.  (Because of my eastern european background I am partial to both cabbage and potatoes.   Do not be afraid of the cabbage unless you dislike sour! \n\nWe didn't have dessert, but did have beer and drinks.   They have a nice selection.\n\nMy only complaint was that the food was slow to come out.   It was a busy Friday night and I wasn't going anywhere so I had anover beer.   No big problem.\n\nGive Max's a try.....it might make your favorite like it did mine!","I have a confession to make........the thing I like most about Max's is their bread!!! They are free....they are fresh made....hot and soft...different kinds....and so so delicious!\nI'm not a big fan of German food, but it's just my personal taste. The portions are large and atmosphere is very relaxing and casual. I like it.","Our first stop in Pittsburgh, what a great start! Had a couple of yuenglings, a warm, salty yummy soft pretzel and a big ole plate of German goodness in da tummy!\n\nThe Peasant Platter had knock wurst, weisswurst and a pork chop on top of heap of sauerkraut...with potato pancakes, spaetzel and a basket of baked breads!  So.much.food.  And oh soooo good!\n\nThe bar is cool, staff is really nice and I believe they offer their patrons a free ride to and from on game days!","We (my fiance and I) went out for a pseudo-couples' date with our good friends, Sara and Thom, to Max's to introduce them to some of the most authentic German food in da Burgh. Where most people associate Hofbrauhaus with the ultimate German beer-hall experience, I prefer Max's for the quieter, less raucous environs. (At least when it's not Oktoberfest)\n\nWe'd been there once before and immediately fell in love with the place. I (still) keep raving about the Sausage and Cheese platter. They've got some good Gouda. The Potato Pockets (pierogies) were OK -- I'd take some Pierogies Plus or Forgotten Taste over Max's, but that's just me.\n\nThe spaetzel was to die for, however. It's like a German Mac n' Cheese. And boy, do I love me some Mac n' Cheese. It literally melts in your mouth with its' ooey-gooey-ness.\n\nDrink-wise, I tried their German lager and Thom tried the sampler. Thom is a beer enthusiast. For around eight bucks, you get a GOOD amount of beers to try -- they are not some dinky little shot glass samples, either. Thom had some trouble near the end finishing it...it was so much beer. Bob had a Captain and ginger-ale...in a king-size goblet. Goblets are the ONLY way to serve adult bevvies.\n\nFor dinner, I had the pork loin over an apple-raisin gravy/bread concoction. The pork loin was flavorful and tender, and quite delicious. Sara had the sauerbraten and seemed to enjoy it. Bob's burger was ginormous and looked extra tasty.\n\nWe finished it off with the Apple Fritters. Now, these fritters aren't for the faint of heart. And they aren't your average dinky small sized portions, either. You get two huge deep fried apple fritters, covered in vanilla ice cream. One person CANNOT eat the whole serving. You must, I repeat MUST share them. If you attempt to eat the whole plate yourself, you will have flavor explosion, followed by severe heartburn. But damn, are they GOOD.\n\nOur visit ended up totaling 2 hours. One thing, though...please fix your outdoor sign. Usually it shines out like a red and blue beacon in the night for people to find their way there, but on Wednesday, it was out. Driving there, I got confused on where it exactly was (but I had a general idea, as I had been there before.).","Max's is my parents' favorite restaurant when they're in town visiting me. Good, solid food with a great deal of [German] variety. I love the German beer flights (i.e., beer sampler) and the atmosphere is funny - a bit like your grandmother's parlor. The bread that comes with entrees is delicious (pumperknickel + others), and their cherry sauer kraut is delicious as well.\n\nThe food is good, but you must be careful with certain dishes. One of the schnitzels that comes with carrots/peas is clearly bedecked in carrots & peas that were recently frozen. German food isn't exactly known for its vegetables, so I let it slide but I always remember not to order that dish when I'm there.","I have been coming to Max Allegheny Tavern since I was still in my mother's womb.  But seriously.  This place has been an institution for my family, and I really love it here.  I feel like this is some of the only German food in Pittsburgh, and I think it represents fairly well.  My thoughts:\n\nBrunch Buffet- I love the Sunday brunch buffet more than life.  Omelette station, German and American breakfast and lunch foods, and lots and lots of beautiful, delicious, and decadent desserts.  It's heaven on Earth.  There is usually a decent selection of meats, and the potato pancakes are almost always featured.  They've changed it a bit over the years, but I still love this buffet.\n\nAppetizers- My family loves the soft pretzels.  They are so yummy and buttery, but a bit heavy if you are going to eat your entire meal.  So make sure to share.\n\nMeals-  I, personally, have never had a bad meal here.  The sauasages of all varieties have been great.  The weinerschnitzel also great.  Sandwiches all good as well.  I really like the cheesy spaetzle dish that is just like macaroni and cheese but with spaetzle noodles!  I don't get too crazy and order anything complicated, though.\n\nSides-  I love love love their sides.  I could live on the spaetzle and potato pancakes.  Don't pass the sides up!\n\nDessert:  Also love their desserts.  There is a chocolate chocolate cake that they heat up with homemade whipped cream that is TO DIE FOR.  Not so shockingly, the apple strudel is wonderful as well.\n\nBesides the food, the servers are always very friendly and efficient.  There is also ample street parking, which is really nice.  Definitley check this place out if you have not yet.","How can there be no reviews of Max's Allegheny? This north side German food institution in Pittsburgh has been around for years and years and has menus that tell you so. They also tell you the story of the north side of Pittsburgh, which I also found interesting. The place itself has a lot of character and looks like it's seen a lot of years there. It's a little weathered, but definitely homey and sturdy.\n\nRandy S. and I headed there post Tazza D'Oro on a Sunday for brunch. It happened to be the same very Sunday the Pens were playing the Flyers in game 7, so all the waitresses were wearing Pens paraphernalia, which definitely added to the experience. On Sunday morning it has a brunch buffet with all the standards, plus a healthy dose of Germanic add ons like German farmers breakfast (eggs, sausage and gravy-ed potatoes), red cabbage, pork chops, sauerkraut and potato pancakes. \n\nThe brunch buffet is in a room with a giant tapestry of Neuschwanstein behind the guys at the omelet bar. If that's not rad, I don't know what is. We told the waitress we were going in, went and got back and sat down to find our two ice teas on the table in mason jars (always dope). \n\nThe food was just what you would expect in Pittsburgh: gut busting. It wasn't artisinal or fancy, healthy or particularly remarkable, but it was pretty fonking good and to eat that food in that restaurant really made me feel like I was in Pittsburgh. I can imagine all the food there would be of the 'hot and brown' category, in a positive way. And the waitress was probably the nicest on our drive from Dallas to CT. \n\nA really fun place, if showing it's age (though remorselessly).","Real german food (sausage, etc) and decent beer in family friendly atmosphere.\n\nThis is one of the good joints.","Max's is a great place for German food.  I've had several sandwiches, most of the appetizers and even the Sunday brunch (which has a good spread but can be hit or miss) -  though not all in one visit.\n\nI most recently took my Mom out for dinner using a Living Social deal I had.  Somehow, even though we have both been to Max's quite a few times before neither of us had ever seen the sampler platter option on their menu.  For just a bit more than the cost of the regular entrees, you can choose three entrees and two sides.  Obviously the portions of each selection are smaller than the individual meals, but the size is still generous and there were only a couple things not available for the sampler platter.  Between the two of us we selected six different items and four different sides to try and shared everything - and still had enough left for a full meal each the next day.  I can't even decide on my favorite of all the items we tried.  If you aren't sure about some of the entrees, this is a great way to see what you like.  I personally loved everything so much that I think my new go-to menu item from now on will be the sampler platter.  Not being forced to choose just one item is what living in America is all about.\n\nAll together I think our bill was around $35 (no alcoholic beverages consumed).  Some might consider this a tad pricey but the food is so good I usually don't mind the slightly higher cost.  Service has never been a problem for me in fact they've always been helpful when I have questions about the menu.  Full bar with numerous good beers on tap.  If you want German food in Pittsburgh, Max's is definitely the place to start.","Quaint spot on a back street in the North Side.  Very polite service, and delicious food at a great value.  Will definitely go back for authentic German fare.","One of my favorite north side haunts. Great to take visitors who need to understand what it means to be German in Pittsburgh. \n\nGet the soft pretzels. Get anything that comes with a potato pancake. Get the kielbasa. Get it all. You can't go wrong. \n\nOh, and the spaetzle. The spaetzle.......","Max's is one of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh.  It's the Kennywood Thunderbolt of Pittsburgh restaurants.  The Thunderbolt is considered one of the best rollercoasters in the country.  It's not the fastest, it's old, it doesn't have the biggest drops or flip you upside-down.  And yet it's great.  It's classic.  This is Max's Allegheny Tavern.  I'm sure there's better German food with cuter waitresses somewhere out there that doesn't have the decor aesthetics of your grandma's living room.  But who cares.  This place is just right.\n\nFinal note, I can't speak for the brunch buffet.  I went in there for the buffet once and decided that my money would be better spent on the menu.","This is my favorite restaurant on the Northside, possibly favorite restaurant in all of Pittsburgh.  I tell all my friends that this little restaurant is the best kept secret in Pittsburgh.  Max's is a quaint little German place that always has plenty of seating, even on Friday and Saturday nights.  The service is good.  The food is great, I always end up getting the potato pancakes.  If you are looking for a place to check out that isn't going to be as crowded and will be more \"authentic\" German food than other places you should definitely come to Max's!","German food and German beer served in a mason jar. Best in Pittsburgh. The history of the tavern and the friendly makes this wish me that I lived closer to Max's.","Tremendous selection of German dishes.  All the sausages come from a particular manufacturer in Wisconsin that uses 100 year old methods of making them (according to the menu).  I don't know if that's a good thing or not, but they taste terrific.  \n\nThe options for sides are as plentiful as the moan dishes and the hot bacon potato salad was awesome.  \n\nDefinitely recommend giving this a try.","Crap!  I can't believe that I missed a \"First to Review\" by just a matter of weeks.  Max's Allegheny Tavern has been a shining star and a \"must\" for my Pittsburgh rotation of places to visit.  Years ago, when I worked on the Northside for Heinz, I spent many a rowdy Friday night here in the basement with factory workers.  \n\nWhat's there to say?  It's a Northside institution and always has a mixed crowd that is super cool and friendly.  The bartenders are friendly and manage to remember my name and drink choice even though I'm here only a few times a year.  My Friday nights here must have made quite an impression!  I love the decor here, dark wood paneling with lots of stained glass, and the downstairs bar is where the naughty people hang.  Jukebox and room for dancing.  The food is very homey and very reasonably priced.  The German nachos are always worth ordering, and they are smothered with Gouda cheese.  The spatzle is also a creamy indulgent treat.  And for those seeking the real Deutsch culinary experience, they have a large variety of sausages and schnitzels.  So it's a sausage factory in more ways than one.","5 stars because I accept it for what it is.  Really good German comfort  food with killer drafts.  And the fact that the place has been there for forever makes it super cool.  I love the player piano and put a quarter in every time!  PS. the popcorn at the bar is sooooooooo good too.","Been coming to Max's for years. Very consistent. \n\nFood is always excellent, beer is always cold.\n\nPastrami and Swiss was great, but the meal of pork and apple/raisin sauce was out of this world.","Excellent German food.  I went in for an early lunch, the service was great.  Had a whole feast of great dishes.  The best sauerkraut i've ever had -- subtle, with caraway.  Sweet and sour cabbage, potato salad, spaetzle, a great weisswurst, and a great wheat beer on tap.","Best place in town. I love the sampler platter and Sunday brunch is the best deal in town"],"type":["Low Rating","Low Rating","Medium Rating","Medium Rating","Medium Rating","Medium Rating","Medium Rating","Medium

hotel and not really having eaten much all day, I was hungry.\n\nThe service was terrible....no one knew what they were doing so it took 10 minutes to get a freaking slice of pizza and then when said pizza came it was NASTY.\n\nMy husband once got a pizza in Milwaukee where they put Kraft singles on it as cheese and Pizza Parma is just behind that for worst pizza ever.","Looking for a quick bite to eat and a local told me this was \"the best pizza in the city.\"  I got a plain slice and a pepperoni slice. Possibly the worst pizza I have ever eaten.  This wouldn't even qualify as pizza in North Jersey.  I ate half of the plain slice because I was starving....then threw both in the garbage.  \n\nIf this is really the best pizza in Pittsburgh... wow.","I ordered from Pizza Parma out of storm necessity. I ordered a chicken parmigiana \"hoagie\", which was dry and luke warm. The potato bacon soup was like something out of a can, except the chunks of potato were hard and undercooked..all pretty nasty and overly salty.\n\nNever order from them.","Zero stars. Came in 10 mins before close. Female manager on duty asked for $100 in exchange for a pizza. When we refused she said she could not serve us because her employees had been working since 9am..,it is currently 2:00 am... Sounds pretty illegal to me","Average pizza. But with ten guys working - and not much business at the moment - it still took twenty minutes to get a slice of pepperoni. I'll walk across the street next time.","My butthole hasn't been right for days, nor my stomach. \n\nWe ordered in because we all had a long day and were set to have a family movie night.\n\nA pizza and hoagie. \n\nThe hoagie wasn't anything to run and go scream from the rooftops about but the pizza was covered in little ass ruining intestinal demons and this I am nearly sure of.\n\nI had to be talked out of sending pizza Parma a bill for several rolls of toilet paper.\n\nBe weary of the pizza, distrustful actually.\n\nYour butthole will thank me for it!","Hubby and I dropped in after a hellish morning at the Social Security office. Hubby loves pizza so we made a stop.\n\nPizza wan't bad, it was actually pretty decent. But the place was disgusting and the cashier was incredibly rude.","I eat this pizza all the time when downtown, usually when running around at events like First Night or the Gallery Crawls...not the best pizza I have ever had in my life, but it's not bad!  And I haven't ever gotten sick from it.  Just wanted to offer a different opinion.","PIzza Parma's decent tasting mega-big-2ft-long hot sausage hoagie was let down by the piss poor attitude of the staff, the lack of cleanliness of the tables and floor, the out-of-order red door restroom, the bright yellow for no-explicable reason walls. \n\nThe large color-striped 80's retro tables and green chairs have come back in style but this win is purely accidental and achieved only by laziness and lack of renovation.\n\nThat is all.","My fiance & I have lived in downtown Pittsburgh for over a year + now & this place is fabulous. \nMy sweetie LOVES LOVES LOVESSS pizza & we order from here a ton.  We haven't ordered anything here that wasn't super tasty.\nThe shop is small & the decor is super bright which makes you want to get in & out quickly but who the hell eats in there anyways. ... you're grabbing your order & running.","I'm glad I listened to my friend's recommendation and not some of these bad reviews. We're just in town for the night and wanted something delivered to our hotel. They said it would take an hour, which I expected on Super Bowl Sunday right at game time, but it was here in less than half an hour. \n\nThe pizza was delicious! Just the right balance of cheese and a tasty sauce, generous with the toppings, and a nicely crispy crust but not too thin.","This place has great service! My best friend and I got 2 custom orders and the older guy in back came out to the register to take our orders personally.  I assume he's either the cook, owner, or both. We ordered 2 cheeselss pizzas; a lot of places mess this up. Pizza Parma however, makes great cheeseless pizza. Our personal pizzas were nice and toasty, not over nor undercooked, and it was not dried out at all! There was more than enough sauce mmmmmmmmm.","My fiance & I have lived in downtown Pittsburgh for over a year + now & this place is fabulous. \nMy sweetie LOVES LOVES LOVESSS pizza & we order from here a ton.

waiter was to be found about ten minutes later they gave us our water and left again! It wasn't even busy! There were only TWO dim sum carts floating around somewhere. Then our waiter finally came around and took our orders of lunch entrees. The food was not even that good as the reviews that are posted on here. When we came up to pay, the bill was super overpriced. I will not be returning here, I am better off eating at Great Wall Cuisine.","If this place had zero stars I would have given them that ! Let me start off by saying I was so excited to read all great reviews so maybe I just came in on a off day? We walked in and were seated came over and asked if we wanted water or tea I guess they don't serve anything Else, Then we placed an order pork dumplings and sticky rice nasty! Then I asked if they served egg rolls they said they were out!!! they pushed their little carts around with hot plates that basically steam the food and is not fresh and what you get is soggy poor customer service we had to get up and look for someone to give us our tab so we could get the heck out of there are get some real food. It looked like it would be a great place for groups of people would not recommend if you are on mission for what you want and want to place an order but it could be a fun experience for some people.","You walk into a Chinese restaurant on a Saturday afternoon for dim sum and you expect the place to be PACKED.  Well, walking in to a pretty much empty dining room, it's a VERY CLEAR SIGN.  But my friend insisted and I was very hesitant for good reasons.  Another indicator, the majority of the patrons were NON Asian.  \n\nFood: You walk in and you see carts of the food by the entrance to the dining room.  Umm, I thought dim sum should come right off the steamer and into the carts and they roll it around, not sitting around.  The dim sum was garbage.  It had the typical selection, but at minimum.  \n\nService: It's ok.  But it doesn't make up for the horrible food.\n\nBottom line: NO WAY!  Stay away!","I've been here many times...Mother's Day with family, dim sum with book club, etc. But I will not go back again.  I stopped in to ask the owner about a donation or reduced price for a class of under-privileged kids that I volunteer with.  His reaction was to scoff and shoo me out the door while handing me his card and saying I could email him.  He turned his back and headed off to the messy newspaper-strewn table he haunts between guests arrivals.  Maybe he's a community-minded business owner, but then again, maybe he's not.  I'll be dining elsewhere.","Being from Chicago, we are used to getting authentic Chinese food all the time.  But when we first starting spending a lot of time in Scottsdale/Phoenix, we found it a challenge to get authentic Chinese food.  We were excited to find the Golden Buddha and have made many trips over the years all the way from the Troon North area to get our fix.  However, service has declined to the point where it is no longer worth the aggravation.  We went there last night for Chinese New Year and will never go back.  Granted they were very busy because of a lot of large tables there, but waiting almost an hour to get our food is not acceptable under any circumstance!  45 mins. into our wait, the waitress came back (after we flagged her down to ask about our food) and said one of the dishes we ordered was not available....after 45 mins.!!!! What makes the whole experience an unforgivable one is that the manager/owner is so indifferent and never apologized or offered a discount off the bill...nothing.  When we left, the same manager was at the piano singing in Chinese. Huh?  Other than Nee House in Scottsdale, the search goes on for a restaurant that serves authentic Chinese food closer to home.","I will NEVER go there again.  I reserved a table for a group of 16 people for 5:00 PM on Christmas Eve .  The person on the phone ( I believe the manager) repeatedly asked me to call ahead and give him an accurate head count since he said they'd be swamped that day.  I followed up with him twice.  \nWhen the first couple of us arrived, we had menus shoved in our faces immediately and told we \"Must order now.  Must order now\" because they were going to be busy later on.  The place was practically empty.  As each person arrived, they were treated the same way. \nWe rushed and placed our orders and then they brought out our checks WAY before we saw any sign of our food.  I have never in my life been treated so rudely by a restaurant.\nIt was utter chaos when the food started coming out while everyone struggled to get the correct dish they ordered.  One person didn't get her food until we were all just about finished eating. \nOne top of all that, the food wasn't even good.  I've had better Kung Pao Chicken at Panda Express!\nAfter being rushed through our meal, the place wasn't even half full by the time we left.  I thought being at the Cultural Center, this restaurant would be a sure thing but boy was I wrong.  Lovely way to spend Christmas Eve..","If you are looking a chinese restaurant to host a big party look some other than the Golden Buddah.  I recently attended a banquet at the Golden Buddah and I was shocked at the level of quality of food and service.  Of the 10 dishes served 4 were nearly inedible.  \n\nThere was a crab claw appetizer, most chinese restaurants prepare this dish by taking a crab claw surrounding it with ground shrimp, batter and then deep fry.  At Golden Buddah, the crab claw served was mostly batter.  \n\nThe shark fin soup served was mostly broth.  Shark fin is an expensive ingredient and most places usually use imitation shark fin, but come on at least put something in there so that I know I'm eating soup and not dirty sink water.  \n\nGinger scallion lobster is battered, fried, and then stir fried in a sauce with ginger and scallions.  The ginger scallion lobster served was over-cooked and dried out.  \n\nLastly, there was a steamed fish.  The fish was raw in the middle.   \n\nIt wasn't all bad, there was a crispy chicken with garlic dish that was pretty good, but out of 10 dishes 4 were bad, 5 were okay, and 1 was good.  \n\nDoes 4 bad dishes out of 10 warrant a one star rating?  Well it does when you factor in the service.  The soup, appetizer, and first entree arrived timely, but after that there was a 1 hour gap before we received the next dish.  The dishes were not served with accompanying white rice which I thought was odd.  We had to ask for it, and even the rice took a while to arrive.","I agree with Crystal C., that the dim sum isn't the greatest I've ever had. In fact, I am not sure if the meal was so tasty that it was memorable. I do remember the \"calamari\" was not really calamari, like you would think. It was presented more like a sweet and sour pork (so calamari with LOTS of breading) without any sauce. As a result, the dish was dry and salty.\n\nThe sticky rice was good (hard to mess up), the chicken feet were okay (needed more five spice powder), and the shumai was alright. The noodles were good, and I can see why the cart ran out after the first round. The diners were an equal mix of Asians and Americans. I would've preferred to see more Asians eating (as I am used to in a Chinatown and gives an indication of authenticity), but I do realize we're in Phoenix where the Asian population is not like San Francisco or Houston. \n\nThe meal came to about $30 for two, including jasmine tea. The carts are loud because they are made out of metal and roll on tile. I am also not used to staff members shouting what they have in their cart, like a newspaper boy yelling \"Extra! Extra!\" Christmas music was playing after mid-January, so the atmosphere felt strange. Next time I visit the city, I probably will pass.","Can't say that I was very impressed. Came for dinner in a hopeful and enthusiastic mood since the reviews have been pretty good, but I don't think this place lives up to its current good, but declining rating.\n\nOrdered the Combo fried rice (shrimp, chicken, beef, pork), sesame chicken, and garlic fried chicken. \n\nThe combo fried rice was pretty good, but ended up drinking about 6 glasses of water due to the MSG and sodium content. You'd think that the cook spent his better years in the French Foreign Legion in the Sahara eating salt tablets and developed a taste for them. \n\nThe sesame chicken had a good flavor and a thick brown sweet sauce. I liked it a lot until it got cool and the sauce looked (with that stringy consistency) more like glue. You think I'm kidding? I'm not.\n\nGarlic fried chicken was bad. Just bad. It was like an over roasted dried out half chicken with some dried garlic pieces sprinkled on top. No spices, no flavor, no good. \n\nWe then got all kinds of lip from the waitress when we asked if they could change the channel on the TV from college football, to the Suns game. They made it into this big deal that the \"customers\" wanted to see the football game. Yeah right, it was University of West Virginia Vs. University of Connecticut! I would have believed it if it was a local team....\n\nIt's better than a 1 star joint, but only because it's borderline edible. To be avoided.","This restaurant is located in the Chinese Cultural Center and was the one restaurant that I had not been to. So after some shopping at one of the shops, we stepped in to have dinner.\n\nWe stepped in and asked for a seat for two. We were seated immediately. The place was decorated nicely and a lady playing the piano made for great ambiance.\n\nWe looked at the menu briefly and ordered our drinks, an appetizer, a soup and two main dishes. The drinks came out promptly and so did the rest of the meal. My goodness everything we ordered was very tasty.\n\nThe waiter service itself however was not even close to the decor and food. He never introduced himself, and although he took our order, our food itself was brought out by a kitchen person.\n\nAfter we ordered our waiter really never came back asking if we needed anything else, except to give us our check at the end and that was after the person I was dining with got up and asked a different waiter for it.\n\nIt's amazing how a place with great food, decor, and ambiance can mess it all up by crappy waiter service.","I love Dim Sum, my favorite Chinese dish.\n\nWhen Golden Buddha first open, they have excellent Dim sum. I went there many times, I tell my friend how good it is, But now,  they change cook, taste more like  week old left over. Rumor has it, they change cook every few month, so Quality of cooking change. (not sure if that is true, but that is what I was told.)\nMy advice is; when you walk in the door and the place is pack, = Good Cook. if the place is bare = bad cook. leave immediately. don't waste your money.","If you just \"want\" dim sum, go here. If you are \"craving\" dim sum, go elsewhere (take a 5 hour drive west to neighboring state, California).\n\nAnyway, I've been visiting Golden Buddha in the noontime for roughly 2 years now. I believe they moved from their original site (7th St. & Osborn), formerly \"China Doll.\" Relocation brought along better atmosphere and smiling faces. This does not mean, better dim sum. But since we are in Phoenix, I will settle for what they have to offer. \n\nBe mindful of the dim sum tab. It's itemized high-medium-low. \n\nShaomai can be found as combinations of pork/mushroom, shrimp, or shark fin (which should not be confused as true shark bits, as the shaomai is prepared to look like a shark's fin). These picks are okay...perhaps on a better day shao mai will be served in less-rigid, or fresher wrappers. Potstickers are okay as well, just the usual scallion and pork, and dry wrapper. The baby pork ribs in light black bean sauce and jalapenos is alright, but sometimes lacks in taste. Tripe is also served in its bare minimum...so if you enjoy the texture and flavor of tripe, try this with its clear sauce and thinly sliced carrots and celery.  \nBuche (that's what I call it), or fried sesame balls are also available, although if you wait until dessert, they will also be a bit stiff. There are a few other things that may be \"spotted\" but are not worth mentioning. \n\nDon't order from their lunch menu, as you can find these over-salted dishes at Panda Express anyway. \n\nOverall, dim sum at Golden Buddha is a place to go if you are around the vicinity and feel like having something apart from the usual fast food. However, discriminating palates- beware.","Not impressed with this place at all. This was not the friendliest place around, maybe because of the language barrier (most or all were clearly native Chinese speakers), or maybe just the attitude of the employees.\n\nI ordered the sweet and sour chicken lunch, which came with the typical egg drop soup, crab rangoon, and egg roll. The soup was ok - maybe it's just me, but I prefer a real spoon to the scoop that they gave me. The egg roll was tiny and not that great, and the crab rangoon was ok, but maybe a little undercooked. The chicken wasn't bad, but nothing special, as was the rice and other stuff on the plate.\n\nOverall, this was just not my kind of Chinese place.","Disappointing.  Mediocre at best.  I am staying at the Aloft hotel in phoenix and ordered some delivery. I ordered a couple american chinese food staples: general tso's chicken, dumplings and hot&sour soup.  Soup had zero flavor, dumplings tasted freezer burned and processed.  General tso chicken was ehh. \n\nA lot of good reviews on here so it must be for eat in and for their dim sum.  Don't order delivery, you will be left hungry and unsatisfied.","Went there on Saturday for early lunch.  My wife did the dim sum, it was okay, we were both disgusted by the sugar cane shrimp; but the rest was good.  \n\nI ordered the chicken szechwuan, the waitress warned me it was \"spicy\" the reason I ordered it.  It came out delicious, but not what I would call spicy.  Overall its hard to find good Chinese in the valley and I would call this good without hesitation.","So I was referred to this place from the front desk of my hotel. I'm from SF so I'm coming from a place with really good chinese food. \n\nThe dim sum is just \"ok\" nothing for me to write home about. The one dish that I really liked was the chinese broccoli cooked with garlic sauce. Yum yum yum.  It's in a big bowl, not oily, not saucy, just really good. I think it's $7.50.  \n\nIt's a somewhat pricey and just like all chinese restaurants, it's not the cleanest.  The chair was filthy.  the dishes weren't all that great.  I wouldn't go back unless I want the chinese broccoli.  \n\nSo I went on a Sunday and it was not crowded at all. There's not a huge asian population  in Phoenix (not that I could tell) so I don't think there's a high demand for dim sum.  And also, I sooooooo felt like taking a pic of this, but a Mexican lady was pushing one of the dim sum carts. That is unheard of in SF.  This is a mainly mandarin restaurant and the dim sum places I go are usually cantonese.  Not a big deal though since the dishes look the same. \n\nDude, there was a turtle in the fish tank that I saw as I left.  I hope they don't eat that!","A Premier Chinese Atmosphere,\nThe Chinese cultural center and Asian Garden produces an Asain atmosphere that can be recognized from the 202.  \n With Dim Sum served this location earns its respect from the local community.\n\nDim Sum tip,  You have to be smart with the Dim Sum ladies they look nice innocent but they are professional sales people that will sell you more dishes than you need before you know what to do.  \n\nI love the desserts here ask the server to see the dessert tray.","This restaurant has a bit of an identity crisis. It is in the Chinese cultural center, but serves Japanese beer (Kirin on tap!) and the live piano music is American pop. We had to ask for chopsticks.\n\nHaving said that, the service was professional. Our waiter held a hot appetizer for one of our party who was away from the table so that it would not be cold when he returned. We were asked frequently--and not too frequently--if things were ok both by our waiter and the manager/proprietor.\n\nThe food was ok-to-good. Fried shrimp egg rolls were dainty but yummy. Duck was tasty but very chewy. Kung-pao chicken was pleasantly spiced. Plenty of rice. A pitcher of ice water with lemon was left at the table. \n\nAtmosphere was also pleasant. Chairs comfortable, tables spaced well, restrooms large and clean...and there is indeed a large golden Buddha by the entrance.","I took a group of friends here and relatives other times. The place is consistently good for Dim-sum during lunch. It is typical Chinese and nothing fancy.\n\nWhat helps this place is the moat scenery.  3 stars for visiting here based on convenience since there are similar places in town.","Having grown up in Hong Kong and having eaten dim sum in London, NY, LA, SF and Vancouver (actually Richmond), I can confidently say I know my dim sum.\n\nGood selection of well-executed dim sum when the carts actually come around and there's anything left in it.  I'd give it 4 stars for food but the wait definitely detracted from the whole experience.\n\nI think the problem with Golden Buddha is that they can't handle the heavy flow on weekends.  There's not enough regular dim sum eaters like LA that can sustain a steady flow of diners throughout the week, forcing restaurants like Golden Buddha to depend heavily on extra part-time help on weekends.  \n\nDim sum takes serious skill so the chef still ends up doing most of the work.  When we looked into the kitchen, we saw a Chinese woman doing most of the cooking herself.  No wonder it took forever for a cart to come out and when it does, it's swarmed on by a pack of vultures.\n\nIf you're willing to eat at a more simply decorated place with a smaller menu, I'd highly recommend China Chan.  It's much more relaxed - usually no wait on weekends.  An experienced chef makes all the dim sum himself so the menu's much shorter but all the classics are on it.  Anything steamed is made to order so is very fresh.","Situated in the Chinese Cultural Center near the SkyHarbor Airport, this was another pleasant find. All I had was the Dim Sum menu, and I would say this is the best you're gonna get in Phoenix. Still worth the stop to get your Dim Sum fix. The cart ladies were pleasant and very happy to converse with me in Cantonese. Only downside was the chicken sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaves, naw mei gai, was way overcooked, and mushy.","Do you want to eat Chinese Food in an elegant environment on a Friday night in Phoenix? \n\nBe entertained by classic, quiet standards being played live on a piano while you dine?\n\nAre you 50 years old and Caucasian?\n\nThen the Golden Buddha is the place for you! \n\nIts in the Chinese Cultural Center Mall on 44th, and a popular weekend spot for Dim Sum. For a DIm Sum starved Valley of the Sun, Golden Buddha's is decent. \n\nFor dinner, though, it is awfully Americanized and not very authentic Chinese. But with a bunch of American customers coming for dinner, what do you expect? They probably think they are getting \"real Chinese\" food by going to the Chinese Mall, but then again, they are used to PF Chang's or Stix normally in their neighborhood, so this is a step up.\n\nThe best thing about this place is the decor, which is clean and nice, with a Hong Kong Junk boat design covering the ceiling from the bar into the dining room. The next best thing is the Piano interludes on weekend nights. The service is next, which is a little overly eager to remove your plate, and the last thing is the food. \n\nThey do give decent portions. I ordered Guo Teh (potstickers) and got 6 fat ones. But they weren't served with the usual soy, chili oil and vinegar, but a soy and green onions mixture. The Mapo Tofu was ok, as they used a nice silky tofu, which was nice, but no green onions, and sliced black mushrooms instead, which I like, but not in this dish.\n\nCome here for the ambiance and music in the evenings, or on the weekend days for Dim Sum.","Decent dim sum, especially to be found in the middle of the desert. Sadly, the best food I've had in Phoenix.","This place is a little difficult for me to review.  I was staying at the Hampton Inn across the street and this is the closest restaurant so off I went.\n\nI walked in and the owner or manager met me at the door and asked \"how many\"?\n\nI told him I wanted to order take out and handed me a menu and pointed to the waiting area which was covered in newspapers.  I chose to go to the bar, order a glass of wine, and peruse the menu.\n\nThe drinks are expensive but I didn't think the food was.  Less than $10 for my Mongolian Chicken which came with white sticky rice and a fortune cookie.  When ordering I asked if I could have fried rice instead of white rice but was told \"no\".  Most places allow this for a nominal fee.\n\nFine by me.  Give the white rice.  Food was prepared and their to-go boxes were a lot better than the standard white Chinese \"to go\" boxes.  They also included the plastic-ware, napkin, and soy sauce, which a lot of places forget.\n\nLooking around I found a whole lot of goodness along with a couple disappointments.  Most notably the newspaper strewn about and behind the bar, to the right were a lot of boxes stacked in an unsightly fashion.  I could have been a little more presentable in my opinion.\n\nI peeked into the dining room because I wanted to see if the piano music was piped in or live.  It was live which was very nice. Also, the dinning room looked very nice and cozy.\n\nAs I was leaving the same man who greeted me upon entering made sure to wish me a good evening.  My initial impression of the man was that he was surly and testy but that's just how he comes off.\n\nThe food was very good.  The Mongolian sauce was mixture of sweet with spice and the chicken and vegetables all tasted fresh.","My husband and I went there Saturday, the service was great!  Our friends were going to be late so they told us to start.  And start we did!\nThey were serving Dim Sum, something we had never tried, so glad we did, it was wonderful, hubby wouldn't do the chicken feet, but I think next time I will, it looked very good.\nOur friends showed up and ordered their food, and ate all of it, they said that usually they take food home, but it was so good they had to eat all of it!\nWe will be going back very soon!","Let's see, over 50... check \nold white man...........check \neats dinner ...............check \nlistens to the piano  check \n\nwow this must be the place for me, I mean after all it is in a Chinese mall, no make that a Chinese Cultural Center. How could I possibly have discerning taste with such trickery to get me here to eat. \nDude if you are going to rate a restaurant no need to degrade others with your arrogance. \nFool is my review of wanugee N. \n\nNow on the restaurant. The last time we were here the food was not good, the piano was too loud and the waitress had a real attitude. IT won't keep me from going back as I have had good meals and wait service too. \n\nBack to wanugee N. I do not expect any place in Phx. to have authentic Chinese food, by that I mean the street food one finds in China. \nBut I do expect what I fork in to my mouth is worth what I am going to fork over in cost. Even an old white guy like me can tell the difference between good and bad food. No matter what it is called.","Okay so Ive been glum the past few days as I have an impending birthday. Every year this time I get all down in the dumps.. not that I'm not happy with my life cause life is good. Its more like getting further away from my youth and closer to being well, old. All of my grandparents were crotchety, sourpuss drama queens.. is that my fate? Can I break the mold or am I to going to be a crotchety sourpuss?\n\nSo as I contemplate and figure out what I'm going to do with my birthday baggage I decide to squash it with food. All weekend Ive been eating out and having a good time. This is one of the few times outside of a vacation where I will live it completely and to the near of sheer gluttony. So why not dim sum? \n\nIve chowed much dim sum in my 36 years of earthen wear.. of course some good and some bad. I have never been to a place where every dish was great.. Golden Buddha is no exception to this.. they do the basics well enough and have enough funky cool Asian style to keep me interested in returning. The carts around 1130 flow well but around noon it' s full blown freeway action! In fact there might be some road kill in there based on some of the looks on that last steam cart.. \n\nMe and 3 others who were feeling my pain ordered 14, count them, 14 different dishes. One of my friends is from Georgia and had never had dim sum but he is so courageous and unflinching that he was just a blast. Just the shot in the arm to get me out of my funk. I remember the first time I had dim sum.. my eyes wide open, nostrils flared and excited to see what was under the next steamer lid. That was him today.. one exciting thing after the next.. he was even willing to try chicken feet but this is one of those dishes not done very well here. \n\nMy friend took me back to a time where I was younger and less experienced. He looked up to me to guide him through the noodles, bao and sui mai.. like a big brother.. I'm privileged that I could show him something new and exciting and he was so into it! So instead of feeling sorry for myself I felt experienced and useful.. that there is something I can give back to others.. that its not all about me and me aging but about what can be shared with others.\n\nThere is so much more to do, give and feel in this short time we are here.. and Ill do it to, one bite at a time.","The best to be found in land locked Arizona.  My favorite sticky rice is here.  They have dim sum every day, but not a huge selection, though you can order off the menu.  I think it is much bigger on the weekends.  I'm just happy I can get my fix 7 days a week.  Beautiful gardens to walk through, with fish ponds, and a 99 market next door!","I ate at Golden Buddha a few weeks ago.  We ate at the restaurant after a day at the zoo with our 4 year old and had a blast.  The piano bar played tunes for my daughter and the staff was more than accommodating.  The general tso chicken was better than anything I can get in Tucson.  The soup was chocked full of fresh, read FRESH, not canned, vegetables.  All in all, I was very satisfied with the meal and the service.  Plus the decor is very nice, clean and cheery. \n\nEat at Golden Buddha.","For those who gave this place low marks, forgive me. I really like this place. Now I haven't tried various dim sum places so I'm reserving the right to downgrade the place as needed. The variety of food is plentiful, and the carts just keep on coming. I love the steamed pork buns, and the shiu mai (not sure if I spelled that correctly). Yesterday, my favorite pick was the deep fried rolls of taro and shrimp. YUM! I have never ordered from their menu so I can only talk about their dim sum. My friends and I try to go eat dim sum almost every Sunday. It's a cheap way to try new foods, and if you don't like it, well.. you can get away with pushing it aside with minimal guilt. Give it a try! You might be surprised.","I like Golden Buddha, have taken many friends there for Dim Sum.  \nTry not to \"hit\" the dumpling cart to heavy; otherwise cannot finish it to the dessert cart (LOL).\nLove the jasmine tea and the staff willing to help you if you do not understand the what each item is.\nSingapore Rice Noodles a favorite, along with any of the shrimp dumplings; also the broccoli and green beans.\nOnly wish that the carts with eggplant stuffed with shrimp or green peppers with shrimp were not on \"heated\" carts; by the time it gets to you the food is cold.\nOnly concern is that went on 22MAY2010 at 1:30PM; there was a closed sign due to electricity???\nREVISED: 26MAY2010 - called this evening - looks like they are back open again.","I've been to the Golden Buddha on several occasions and it is my favorite, by far, for honest Chinese food. \nWhile I've sampled everything from their vegetarian to their beef, I love their mandarin chicken. More recently, I was delighted to relive the wonders of their Kung Pao Chicken and Beef with Broccoli. \nI absolutely love the egg drop soup and mini crab rangoons that come with the meal.","The very first time I went to Golden Buddha was with my BFF and it was our first dim sum experience. Little did I know this would forever change my life and eating experiences. Although I must admit that first time was a bit awkward.\n\nGB wisely takes reservations which was wonderful (even though it wasn't crazy busy). Our assorted dim sum plates were flavorful and fresh. And the carts seemed to be in constant rotation so we were never too far from a good selection.\n\nWhat really helps GB is its location. The Cofco Center is an experience in itself, where one can have herbs specially blended, select a fresh member of marine life to take home and cook or browse through a store with one of the largest selections of Buddhas and hand fans I've experienced outside of San Francisco.","I've been to Golden Buddha a few times and have not been disappointed. \n\nThey have a LARGE selection of Dim Sum and if you're not careful you can get carried away.\n\nTry and get there early and you'll get the best and most fresh selection.\nMake sure you walk around the garden when you're done.","Probably the most comprehensive Chinese menu in the Valley.  Pick from well over 100 dishes, but if you want the best order the Peking Duck.  Everything else is very good, but without a wow factor.  You'll see lots of Chinese people in this massive restaurant, which probably means they're doing a fine job in the kitchen.","I very much enjoyed eating here. Food was great. Fairly fast service. Wasn't expensive either for the 4 of us.","Golden Buddha has GREAT dim sum.  Their prices are reasonable and the staff is very polite wheeling their little carts.  I tend to go on the weekend because there is more selection but they do dim sum throughout the week.  They also have some very authentic dishes on the menu for those who are more of the adventurous types.  Be sure to say hello to the turtles the next time you go.","This place in the Chinese Cultural Center has a very pretty and elegant bar area. I was pleased to learn that they had some very reasonable and delicious happy hour snacks. This is a good place for a Pina Colada. I had one by myself along with some dumplings and fried shrimp appetizer. Sadly I never brought anyone else here with me. It was happy hour heaven but you know? A lot of my friends in AZ pretty much hang out in one neighborhood or another and nobody I know really lives close to the Buddha.\nThe airport is pretty close by. This might be a good pre-flight send-off location.","I have had dim sum in New Orleans and Phoenix (not SF), and this is about equal to the best of New Orleans as far as flavor.\nAs for ambiance, today was a good day. I've had dim sum here about a dozen times, and have had very good service and quality 90% of the time, including weekends. I have had bad days here, but since today was good, I'll rate accordingly. It's closer to a 4.5, but since I can't give half-stars, I rounded up.\nDon't expect me to give these the right names, but... I was less than impressed with the bbq pork balls. They tasted too much like honey and the beef was minimal. The bbq sauce tasted bottled. Outside of that, their herbal hot tea is delicious even on a hot day.\nThe shu mai were very good, and the shrimp in a spinach dumpling was fantastic. A definite don't miss is their sticky rice in lotus leaf. It's among the best I've had anywhere. Just be careful; you'll find bones in it every once in a while. Go for any of their steamed dumplings; they're very flavorful. As others have said, I love the Chinese broccoli, but you'll only find it on the carts on weekends. Otherwise order it off the menu.\nToday (11:30 lunch) the carts came around often, and everything except the pork buns was piping hot and fresh. By the way, despite the price increases, even the sticky rice was considered a medium size entree, and the two of us eating there escaped with a bill under $20 and we were done in under 30 minutes.\nI strongly recommend the dim sum here, whether you've had it a million times or have never had it before. You usually won't be disappointed.","I don't really understand the poor reviews on this place.....maybe it depends on the day you go? We went on a Sunday, it was crazy busy, but service was great! (of course, my view of customer service is a little different then the rest... I used to live on an island where you were just happy to find what you were looking for, let alone expect good customer service) Anyways, our server was very sweet! Always had a smile on her face. The carts served us promplty and none of the food was cold. They always had whatever we wanted (I hate having to wait for the next cart).\n\nNow, as for the actual dim sum and food.......holy cow, to die for! So flavorful and fresh!! The broccoli makes you sing...and the wine noodles, make you cry. You leave with very weird mixed emotions, but mostly a happy belly full of yummy food.\n\nIn my opinion, this is the best dim sum I have been able to find in Phx. I'm ditching my previous spot (Mekong Palace) and will be back to Golden Buddha when the dim sum monster strikes again!"],"type":["Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low

hotel and not really having eaten much all day, I was hungry.\n\nThe service was terrible....no one knew what they were doing so it took 10 minutes to get a freaking slice of pizza and then when said pizza came it was NASTY.\n\nMy husband once got a pizza in Milwaukee where they put Kraft singles on it as cheese and Pizza Parma is just behind that for worst pizza ever.","Looking for a quick bite to eat and a local told me this was \"the best pizza in the city.\"  I got a plain slice and a pepperoni slice. Possibly the worst pizza I have ever eaten.  This wouldn't even qualify as pizza in North Jersey.  I ate half of the plain slice because I was starving....then threw both in the garbage.  \n\nIf this is really the best pizza in Pittsburgh... wow.","I ordered from Pizza Parma out of storm necessity. I ordered a chicken parmigiana \"hoagie\", which was dry and luke warm. The potato bacon soup was like something out of a can, except the chunks of potato were hard and undercooked..all pretty nasty and overly salty.\n\nNever order from them.","Zero stars. Came in 10 mins before close. Female manager on duty asked for $100 in exchange for a pizza. When we refused she said she could not serve us because her employees had been working since 9am..,it is currently 2:00 am... Sounds pretty illegal to me","Average pizza. But with ten guys working - and not much business at the moment - it still took twenty minutes to get a slice of pepperoni. I'll walk across the street next time.","My butthole hasn't been right for days, nor my stomach. \n\nWe ordered in because we all had a long day and were set to have a family movie night.\n\nA pizza and hoagie. \n\nThe hoagie wasn't anything to run and go scream from the rooftops about but the pizza was covered in little ass ruining intestinal demons and this I am nearly sure of.\n\nI had to be talked out of sending pizza Parma a bill for several rolls of toilet paper.\n\nBe weary of the pizza, distrustful actually.\n\nYour butthole will thank me for it!","Hubby and I dropped in after a hellish morning at the Social Security office. Hubby loves pizza so we made a stop.\n\nPizza wan't bad, it was actually pretty decent. But the place was disgusting and the cashier was incredibly rude.","I eat this pizza all the time when downtown, usually when running around at events like First Night or the Gallery Crawls...not the best pizza I have ever had in my life, but it's not bad!  And I haven't ever gotten sick from it.  Just wanted to offer a different opinion.","PIzza Parma's decent tasting mega-big-2ft-long hot sausage hoagie was let down by the piss poor attitude of the staff, the lack of cleanliness of the tables and floor, the out-of-order red door restroom, the bright yellow for no-explicable reason walls. \n\nThe large color-striped 80's retro tables and green chairs have come back in style but this win is purely accidental and achieved only by laziness and lack of renovation.\n\nThat is all.","My fiance & I have lived in downtown Pittsburgh for over a year + now & this place is fabulous. \nMy sweetie LOVES LOVES LOVESSS pizza & we order from here a ton.  We haven't ordered anything here that wasn't super tasty.\nThe shop is small & the decor is super bright which makes you want to get in & out quickly but who the hell eats in there anyways. ... you're grabbing your order & running.","I'm glad I listened to my friend's recommendation and not some of these bad reviews. We're just in town for the night and wanted something delivered to our hotel. They said it would take an hour, which I expected on Super Bowl Sunday right at game time, but it was here in less than half an hour. \n\nThe pizza was delicious! Just the right balance of cheese and a tasty sauce, generous with the toppings, and a nicely crispy crust but not too thin.","This place has great service! My best friend and I got 2 custom orders and the older guy in back came out to the register to take our orders personally.  I assume he's either the cook, owner, or both. We ordered 2 cheeselss pizzas; a lot of places mess this up. Pizza Parma however, makes great cheeseless pizza. Our personal pizzas were nice and toasty, not over nor undercooked, and it was not dried out at all! There was more than enough sauce mmmmmmmmm.","My fiance & I have lived in downtown Pittsburgh for over a year + now & this place is fabulous. \nMy sweetie LOVES LOVES LOVESSS pizza & we order from here a ton.

This place didn't even deserve a star! I order 1 sandwich and it took 20min to make and this was at 4:26pm they where not busy. When I got the sandwich (number 11) it only had TWO Slices of meat and a tons of carrots. This place has gone to the dumps the only thing health about this place is your jaw gets a workout from chewing the hard French bread! I'd rather go to subway and I hate subway. I'll never go here again.\n\n***Look at every French roll sandwich picture and you can see the amount of meat if you can see the meat at all!***","I would give it zero star if I could because of food safety reason. My husband and I went here for brunch. He ordered a grilled pork banh mi stuffed with some suspiciously bright-colored meat, pickled veggies, and raw cilantro. I got a breakfast sandwich with cooked eggs, ham, and cheese on croissant. Later that day, my husband started to feel sick - lack of appetite, light headed, and slight diarrhea. The diarrhea was getting much worse that night and the symptoms lasted for 2 days after we put him on anti-diarrhea medicines. We believe it was due to food poisoning from the banh mi since we ate otherwise the same food that day. We had banh mi regularly in other places and we never had any issue. This place charged less for a reason. I feel grossly sick when I think about the who-knows-what meat like stuff and RAW veggies. Beware of the food safety issues here!","Mediocre sandwiches.  To much bread and only a small amount of meat.  They don't even taste good at all, nothing special about them.  The Thai tea here is good and I've heard the same about the coffees, but I won't be eating here again.","I ordered a #2 pork roll sandwich.   I nearly chipped/broke my tooth biting into it.  Sandwich was hard as a rock.  \nVery disappointing compared to California's lee sandwiches.","Very good/cheap Vietnamese sandwiches..I wouldn't call it fast food...more like painfully slow...I think there is one guy preparing all the food :-/...it's cash only but I'd advise not to use their ATM..it only gave me $20 but debted me $60...when I asked the guy who I saw refilling the machine he waived me off and told me to go to the cashier..I was ready to call the cops!","Service is always great and fast. Food is cheap! Coming from Hawaii and LA, I have been exposed to some pretty darn good Vietnamese sandwiches that feature fried tofu. So being that I've relocated here, this was the only place so far that has authentic Vietnamese style sandwiches. I've had the vegetarian one quite a few times, and although I am super happy with it in general, it does not have slabs of BBQ tofu as I'm used to... I wish it did!! With out a juicy tofu inside, this vege sandwich tends to be dry and lacking the kick and the fillings that I'm used to getting in Hawaii and LA. I get the feeling like Arizona is not a tofu happy place. I very rarely see it on menus as I do in Hawaii and LA. :( I think this sandwich would be killer if they used real pieces of BBQ'd tofu. I'm still happy to go there and get a sandwich since its the only Vietnamese place that offers a vege Vietnamese sandwich that I could find.","The bread was very good.   The sandwich (pastrami) was just average.\n\nPrices are all reasonable and a pretty large menu.  I'm guessing  (hoping)  some of the asian sandwiches  rise above average.\n\nProbably  a 3.5.","Loved the veggie summer rolls though a bit highly priced. The BBQ pork sandwich is good because I don't like pate and most other places put pate. I was let down to find out later i was charged 30 cent for jalape\u00f1os and they didn't say anything.","As a Southern Californian, I wouldn't go to Lee's Sandwiches because there are just so many better and even cheaper Banh mi joints. However, in AZ, the options are pretty limited. Definitely helped curb my Banh mi cravings but the sandwiches were seriously skimpy. The mint milk was not minty at all but the fresh pressed nuoc mia (sugar cane juice)  was super refreshing.","I had their pork sandwich and it was very flavorful but there was a lot of fat that you have to work around.","\"Fresh\" Hot Baguette, Croissant!!  OMG \nBut when their are not fresh is like regular bread in the market \nRecently try salami sandwich and don't remember pork one excellent","One bite of the jambon and pate sandwich and I'm taken back to the summers I spent in France as a college kid. Excellent baguettes and great French-style sandwiches. I walk out after lunch wondering where my backpack and Eurail pass are...\n\nWish they were open late enough to grab a bite on the way home after a long day at work.","If you like good, fresh, sandwiches, then you have to try one here at Lee's. I think the bread is what really makes the difference, it is super fresh and would taste good all by itself! Its much cheaper than any other sandwich shop and definitely seems fresher and less assembly line. I think the only thing that can be hit or miss here is the service from time to time, but that is soon forgotten with a sniff of the fresh bread.  Yes they do only accept cash but that is as they say, to keep the prices down.  I usually order the ham and turkey club and a water and i get out of there for about 5 bucks.  I also love the fresh baked baguettes...so good!","I can't believe there's now a Lee's Sandwiches within a hop, skip and a jump from me here in Chandler.  I usually get my Viet-Sammy fix at their location in one of the grittiest, seediest parts of SF. \n\nIn fact, I haven't gone in quite some time because I hate that part of the city, so now that they're nearby in Chandler, I'll get my fix while I can, even if their sammies are skinnier than those in sF.  All good though, since for these prices, I can just pig out by eating two.  Talk about changing demographics!!\n\nGood times guaylo!!!","My family and I frequently visit this sandwich shop whenever we're near the area. The shop is clean, tidy, and has plenty of tables for those who are looking for a very casual dining experience. The baguettes and croissants have always been warm and  freshly baked on every single of the visits I have made here. I personally like the Turkey Club and Bacon Sandwich (with your choice of it being on a baguette or croissant) and costs about $6. My only complaint is that there usually isn't very much meat on the sandwich in relation to the bread - oh, well. They also serve ice cream (the vanilla fudge with M&Ms is my favorite), smoothies, and other fun little drinks. The service is usually always very decent as well. \n\nBe sure to bring cash, this place doesn't take credit cards.","This place has a huge area for seating and is generally pretty busy and packed with Asians which is saying that it is a good cheap place to eat.\n\nThe in house baked baguette bread for their sandwich are awesome. My favorite is the bbq pork sandwich with double meat. If you don't get the double meat you are eating almost just bread. Their spring rolls are pretty good and a decent size and their little egg rolls are a good buy. \n\nYou can't beat the prices here for an inexpensive meal.","I mainly come here for the Asian sandwiches #11(combination) and #6(bbq pork) to be exact.  They are delicious and their service is great.  The only thing I am not a fan of is their eggrolls.  They are crispy but they don't have a flavorful impact when you bite into them.","Grilled pork is amazing! I was hesitant in trying the grilled pork but my sister suggested it.  I'm glad I took the chance.  Love the fresh bread.  Smells so yummy!","I enjoy coming here when I'm in the mood for Vietnamese sandwiches. The place is big and always clean. You never have to wait long to get your food. The bread is fresh but I feel that it always cuts the roof of my mouth. So I would recommend getting the grilled pork sandwich. It's my favorite to get because the grilled pork makes the bread soft so it's not as hard to eat. I also enjoy the avocado smoothie and the egg rolls.  The only thing I don't like about this place is that it's cash only. I never carry cash on me so every time I want to eat here I have to go to the ATM","Oh banh mi, how I love the, your pickled veggies and meat, they don't taste like.... Feet? So.... Maybe I'll stick to the actual reviews and not poetry. \n\nI first came here a couple years ago, as a recommendation from a friend. I usually get the chicken banh mi, and a vegetarian one and put it in the freezer (for later on that night TBH). The mayo and bread are so good, I would recommend getting here earlier for really fresh bread. And beware, I've gotten a mouth full of jalape\u00f1o midway through the sandwich, which was mildly amusing to my date.\n\nALSO. Cash only! They do have an ATM inside though, in case of emergency.y","Love the BBQ pork sandwich!","This place has great bread. Their baguettes are nice and crunchy.  Their sandwiches are reasonably priced . Their meat portions are a little small I recommend maybe an upgrade but they add picked vegetables and some jalape\u00f1os to make a very tasty.i sandwich. Their croissant are some of the best in town the only drawback they only accept cash service can sometimes be a little slow","Usually really tastes sandwiches. The CS is lacking, but the bakery is the best. \nAlso, they only accept cash$$$","4 for the incredible fresh baguettes made there. Fab $1 bins for day old bread, and great to-go selections. Been coming here for years. Last few visits have been disappointing for sandwiched-and I've been coming here for years. Very strong iced coffee. Hard bread on viet sandwiches and subs :( great croissant sandwhiches.","If you don't know about this place then STOP what you are doing right now and go get one of their sandwiches.  It's cheap and good.  That's it!  Enjoy!","I went there not to long ago & I was greeted by a very nice girl, lupe! It is amazingggg! She prepared my smoothie, which was bomb! (: deffinatley go!","Freshly baked French baguettes and pastries, strong Vietnamese iced coffee, and delicious sandwiches here. You can't really go wrong here, but do bring cash; they don't take credit or debit cards here (though there is an ATM inside). The prices are reasonable and the place is kept clean. It's always a pleasure to come here.","These baguettes are nothing to joke about. They are as good if not better than any baguette I've had in Europe. I can't speak for anything else here but I'll be back to try.","Best banh mi sandwich in Arizona. Wish I lived closer, but it is worth the trip on the weekend for a delicious, fresh, authentic banh mi. French horns are to die for, get there when they open and they will still be a little warm. Cash only!","I'll tell you the bummer first. Lee's is CASH-ONLY. If you don't have cash, they do have a private ATM in the dining room that will rape you with a hefty service charge. But...it's worth it. Get back in line and wait for a tasty American style sandwich, but do it on a croissant....good, or step out of your comfort zone and try a Viet sub on a crusty French baguette loaf..BEST (#11 Special combo rocks!)  Whatever you do, if you DON\"T like jalapenos, tell them! \n\nOther items of note are to be found in the hot-case. Ready-to-eat spicy chicken wings, crunchy thin egg rolls, and a little treat called 'pate chaud'. Picture of a buttery, flaky exterior, almost like filo-dough, with a hot pork or chicken meatball on the inside. They're great for breakfast! \n\nSmoothies? Oh yeah, with or w/o boba balls. Avocado (l know , I know...but you just have to try it). or mango..","Amazing sandwiches, fresh bread on the #5 pork sandwich is amazing (bahn mi) so light and simple but full of good Vietnamese flavor. The other speciality teas and drinks look amazing, will explore more on next visit!","Lees is the place for a great, cheap and fresh sandwich... a couple of suggestions..  They make fresh Baguettes every day and are $1.50 ea. I recommend a smoothie, they are very very good. And dont forget its CASH ONLY.","Cheap eats done machine-gun style. If you're expecting fawning service and polite smalltalk, keep walking, because Lee's is all about getting you in and out. Especially during the lunch crush. \n\nThat's fine with me, because really all I want is to pick up my bag of relatively inexpensive sandwiches and get on with things. \n\nFor more adventurous eaters, there are a wide variety of Asian sandwiches-and the menu is growing all the time. For the timid, all your favorite Sysco near-meat products are available on baguette or croissant. In addition to sandwiches, they have a small variety of Asian-street-foody options, many blended and mixed (soft) drinks, ice cream, and a dozen variations on the ever-popular highly-caffeinated Vietnamese coffee. \n\nOccasionally it smells faintly like cat pee, but that seems to coincide with the appearance of a fresh batch of durian ice cream. Durian: when smelling terrible is the sign of wholesome freshness!","Love the banh mi. I won't say it's the best I've ever had, but it's darn good...especially considering that Lee's Sandwich Shop is a chain. The bread is crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Wish it came with a little more meat. You can request it, but it costs extra. ;) The BBQ pork sandwich is pretty good too. Their service is fast and efficient, and they are pretty friendly. I LOVE their iced coffee. Perfect amount of coffee/condensed milk ratio. Nice strong flavor, even tho there is a lot of ice. FYI, they use chipped ice, so it will definitely come up the staw. It doesnt bother me, but some of my friends hate that. ;)","Pros: They have some of the freshest sandwiches around, and they are even cheaper (and healthier) than the nasty $5 foot long subs at Subway. Lees serves both Asian and American sandwiches as well as pastries, breads, ice scream and delicious drinks. Some of the best foods here are their pastries, so definitely try their croissants, muffins and beignets. Their sandwiches are served either on croissants or french bread (whichever you prefer).  I love their grilled chicken sandwich.\n\nCons: This is a CASH ONLY place so make sure you have that handy or else you have to use the generic ATM (with fees). \n\nAlso, try their iced coffee. It's amazing!  But make sure you ask them to go easy on the ice because they like to fill the entire cup full of ice while only giving you a little bit of coffee. Im always done in about 2 sips, so my trips have been better since I asked for them to hold the ice a bit.","Really dig this place. It's certainly unique! The main disappointment of the visit was I did not order the coffee.. It looked delicious. Next time...","You've gotta come here and get one of their baguettes.  They are the freshest, softest and most flavorful baguettes from anywhere in the whole Valley.  One of their fresh warm baguettes and a couple of tablespoons of soft, sweet cream butter and you have yourself the best breakfast in the world!\n\nThey also create amazing Vietnamese sandwiches using those same delicious baguettes.  It's all amazingly fresh and tasty, but we forewarned before you arrive that they are a cash only operation, so hit up your bank's ATM on the way, or pay the convenience fee to use the freestanding ATM inside of Lee's.","The iced coffee is the best!!! The bread for sandwhiches is tastey, but a little hard to eat.

I ate half of the plain slice because I was starving....then threw both in the garbage.  \n\nIf this is really the best pizza in Pittsburgh... wow.","I ordered from Pizza Parma out of storm necessity. I ordered a chicken parmigiana \"hoagie\", which was dry and luke warm. The potato bacon soup was like something out of a can, except the chunks of potato were hard and undercooked..all pretty nasty and overly salty.\n\nNever order from them.","Zero stars. Came in 10 mins before close. Female manager on duty asked for $100 in exchange for a pizza. When we refused she said she could not serve us because her employees had been working since 9am..,it is currently 2:00 am... Sounds pretty illegal to me","Average pizza. But with ten guys working - and not much business at the moment - it still took twenty minutes to get a slice of pepperoni. I'll walk across the street next time.","My butthole hasn't been right for days, nor my stomach. \n\nWe ordered in because we all had a long day and were set to have a family movie night.\n\nA pizza and hoagie. \n\nThe hoagie wasn't anything to run and go scream from the rooftops about but the pizza was covered in little ass ruining intestinal demons and this I am nearly sure of.\n\nI had to be talked out of sending pizza Parma a bill for several rolls of toilet paper.\n\nBe weary of the pizza, distrustful actually.\n\nYour butthole will thank me for it!","Hubby and I dropped in after a hellish morning at the Social Security office. Hubby loves pizza so we made a stop.\n\nPizza wan't bad, it was actually pretty decent. But the place was disgusting and the cashier was incredibly rude.","I eat this pizza all the time when downtown, usually when running around at events like First Night or the Gallery Crawls...not the best pizza I have ever had in my life, but it's not bad!  And I haven't ever gotten sick from it.  Just wanted to offer a different opinion.","PIzza Parma's decent tasting mega-big-2ft-long hot sausage hoagie was let down by the piss poor attitude of the staff, the lack of cleanliness of the tables and floor, the out-of-order red door restroom, the bright yellow for no-explicable reason walls. \n\nThe large color-striped 80's retro tables and green chairs have come back in style but this win is purely accidental and achieved only by laziness and lack of renovation.\n\nThat is all.","My fiance & I have lived in downtown Pittsburgh for over a year + now & this place is fabulous. \nMy sweetie LOVES LOVES LOVESSS pizza & we order from here a ton.  We haven't ordered anything here that wasn't super tasty.\nThe shop is small & the decor is super bright which makes you want to get in & out quickly but who the hell eats in there anyways. ... you're grabbing your order & running.","I'm glad I listened to my friend's recommendation and not some of these bad reviews. We're just in town for the night and wanted something delivered to our hotel. They said it would take an hour, which I expected on Super Bowl Sunday right at game time, but it was here in less than half an hour. \n\nThe pizza was delicious! Just the right balance of cheese and a tasty sauce, generous with the toppings, and a nicely crispy crust but not too thin.","This place has great service! My best friend and I got 2 custom orders and the older guy in back came out to the register to take our orders personally.  I assume he's either the cook, owner, or both. We ordered 2 cheeselss pizzas; a lot of places mess this up. Pizza Parma however, makes great cheeseless pizza. Our personal pizzas were nice and toasty, not over nor undercooked, and it was not dried out at all! There was more than enough sauce mmmmmmmmm.","My fiance & I have lived in downtown Pittsburgh for over a year + now & this place is fabulous. \nMy sweetie LOVES LOVES LOVESSS pizza & we order from here a ton.

hotel and not really having eaten much all day, I was hungry.\n\nThe service was terrible....no one knew what they were doing so it took 10 minutes to get a freaking slice of pizza and then when said pizza came it was NASTY.\n\nMy husband once got a pizza in Milwaukee where they put Kraft singles on it as cheese and Pizza Parma is just behind that for worst pizza ever.","Looking for a quick bite to eat and a local told me this was \"the best pizza in the city.\"  I got a plain slice and a pepperoni slice. Possibly the worst pizza I have ever eaten.  This wouldn't even qualify as pizza in North Jersey.  I ate half of the plain slice because I was starving....then threw both in the garbage.  \n\nIf this is really the best pizza in Pittsburgh... wow.","I ordered from Pizza Parma out of storm necessity. I ordered a chicken parmigiana \"hoagie\", which was dry and luke warm. The potato bacon soup was like something out of a can, except the chunks of potato were hard and undercooked..all pretty nasty and overly salty.\n\nNever order from them.","Zero stars. Came in 10 mins before close. Female manager on duty asked for $100 in exchange for a pizza. When we refused she said she could not serve us because her employees had been working since 9am..,it is currently 2:00 am... Sounds pretty illegal to me","Average pizza. But with ten guys working - and not much business at the moment - it still took twenty minutes to get a slice of pepperoni. I'll walk across the street next time.","My butthole hasn't been right for days, nor my stomach. \n\nWe ordered in because we all had a long day and were set to have a family movie night.\n\nA pizza and hoagie. \n\nThe hoagie wasn't anything to run and go scream from the rooftops about but the pizza was covered in little ass ruining intestinal demons and this I am nearly sure of.\n\nI had to be talked out of sending pizza Parma a bill for several rolls of toilet paper.\n\nBe weary of the pizza, distrustful actually.\n\nYour butthole will thank me for it!","Hubby and I dropped in after a hellish morning at the Social Security office. Hubby loves pizza so we made a stop.\n\nPizza wan't bad, it was actually pretty decent. But the place was disgusting and the cashier was incredibly rude.","I eat this pizza all the time when downtown, usually when running around at events like First Night or the Gallery Crawls...not the best pizza I have ever had in my life, but it's not bad!  And I haven't ever gotten sick from it.  Just wanted to offer a different opinion.","PIzza Parma's decent tasting mega-big-2ft-long hot sausage hoagie was let down by the piss poor attitude of the staff, the lack of cleanliness of the tables and floor, the out-of-order red door restroom, the bright yellow for no-explicable reason walls. \n\nThe large color-striped 80's retro tables and green chairs have come back in style but this win is purely accidental and achieved only by laziness and lack of renovation.\n\nThat is all.","My fiance & I have lived in downtown Pittsburgh for over a year + now & this place is fabulous. \nMy sweetie LOVES LOVES LOVESSS pizza & we order from here a ton.  We haven't ordered anything here that wasn't super tasty.\nThe shop is small & the decor is super bright which makes you want to get in & out quickly but who the hell eats in there anyways. ... you're grabbing your order & running.","I'm glad I listened to my friend's recommendation and not some of these bad reviews. We're just in town for the night and wanted something delivered to our hotel. They said it would take an hour, which I expected on Super Bowl Sunday right at game time, but it was here in less than half an hour. \n\nThe pizza was delicious! Just the right balance of cheese and a tasty sauce, generous with the toppings, and a nicely crispy crust but not too thin.","This place has great service! My best friend and I got 2 custom orders and the older guy in back came out to the register to take our orders personally.  I assume he's either the cook, owner, or both. We ordered 2 cheeselss pizzas; a lot of places mess this up. Pizza Parma however, makes great cheeseless pizza. Our personal pizzas were nice and toasty, not over nor undercooked, and it was not dried out at all! There was more than enough sauce mmmmmmmmm.","My fiance & I have lived in downtown Pittsburgh for over a year + now & this place is fabulous. \nMy sweetie LOVES LOVES LOVESSS pizza & we order from here a ton.

hotel and not really having eaten much all day, I was hungry.\n\nThe service was terrible....no one knew what they were doing so it took 10 minutes to get a freaking slice of pizza and then when said pizza came it was NASTY.\n\nMy husband once got a pizza in Milwaukee where they put Kraft singles on it as cheese and Pizza Parma is just behind that for worst pizza ever.","Looking for a quick bite to eat and a local told me this was \"the best pizza in the city.\"  I got a plain slice and a pepperoni slice. Possibly the worst pizza I have ever eaten.  This wouldn't even qualify as pizza in North Jersey.  I ate half of the plain slice because I was starving....then threw both in the garbage.  \n\nIf this is really the best pizza in Pittsburgh... wow.","I ordered from Pizza Parma out of storm necessity. I ordered a chicken parmigiana \"hoagie\", which was dry and luke warm. The potato bacon soup was like something out of a can, except the chunks of potato were hard and undercooked..all pretty nasty and overly salty.\n\nNever order from them.","Zero stars. Came in 10 mins before close. Female manager on duty asked for $100 in exchange for a pizza. When we refused she said she could not serve us because her employees had been working since 9am..,it is currently 2:00 am... Sounds pretty illegal to me","Average pizza. But with ten guys working - and not much business at the moment - it still took twenty minutes to get a slice of pepperoni. I'll walk across the street next time.","My butthole hasn't been right for days, nor my stomach. \n\nWe ordered in because we all had a long day and were set to have a family movie night.\n\nA pizza and hoagie. \n\nThe hoagie wasn't anything to run and go scream from the rooftops about but the pizza was covered in little ass ruining intestinal demons and this I am nearly sure of.\n\nI had to be talked out of sending pizza Parma a bill for several rolls of toilet paper.\n\nBe weary of the pizza, distrustful actually.\n\nYour butthole will thank me for it!","Hubby and I dropped in after a hellish morning at the Social Security office. Hubby loves pizza so we made a stop.\n\nPizza wan't bad, it was actually pretty decent. But the place was disgusting and the cashier was incredibly rude.","I eat this pizza all the time when downtown, usually when running around at events like First Night or the Gallery Crawls...not the best pizza I have ever had in my life, but it's not bad!  And I haven't ever gotten sick from it.  Just wanted to offer a different opinion.","PIzza Parma's decent tasting mega-big-2ft-long hot sausage hoagie was let down by the piss poor attitude of the staff, the lack of cleanliness of the tables and floor, the out-of-order red door restroom, the bright yellow for no-explicable reason walls. \n\nThe large color-striped 80's retro tables and green chairs have come back in style but this win is purely accidental and achieved only by laziness and lack of renovation.\n\nThat is all.","My fiance & I have lived in downtown Pittsburgh for over a year + now & this place is fabulous. \nMy sweetie LOVES LOVES LOVESSS pizza & we order from here a ton.  We haven't ordered anything here that wasn't super tasty.\nThe shop is small & the decor is super bright which makes you want to get in & out quickly but who the hell eats in there anyways. ... you're grabbing your order & running.","I'm glad I listened to my friend's recommendation and not some of these bad reviews. We're just in town for the night and wanted something delivered to our hotel. They said it would take an hour, which I expected on Super Bowl Sunday right at game time, but it was here in less than half an hour. \n\nThe pizza was delicious! Just the right balance of cheese and a tasty sauce, generous with the toppings, and a nicely crispy crust but not too thin.","This place has great service! My best friend and I got 2 custom orders and the older guy in back came out to the register to take our orders personally.  I assume he's either the cook, owner, or both. We ordered 2 cheeselss pizzas; a lot of places mess this up. Pizza Parma however, makes great cheeseless pizza. Our personal pizzas were nice and toasty, not over nor undercooked, and it was not dried out at all! There was more than enough sauce mmmmmmmmm.","My fiance & I have lived in downtown Pittsburgh for over a year + now & this place is fabulous. \nMy sweetie LOVES LOVES LOVESSS pizza & we order from here a ton.

waiter was to be found about ten minutes later they gave us our water and left again! It wasn't even busy! There were only TWO dim sum carts floating around somewhere. Then our waiter finally came around and took our orders of lunch entrees. The food was not even that good as the reviews that are posted on here. When we came up to pay, the bill was super overpriced. I will not be returning here, I am better off eating at Great Wall Cuisine.","If this place had zero stars I would have given them that ! Let me start off by saying I was so excited to read all great reviews so maybe I just came in on a off day? We walked in and were seated came over and asked if we wanted water or tea I guess they don't serve anything Else, Then we placed an order pork dumplings and sticky rice nasty! Then I asked if they served egg rolls they said they were out!!! they pushed their little carts around with hot plates that basically steam the food and is not fresh and what you get is soggy poor customer service we had to get up and look for someone to give us our tab so we could get the heck out of there are get some real food. It looked like it would be a great place for groups of people would not recommend if you are on mission for what you want and want to place an order but it could be a fun experience for some people.","You walk into a Chinese restaurant on a Saturday afternoon for dim sum and you expect the place to be PACKED.  Well, walking in to a pretty much empty dining room, it's a VERY CLEAR SIGN.  But my friend insisted and I was very hesitant for good reasons.  Another indicator, the majority of the patrons were NON Asian.  \n\nFood: You walk in and you see carts of the food by the entrance to the dining room.  Umm, I thought dim sum should come right off the steamer and into the carts and they roll it around, not sitting around.  The dim sum was garbage.  It had the typical selection, but at minimum.  \n\nService: It's ok.  But it doesn't make up for the horrible food.\n\nBottom line: NO WAY!  Stay away!","I've been here many times...Mother's Day with family, dim sum with book club, etc. But I will not go back again.  I stopped in to ask the owner about a donation or reduced price for a class of under-privileged kids that I volunteer with.  His reaction was to scoff and shoo me out the door while handing me his card and saying I could email him.  He turned his back and headed off to the messy newspaper-strewn table he haunts between guests arrivals.  Maybe he's a community-minded business owner, but then again, maybe he's not.  I'll be dining elsewhere.","Being from Chicago, we are used to getting authentic Chinese food all the time.  But when we first starting spending a lot of time in Scottsdale/Phoenix, we found it a challenge to get authentic Chinese food.  We were excited to find the Golden Buddha and have made many trips over the years all the way from the Troon North area to get our fix.  However, service has declined to the point where it is no longer worth the aggravation.  We went there last night for Chinese New Year and will never go back.  Granted they were very busy because of a lot of large tables there, but waiting almost an hour to get our food is not acceptable under any circumstance!  45 mins. into our wait, the waitress came back (after we flagged her down to ask about our food) and said one of the dishes we ordered was not available....after 45 mins.!!!! What makes the whole experience an unforgivable one is that the manager/owner is so indifferent and never apologized or offered a discount off the bill...nothing.  When we left, the same manager was at the piano singing in Chinese. Huh?  Other than Nee House in Scottsdale, the search goes on for a restaurant that serves authentic Chinese food closer to home.","I will NEVER go there again.  I reserved a table for a group of 16 people for 5:00 PM on Christmas Eve .  The person on the phone ( I believe the manager) repeatedly asked me to call ahead and give him an accurate head count since he said they'd be swamped that day.  I followed up with him twice.  \nWhen the first couple of us arrived, we had menus shoved in our faces immediately and told we \"Must order now.  Must order now\" because they were going to be busy later on.  The place was practically empty.  As each person arrived, they were treated the same way. \nWe rushed and placed our orders and then they brought out our checks WAY before we saw any sign of our food.  I have never in my life been treated so rudely by a restaurant.\nIt was utter chaos when the food started coming out while everyone struggled to get the correct dish they ordered.  One person didn't get her food until we were all just about finished eating. \nOne top of all that, the food wasn't even good.  I've had better Kung Pao Chicken at Panda Express!\nAfter being rushed through our meal, the place wasn't even half full by the time we left.  I thought being at the Cultural Center, this restaurant would be a sure thing but boy was I wrong.  Lovely way to spend Christmas Eve..","If you are looking a chinese restaurant to host a big party look some other than the Golden Buddah.  I recently attended a banquet at the Golden Buddah and I was shocked at the level of quality of food and service.  Of the 10 dishes served 4 were nearly inedible.  \n\nThere was a crab claw appetizer, most chinese restaurants prepare this dish by taking a crab claw surrounding it with ground shrimp, batter and then deep fry.  At Golden Buddah, the crab claw served was mostly batter.  \n\nThe shark fin soup served was mostly broth.  Shark fin is an expensive ingredient and most places usually use imitation shark fin, but come on at least put something in there so that I know I'm eating soup and not dirty sink water.  \n\nGinger scallion lobster is battered, fried, and then stir fried in a sauce with ginger and scallions.  The ginger scallion lobster served was over-cooked and dried out.  \n\nLastly, there was a steamed fish.  The fish was raw in the middle.   \n\nIt wasn't all bad, there was a crispy chicken with garlic dish that was pretty good, but out of 10 dishes 4 were bad, 5 were okay, and 1 was good.  \n\nDoes 4 bad dishes out of 10 warrant a one star rating?  Well it does when you factor in the service.  The soup, appetizer, and first entree arrived timely, but after that there was a 1 hour gap before we received the next dish.  The dishes were not served with accompanying white rice which I thought was odd.  We had to ask for it, and even the rice took a while to arrive.","I agree with Crystal C., that the dim sum isn't the greatest I've ever had. In fact, I am not sure if the meal was so tasty that it was memorable. I do remember the \"calamari\" was not really calamari, like you would think. It was presented more like a sweet and sour pork (so calamari with LOTS of breading) without any sauce. As a result, the dish was dry and salty.\n\nThe sticky rice was good (hard to mess up), the chicken feet were okay (needed more five spice powder), and the shumai was alright. The noodles were good, and I can see why the cart ran out after the first round. The diners were an equal mix of Asians and Americans. I would've preferred to see more Asians eating (as I am used to in a Chinatown and gives an indication of authenticity), but I do realize we're in Phoenix where the Asian population is not like San Francisco or Houston. \n\nThe meal came to about $30 for two, including jasmine tea. The carts are loud because they are made out of metal and roll on tile. I am also not used to staff members shouting what they have in their cart, like a newspaper boy yelling \"Extra! Extra!\" Christmas music was playing after mid-January, so the atmosphere felt strange. Next time I visit the city, I probably will pass.","Can't say that I was very impressed. Came for dinner in a hopeful and enthusiastic mood since the reviews have been pretty good, but I don't think this place lives up to its current good, but declining rating.\n\nOrdered the Combo fried rice (shrimp, chicken, beef, pork), sesame chicken, and garlic fried chicken. \n\nThe combo fried rice was pretty good, but ended up drinking about 6 glasses of water due to the MSG and sodium content. You'd think that the cook spent his better years in the French Foreign Legion in the Sahara eating salt tablets and developed a taste for them. \n\nThe sesame chicken had a good flavor and a thick brown sweet sauce. I liked it a lot until it got cool and the sauce looked (with that stringy consistency) more like glue. You think I'm kidding? I'm not.\n\nGarlic fried chicken was bad. Just bad. It was like an over roasted dried out half chicken with some dried garlic pieces sprinkled on top. No spices, no flavor, no good. \n\nWe then got all kinds of lip from the waitress when we asked if they could change the channel on the TV from college football, to the Suns game. They made it into this big deal that the \"customers\" wanted to see the football game. Yeah right, it was University of West Virginia Vs. University of Connecticut! I would have believed it if it was a local team....\n\nIt's better than a 1 star joint, but only because it's borderline edible. To be avoided.","This restaurant is located in the Chinese Cultural Center and was the one restaurant that I had not been to. So after some shopping at one of the shops, we stepped in to have dinner.\n\nWe stepped in and asked for a seat for two. We were seated immediately. The place was decorated nicely and a lady playing the piano made for great ambiance.\n\nWe looked at the menu briefly and ordered our drinks, an appetizer, a soup and two main dishes. The drinks came out promptly and so did the rest of the meal. My goodness everything we ordered was very tasty.\n\nThe waiter service itself however was not even close to the decor and food. He never introduced himself, and although he took our order, our food itself was brought out by a kitchen person.\n\nAfter we ordered our waiter really never came back asking if we needed anything else, except to give us our check at the end and that was after the person I was dining with got up and asked a different waiter for it.\n\nIt's amazing how a place with great food, decor, and ambiance can mess it all up by crappy waiter service.","I love Dim Sum, my favorite Chinese dish.\n\nWhen Golden Buddha first open, they have excellent Dim sum. I went there many times, I tell my friend how good it is, But now,  they change cook, taste more like  week old left over. Rumor has it, they change cook every few month, so Quality of cooking change. (not sure if that is true, but that is what I was told.)\nMy advice is; when you walk in the door and the place is pack, = Good Cook. if the place is bare = bad cook. leave immediately. don't waste your money.","If you just \"want\" dim sum, go here. If you are \"craving\" dim sum, go elsewhere (take a 5 hour drive west to neighboring state, California).\n\nAnyway, I've been visiting Golden Buddha in the noontime for roughly 2 years now. I believe they moved from their original site (7th St. & Osborn), formerly \"China Doll.\" Relocation brought along better atmosphere and smiling faces. This does not mean, better dim sum. But since we are in Phoenix, I will settle for what they have to offer. \n\nBe mindful of the dim sum tab. It's itemized high-medium-low. \n\nShaomai can be found as combinations of pork/mushroom, shrimp, or shark fin (which should not be confused as true shark bits, as the shaomai is prepared to look like a shark's fin). These picks are okay...perhaps on a better day shao mai will be served in less-rigid, or fresher wrappers. Potstickers are okay as well, just the usual scallion and pork, and dry wrapper. The baby pork ribs in light black bean sauce and jalapenos is alright, but sometimes lacks in taste. Tripe is also served in its bare minimum...so if you enjoy the texture and flavor of tripe, try this with its clear sauce and thinly sliced carrots and celery.  \nBuche (that's what I call it), or fried sesame balls are also available, although if you wait until dessert, they will also be a bit stiff. There are a few other things that may be \"spotted\" but are not worth mentioning. \n\nDon't order from their lunch menu, as you can find these over-salted dishes at Panda Express anyway. \n\nOverall, dim sum at Golden Buddha is a place to go if you are around the vicinity and feel like having something apart from the usual fast food. However, discriminating palates- beware.","Not impressed with this place at all. This was not the friendliest place around, maybe because of the language barrier (most or all were clearly native Chinese speakers), or maybe just the attitude of the employees.\n\nI ordered the sweet and sour chicken lunch, which came with the typical egg drop soup, crab rangoon, and egg roll. The soup was ok - maybe it's just me, but I prefer a real spoon to the scoop that they gave me. The egg roll was tiny and not that great, and the crab rangoon was ok, but maybe a little undercooked. The chicken wasn't bad, but nothing special, as was the rice and other stuff on the plate.\n\nOverall, this was just not my kind of Chinese place.","Disappointing.  Mediocre at best.  I am staying at the Aloft hotel in phoenix and ordered some delivery. I ordered a couple american chinese food staples: general tso's chicken, dumplings and hot&sour soup.  Soup had zero flavor, dumplings tasted freezer burned and processed.  General tso chicken was ehh. \n\nA lot of good reviews on here so it must be for eat in and for their dim sum.  Don't order delivery, you will be left hungry and unsatisfied.","Went there on Saturday for early lunch.  My wife did the dim sum, it was okay, we were both disgusted by the sugar cane shrimp; but the rest was good.  \n\nI ordered the chicken szechwuan, the waitress warned me it was \"spicy\" the reason I ordered it.  It came out delicious, but not what I would call spicy.  Overall its hard to find good Chinese in the valley and I would call this good without hesitation.","So I was referred to this place from the front desk of my hotel. I'm from SF so I'm coming from a place with really good chinese food. \n\nThe dim sum is just \"ok\" nothing for me to write home about. The one dish that I really liked was the chinese broccoli cooked with garlic sauce. Yum yum yum.  It's in a big bowl, not oily, not saucy, just really good. I think it's $7.50.  \n\nIt's a somewhat pricey and just like all chinese restaurants, it's not the cleanest.  The chair was filthy.  the dishes weren't all that great.  I wouldn't go back unless I want the chinese broccoli.  \n\nSo I went on a Sunday and it was not crowded at all. There's not a huge asian population  in Phoenix (not that I could tell) so I don't think there's a high demand for dim sum.  And also, I sooooooo felt like taking a pic of this, but a Mexican lady was pushing one of the dim sum carts. That is unheard of in SF.  This is a mainly mandarin restaurant and the dim sum places I go are usually cantonese.  Not a big deal though since the dishes look the same. \n\nDude, there was a turtle in the fish tank that I saw as I left.  I hope they don't eat that!","A Premier Chinese Atmosphere,\nThe Chinese cultural center and Asian Garden produces an Asain atmosphere that can be recognized from the 202.  \n With Dim Sum served this location earns its respect from the local community.\n\nDim Sum tip,  You have to be smart with the Dim Sum ladies they look nice innocent but they are professional sales people that will sell you more dishes than you need before you know what to do.  \n\nI love the desserts here ask the server to see the dessert tray.","This restaurant has a bit of an identity crisis. It is in the Chinese cultural center, but serves Japanese beer (Kirin on tap!) and the live piano music is American pop. We had to ask for chopsticks.\n\nHaving said that, the service was professional. Our waiter held a hot appetizer for one of our party who was away from the table so that it would not be cold when he returned. We were asked frequently--and not too frequently--if things were ok both by our waiter and the manager/proprietor.\n\nThe food was ok-to-good. Fried shrimp egg rolls were dainty but yummy. Duck was tasty but very chewy. Kung-pao chicken was pleasantly spiced. Plenty of rice. A pitcher of ice water with lemon was left at the table. \n\nAtmosphere was also pleasant. Chairs comfortable, tables spaced well, restrooms large and clean...and there is indeed a large golden Buddha by the entrance.","I took a group of friends here and relatives other times. The place is consistently good for Dim-sum during lunch. It is typical Chinese and nothing fancy.\n\nWhat helps this place is the moat scenery.  3 stars for visiting here based on convenience since there are similar places in town.","Having grown up in Hong Kong and having eaten dim sum in London, NY, LA, SF and Vancouver (actually Richmond), I can confidently say I know my dim sum.\n\nGood selection of well-executed dim sum when the carts actually come around and there's anything left in it.  I'd give it 4 stars for food but the wait definitely detracted from the whole experience.\n\nI think the problem with Golden Buddha is that they can't handle the heavy flow on weekends.  There's not enough regular dim sum eaters like LA that can sustain a steady flow of diners throughout the week, forcing restaurants like Golden Buddha to depend heavily on extra part-time help on weekends.  \n\nDim sum takes serious skill so the chef still ends up doing most of the work.  When we looked into the kitchen, we saw a Chinese woman doing most of the cooking herself.  No wonder it took forever for a cart to come out and when it does, it's swarmed on by a pack of vultures.\n\nIf you're willing to eat at a more simply decorated place with a smaller menu, I'd highly recommend China Chan.  It's much more relaxed - usually no wait on weekends.  An experienced chef makes all the dim sum himself so the menu's much shorter but all the classics are on it.  Anything steamed is made to order so is very fresh.","Situated in the Chinese Cultural Center near the SkyHarbor Airport, this was another pleasant find. All I had was the Dim Sum menu, and I would say this is the best you're gonna get in Phoenix. Still worth the stop to get your Dim Sum fix. The cart ladies were pleasant and very happy to converse with me in Cantonese. Only downside was the chicken sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaves, naw mei gai, was way overcooked, and mushy.","Do you want to eat Chinese Food in an elegant environment on a Friday night in Phoenix? \n\nBe entertained by classic, quiet standards being played live on a piano while you dine?\n\nAre you 50 years old and Caucasian?\n\nThen the Golden Buddha is the place for you! \n\nIts in the Chinese Cultural Center Mall on 44th, and a popular weekend spot for Dim Sum. For a DIm Sum starved Valley of the Sun, Golden Buddha's is decent. \n\nFor dinner, though, it is awfully Americanized and not very authentic Chinese. But with a bunch of American customers coming for dinner, what do you expect? They probably think they are getting \"real Chinese\" food by going to the Chinese Mall, but then again, they are used to PF Chang's or Stix normally in their neighborhood, so this is a step up.\n\nThe best thing about this place is the decor, which is clean and nice, with a Hong Kong Junk boat design covering the ceiling from the bar into the dining room. The next best thing is the Piano interludes on weekend nights. The service is next, which is a little overly eager to remove your plate, and the last thing is the food. \n\nThey do give decent portions. I ordered Guo Teh (potstickers) and got 6 fat ones. But they weren't served with the usual soy, chili oil and vinegar, but a soy and green onions mixture. The Mapo Tofu was ok, as they used a nice silky tofu, which was nice, but no green onions, and sliced black mushrooms instead, which I like, but not in this dish.\n\nCome here for the ambiance and music in the evenings, or on the weekend days for Dim Sum.","Decent dim sum, especially to be found in the middle of the desert. Sadly, the best food I've had in Phoenix.","This place is a little difficult for me to review.  I was staying at the Hampton Inn across the street and this is the closest restaurant so off I went.\n\nI walked in and the owner or manager met me at the door and asked \"how many\"?\n\nI told him I wanted to order take out and handed me a menu and pointed to the waiting area which was covered in newspapers.  I chose to go to the bar, order a glass of wine, and peruse the menu.\n\nThe drinks are expensive but I didn't think the food was.  Less than $10 for my Mongolian Chicken which came with white sticky rice and a fortune cookie.  When ordering I asked if I could have fried rice instead of white rice but was told \"no\".  Most places allow this for a nominal fee.\n\nFine by me.  Give the white rice.  Food was prepared and their to-go boxes were a lot better than the standard white Chinese \"to go\" boxes.  They also included the plastic-ware, napkin, and soy sauce, which a lot of places forget.\n\nLooking around I found a whole lot of goodness along with a couple disappointments.  Most notably the newspaper strewn about and behind the bar, to the right were a lot of boxes stacked in an unsightly fashion.  I could have been a little more presentable in my opinion.\n\nI peeked into the dining room because I wanted to see if the piano music was piped in or live.  It was live which was very nice. Also, the dinning room looked very nice and cozy.\n\nAs I was leaving the same man who greeted me upon entering made sure to wish me a good evening.  My initial impression of the man was that he was surly and testy but that's just how he comes off.\n\nThe food was very good.  The Mongolian sauce was mixture of sweet with spice and the chicken and vegetables all tasted fresh.","My husband and I went there Saturday, the service was great!  Our friends were going to be late so they told us to start.  And start we did!\nThey were serving Dim Sum, something we had never tried, so glad we did, it was wonderful, hubby wouldn't do the chicken feet, but I think next time I will, it looked very good.\nOur friends showed up and ordered their food, and ate all of it, they said that usually they take food home, but it was so good they had to eat all of it!\nWe will be going back very soon!","Let's see, over 50... check \nold white man...........check \neats dinner ...............check \nlistens to the piano  check \n\nwow this must be the place for me, I mean after all it is in a Chinese mall, no make that a Chinese Cultural Center. How could I possibly have discerning taste with such trickery to get me here to eat. \nDude if you are going to rate a restaurant no need to degrade others with your arrogance. \nFool is my review of wanugee N. \n\nNow on the restaurant. The last time we were here the food was not good, the piano was too loud and the waitress had a real attitude. IT won't keep me from going back as I have had good meals and wait service too. \n\nBack to wanugee N. I do not expect any place in Phx. to have authentic Chinese food, by that I mean the street food one finds in China. \nBut I do expect what I fork in to my mouth is worth what I am going to fork over in cost. Even an old white guy like me can tell the difference between good and bad food. No matter what it is called.","Okay so Ive been glum the past few days as I have an impending birthday. Every year this time I get all down in the dumps.. not that I'm not happy with my life cause life is good. Its more like getting further away from my youth and closer to being well, old. All of my grandparents were crotchety, sourpuss drama queens.. is that my fate? Can I break the mold or am I to going to be a crotchety sourpuss?\n\nSo as I contemplate and figure out what I'm going to do with my birthday baggage I decide to squash it with food. All weekend Ive been eating out and having a good time. This is one of the few times outside of a vacation where I will live it completely and to the near of sheer gluttony. So why not dim sum? \n\nIve chowed much dim sum in my 36 years of earthen wear.. of course some good and some bad. I have never been to a place where every dish was great.. Golden Buddha is no exception to this.. they do the basics well enough and have enough funky cool Asian style to keep me interested in returning. The carts around 1130 flow well but around noon it' s full blown freeway action! In fact there might be some road kill in there based on some of the looks on that last steam cart.. \n\nMe and 3 others who were feeling my pain ordered 14, count them, 14 different dishes. One of my friends is from Georgia and had never had dim sum but he is so courageous and unflinching that he was just a blast. Just the shot in the arm to get me out of my funk. I remember the first time I had dim sum.. my eyes wide open, nostrils flared and excited to see what was under the next steamer lid. That was him today.. one exciting thing after the next.. he was even willing to try chicken feet but this is one of those dishes not done very well here. \n\nMy friend took me back to a time where I was younger and less experienced. He looked up to me to guide him through the noodles, bao and sui mai.. like a big brother.. I'm privileged that I could show him something new and exciting and he was so into it! So instead of feeling sorry for myself I felt experienced and useful.. that there is something I can give back to others.. that its not all about me and me aging but about what can be shared with others.\n\nThere is so much more to do, give and feel in this short time we are here.. and Ill do it to, one bite at a time.","The best to be found in land locked Arizona.  My favorite sticky rice is here.  They have dim sum every day, but not a huge selection, though you can order off the menu.  I think it is much bigger on the weekends.  I'm just happy I can get my fix 7 days a week.  Beautiful gardens to walk through, with fish ponds, and a 99 market next door!","I ate at Golden Buddha a few weeks ago.  We ate at the restaurant after a day at the zoo with our 4 year old and had a blast.  The piano bar played tunes for my daughter and the staff was more than accommodating.  The general tso chicken was better than anything I can get in Tucson.  The soup was chocked full of fresh, read FRESH, not canned, vegetables.  All in all, I was very satisfied with the meal and the service.  Plus the decor is very nice, clean and cheery. \n\nEat at Golden Buddha.","For those who gave this place low marks, forgive me. I really like this place. Now I haven't tried various dim sum places so I'm reserving the right to downgrade the place as needed. The variety of food is plentiful, and the carts just keep on coming. I love the steamed pork buns, and the shiu mai (not sure if I spelled that correctly). Yesterday, my favorite pick was the deep fried rolls of taro and shrimp. YUM! I have never ordered from their menu so I can only talk about their dim sum. My friends and I try to go eat dim sum almost every Sunday. It's a cheap way to try new foods, and if you don't like it, well.. you can get away with pushing it aside with minimal guilt. Give it a try! You might be surprised.","I like Golden Buddha, have taken many friends there for Dim Sum.  \nTry not to \"hit\" the dumpling cart to heavy; otherwise cannot finish it to the dessert cart (LOL).\nLove the jasmine tea and the staff willing to help you if you do not understand the what each item is.\nSingapore Rice Noodles a favorite, along with any of the shrimp dumplings; also the broccoli and green beans.\nOnly wish that the carts with eggplant stuffed with shrimp or green peppers with shrimp were not on \"heated\" carts; by the time it gets to you the food is cold.\nOnly concern is that went on 22MAY2010 at 1:30PM; there was a closed sign due to electricity???\nREVISED: 26MAY2010 - called this evening - looks like they are back open again.","I've been to the Golden Buddha on several occasions and it is my favorite, by far, for honest Chinese food. \nWhile I've sampled everything from their vegetarian to their beef, I love their mandarin chicken. More recently, I was delighted to relive the wonders of their Kung Pao Chicken and Beef with Broccoli. \nI absolutely love the egg drop soup and mini crab rangoons that come with the meal.","The very first time I went to Golden Buddha was with my BFF and it was our first dim sum experience. Little did I know this would forever change my life and eating experiences. Although I must admit that first time was a bit awkward.\n\nGB wisely takes reservations which was wonderful (even though it wasn't crazy busy). Our assorted dim sum plates were flavorful and fresh. And the carts seemed to be in constant rotation so we were never too far from a good selection.\n\nWhat really helps GB is its location. The Cofco Center is an experience in itself, where one can have herbs specially blended, select a fresh member of marine life to take home and cook or browse through a store with one of the largest selections of Buddhas and hand fans I've experienced outside of San Francisco.","I've been to Golden Buddha a few times and have not been disappointed. \n\nThey have a LARGE selection of Dim Sum and if you're not careful you can get carried away.\n\nTry and get there early and you'll get the best and most fresh selection.\nMake sure you walk around the garden when you're done.","Probably the most comprehensive Chinese menu in the Valley.  Pick from well over 100 dishes, but if you want the best order the Peking Duck.  Everything else is very good, but without a wow factor.  You'll see lots of Chinese people in this massive restaurant, which probably means they're doing a fine job in the kitchen.","I very much enjoyed eating here. Food was great. Fairly fast service. Wasn't expensive either for the 4 of us.","Golden Buddha has GREAT dim sum.  Their prices are reasonable and the staff is very polite wheeling their little carts.  I tend to go on the weekend because there is more selection but they do dim sum throughout the week.  They also have some very authentic dishes on the menu for those who are more of the adventurous types.  Be sure to say hello to the turtles the next time you go.","This place in the Chinese Cultural Center has a very pretty and elegant bar area. I was pleased to learn that they had some very reasonable and delicious happy hour snacks. This is a good place for a Pina Colada. I had one by myself along with some dumplings and fried shrimp appetizer. Sadly I never brought anyone else here with me. It was happy hour heaven but you know? A lot of my friends in AZ pretty much hang out in one neighborhood or another and nobody I know really lives close to the Buddha.\nThe airport is pretty close by. This might be a good pre-flight send-off location.","I have had dim sum in New Orleans and Phoenix (not SF), and this is about equal to the best of New Orleans as far as flavor.\nAs for ambiance, today was a good day. I've had dim sum here about a dozen times, and have had very good service and quality 90% of the time, including weekends. I have had bad days here, but since today was good, I'll rate accordingly. It's closer to a 4.5, but since I can't give half-stars, I rounded up.\nDon't expect me to give these the right names, but... I was less than impressed with the bbq pork balls. They tasted too much like honey and the beef was minimal. The bbq sauce tasted bottled. Outside of that, their herbal hot tea is delicious even on a hot day.\nThe shu mai were very good, and the shrimp in a spinach dumpling was fantastic. A definite don't miss is their sticky rice in lotus leaf. It's among the best I've had anywhere. Just be careful; you'll find bones in it every once in a while. Go for any of their steamed dumplings; they're very flavorful. As others have said, I love the Chinese broccoli, but you'll only find it on the carts on weekends. Otherwise order it off the menu.\nToday (11:30 lunch) the carts came around often, and everything except the pork buns was piping hot and fresh. By the way, despite the price increases, even the sticky rice was considered a medium size entree, and the two of us eating there escaped with a bill under $20 and we were done in under 30 minutes.\nI strongly recommend the dim sum here, whether you've had it a million times or have never had it before. You usually won't be disappointed.","I don't really understand the poor reviews on this place.....maybe it depends on the day you go? We went on a Sunday, it was crazy busy, but service was great! (of course, my view of customer service is a little different then the rest... I used to live on an island where you were just happy to find what you were looking for, let alone expect good customer service) Anyways, our server was very sweet! Always had a smile on her face. The carts served us promplty and none of the food was cold. They always had whatever we wanted (I hate having to wait for the next cart).\n\nNow, as for the actual dim sum and food.......holy cow, to die for! So flavorful and fresh!! The broccoli makes you sing...and the wine noodles, make you cry. You leave with very weird mixed emotions, but mostly a happy belly full of yummy food.\n\nIn my opinion, this is the best dim sum I have been able to find in Phx. I'm ditching my previous spot (Mekong Palace) and will be back to Golden Buddha when the dim sum monster strikes again!"],"type":["Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low

hotel and not really having eaten much all day, I was hungry.\n\nThe service was terrible....no one knew what they were doing so it took 10 minutes to get a freaking slice of pizza and then when said pizza came it was NASTY.\n\nMy husband once got a pizza in Milwaukee where they put Kraft singles on it as cheese and Pizza Parma is just behind that for worst pizza ever.","Looking for a quick bite to eat and a local told me this was \"the best pizza in the city.\"  I got a plain slice and a pepperoni slice. Possibly the worst pizza I have ever eaten.  This wouldn't even qualify as pizza in North Jersey.  I ate half of the plain slice because I was starving....then threw both in the garbage.  \n\nIf this is really the best pizza in Pittsburgh... wow.","I ordered from Pizza Parma out of storm necessity. I ordered a chicken parmigiana \"hoagie\", which was dry and luke warm. The potato bacon soup was like something out of a can, except the chunks of potato were hard and undercooked..all pretty nasty and overly salty.\n\nNever order from them.","Zero stars. Came in 10 mins before close. Female manager on duty asked for $100 in exchange for a pizza. When we refused she said she could not serve us because her employees had been working since 9am..,it is currently 2:00 am... Sounds pretty illegal to me","Average pizza. But with ten guys working - and not much business at the moment - it still took twenty minutes to get a slice of pepperoni. I'll walk across the street next time.","My butthole hasn't been right for days, nor my stomach. \n\nWe ordered in because we all had a long day and were set to have a family movie night.\n\nA pizza and hoagie. \n\nThe hoagie wasn't anything to run and go scream from the rooftops about but the pizza was covered in little ass ruining intestinal demons and this I am nearly sure of.\n\nI had to be talked out of sending pizza Parma a bill for several rolls of toilet paper.\n\nBe weary of the pizza, distrustful actually.\n\nYour butthole will thank me for it!","Hubby and I dropped in after a hellish morning at the Social Security office. Hubby loves pizza so we made a stop.\n\nPizza wan't bad, it was actually pretty decent. But the place was disgusting and the cashier was incredibly rude.","I eat this pizza all the time when downtown, usually when running around at events like First Night or the Gallery Crawls...not the best pizza I have ever had in my life, but it's not bad!  And I haven't ever gotten sick from it.  Just wanted to offer a different opinion.","PIzza Parma's decent tasting mega-big-2ft-long hot sausage hoagie was let down by the piss poor attitude of the staff, the lack of cleanliness of the tables and floor, the out-of-order red door restroom, the bright yellow for no-explicable reason walls. \n\nThe large color-striped 80's retro tables and green chairs have come back in style but this win is purely accidental and achieved only by laziness and lack of renovation.\n\nThat is all.","My fiance & I have lived in downtown Pittsburgh for over a year + now & this place is fabulous. \nMy sweetie LOVES LOVES LOVESSS pizza & we order from here a ton.  We haven't ordered anything here that wasn't super tasty.\nThe shop is small & the decor is super bright which makes you want to get in & out quickly but who the hell eats in there anyways. ... you're grabbing your order & running.","I'm glad I listened to my friend's recommendation and not some of these bad reviews. We're just in town for the night and wanted something delivered to our hotel. They said it would take an hour, which I expected on Super Bowl Sunday right at game time, but it was here in less than half an hour. \n\nThe pizza was delicious! Just the right balance of cheese and a tasty sauce, generous with the toppings, and a nicely crispy crust but not too thin.","This place has great service! My best friend and I got 2 custom orders and the older guy in back came out to the register to take our orders personally.  I assume he's either the cook, owner, or both. We ordered 2 cheeselss pizzas; a lot of places mess this up. Pizza Parma however, makes great cheeseless pizza.

This place didn't even deserve a star! I order 1 sandwich and it took 20min to make and this was at 4:26pm they where not busy. When I got the sandwich (number 11) it only had TWO Slices of meat and a tons of carrots. This place has gone to the dumps the only thing health about this place is your jaw gets a workout from chewing the hard French bread! I'd rather go to subway and I hate subway. I'll never go here again.\n\n***Look at every French roll sandwich picture and you can see the amount of meat if you can see the meat at all!***","I would give it zero star if I could because of food safety reason. My husband and I went here for brunch. He ordered a grilled pork banh mi stuffed with some suspiciously bright-colored meat, pickled veggies, and raw cilantro. I got a breakfast sandwich with cooked eggs, ham, and cheese on croissant. Later that day, my husband started to feel sick - lack of appetite, light headed, and slight diarrhea. The diarrhea was getting much worse that night and the symptoms lasted for 2 days after we put him on anti-diarrhea medicines. We believe it was due to food poisoning from the banh mi since we ate otherwise the same food that day. We had banh mi regularly in other places and we never had any issue. This place charged less for a reason. I feel grossly sick when I think about the who-knows-what meat like stuff and RAW veggies. Beware of the food safety issues here!","Mediocre sandwiches.  To much bread and only a small amount of meat.  They don't even taste good at all, nothing special about them.  The Thai tea here is good and I've heard the same about the coffees, but I won't be eating here again.","I ordered a #2 pork roll sandwich.   I nearly chipped/broke my tooth biting into it.  Sandwich was hard as a rock.  \nVery disappointing compared to California's lee sandwiches.","Very good/cheap Vietnamese sandwiches..I wouldn't call it fast food...more like painfully slow...I think there is one guy preparing all the food :-/...it's cash only but I'd advise not to use their ATM..it only gave me $20 but debted me $60...when I asked the guy who I saw refilling the machine he waived me off and told me to go to the cashier..I was ready to call the cops!","Service is always great and fast. Food is cheap! Coming from Hawaii and LA, I have been exposed to some pretty darn good Vietnamese sandwiches that feature fried tofu. So being that I've relocated here, this was the only place so far that has authentic Vietnamese style sandwiches. I've had the vegetarian one quite a few times, and although I am super happy with it in general, it does not have slabs of BBQ tofu as I'm used to... I wish it did!! With out a juicy tofu inside, this vege sandwich tends to be dry and lacking the kick and the fillings that I'm used to getting in Hawaii and LA. I get the feeling like Arizona is not a tofu happy place. I very rarely see it on menus as I do in Hawaii and LA. :( I think this sandwich would be killer if they used real pieces of BBQ'd tofu. I'm still happy to go there and get a sandwich since its the only Vietnamese place that offers a vege Vietnamese sandwich that I could find.","The bread was very good.   The sandwich (pastrami) was just average.\n\nPrices are all reasonable and a pretty large menu.  I'm guessing  (hoping)  some of the asian sandwiches  rise above average.\n\nProbably  a 3.5.","Loved the veggie summer rolls though a bit highly priced. The BBQ pork sandwich is good because I don't like pate and most other places put pate. I was let down to find out later i was charged 30 cent for jalape\u00f1os and they didn't say anything.","As a Southern Californian, I wouldn't go to Lee's Sandwiches because there are just so many better and even cheaper Banh mi joints. However, in AZ, the options are pretty limited. Definitely helped curb my Banh mi cravings but the sandwiches were seriously skimpy. The mint milk was not minty at all but the fresh pressed nuoc mia (sugar cane juice)  was super refreshing.","I had their pork sandwich and it was very flavorful but there was a lot of fat that you have to work around.","\"Fresh\" Hot Baguette, Croissant!!  OMG \nBut when their are not fresh is like regular bread in the market \nRecently try salami sandwich and don't remember pork one excellent","One bite of the jambon and pate sandwich and I'm taken back to the summers I spent in France as a college kid. Excellent baguettes and great French-style sandwiches. I walk out after lunch wondering where my backpack and Eurail pass are...\n\nWish they were open late enough to grab a bite on the way home after a long day at work.","If you like good, fresh, sandwiches, then you have to try one here at Lee's. I think the bread is what really makes the difference, it is super fresh and would taste good all by itself! Its much cheaper than any other sandwich shop and definitely seems fresher and less assembly line. I think the only thing that can be hit or miss here is the service from time to time, but that is soon forgotten with a sniff of the fresh bread.  Yes they do only accept cash but that is as they say, to keep the prices down.  I usually order the ham and turkey club and a water and i get out of there for about 5 bucks.  I also love the fresh baked baguettes...so good!","I can't believe there's now a Lee's Sandwiches within a hop, skip and a jump from me here in Chandler.  I usually get my Viet-Sammy fix at their location in one of the grittiest, seediest parts of SF. \n\nIn fact, I haven't gone in quite some time because I hate that part of the city, so now that they're nearby in Chandler, I'll get my fix while I can, even if their sammies are skinnier than those in sF.  All good though, since for these prices, I can just pig out by eating two.  Talk about changing demographics!!\n\nGood times guaylo!!!","My family and I frequently visit this sandwich shop whenever we're near the area. The shop is clean, tidy, and has plenty of tables for those who are looking for a very casual dining experience. The baguettes and croissants have always been warm and  freshly baked on every single of the visits I have made here. I personally like the Turkey Club and Bacon Sandwich (with your choice of it being on a baguette or croissant) and costs about $6. My only complaint is that there usually isn't very much meat on the sandwich in relation to the bread - oh, well. They also serve ice cream (the vanilla fudge with M&Ms is my favorite), smoothies, and other fun little drinks. The service is usually always very decent as well. \n\nBe sure to bring cash, this place doesn't take credit cards.","This place has a huge area for seating and is generally pretty busy and packed with Asians which is saying that it is a good cheap place to eat.\n\nThe in house baked baguette bread for their sandwich are awesome. My favorite is the bbq pork sandwich with double meat. If you don't get the double meat you are eating almost just bread. Their spring rolls are pretty good and a decent size and their little egg rolls are a good buy. \n\nYou can't beat the prices here for an inexpensive meal.","I mainly come here for the Asian sandwiches #11(combination) and #6(bbq pork) to be exact.  They are delicious and their service is great.  The only thing I am not a fan of is their eggrolls.  They are crispy but they don't have a flavorful impact when you bite into them.","Grilled pork is amazing! I was hesitant in trying the grilled pork but my sister suggested it.  I'm glad I took the chance.  Love the fresh bread.  Smells so yummy!","I enjoy coming here when I'm in the mood for Vietnamese sandwiches. The place is big and always clean. You never have to wait long to get your food. The bread is fresh but I feel that it always cuts the roof of my mouth. So I would recommend getting the grilled pork sandwich. It's my favorite to get because the grilled pork makes the bread soft so it's not as hard to eat. I also enjoy the avocado smoothie and the egg rolls.  The only thing I don't like about this place is that it's cash only. I never carry cash on me so every time I want to eat here I have to go to the ATM","Oh banh mi, how I love the, your pickled veggies and meat, they don't taste like.... Feet? So.... Maybe I'll stick to the actual reviews and not poetry. \n\nI first came here a couple years ago, as a recommendation from a friend. I usually get the chicken banh mi, and a vegetarian one and put it in the freezer (for later on that night TBH). The mayo and bread are so good, I would recommend getting here earlier for really fresh bread. And beware, I've gotten a mouth full of jalape\u00f1o midway through the sandwich, which was mildly amusing to my date.\n\nALSO. Cash only! They do have an ATM inside though, in case of emergency.y","Love the BBQ pork sandwich!","This place has great bread. Their baguettes are nice and crunchy.  Their sandwiches are reasonably priced . Their meat portions are a little small I recommend maybe an upgrade but they add picked vegetables and some jalape\u00f1os to make a very tasty.i sandwich. Their croissant are some of the best in town the only drawback they only accept cash service can sometimes be a little slow","Usually really tastes sandwiches. The CS is lacking, but the bakery is the best. \nAlso, they only accept cash$$$","4 for the incredible fresh baguettes made there. Fab $1 bins for day old bread, and great to-go selections. Been coming here for years. Last few visits have been disappointing for sandwiched-and I've been coming here for years. Very strong iced coffee. Hard bread on viet sandwiches and subs :( great croissant sandwhiches.","If you don't know about this place then STOP what you are doing right now and go get one of their sandwiches.  It's cheap and good.  That's it!  Enjoy!","I went there not to long ago & I was greeted by a very nice girl, lupe! It is amazingggg! She prepared my smoothie, which was bomb! (: deffinatley go!","Freshly baked French baguettes and pastries, strong Vietnamese iced coffee, and delicious sandwiches here. You can't really go wrong here, but do bring cash; they don't take credit or debit cards here (though there is an ATM inside). The prices are reasonable and the place is kept clean. It's always a pleasure to come here.","These baguettes are nothing to joke about. They are as good if not better than any baguette I've had in Europe. I can't speak for anything else here but I'll be back to try.","Best banh mi sandwich in Arizona. Wish I lived closer, but it is worth the trip on the weekend for a delicious, fresh, authentic banh mi. French horns are to die for, get there when they open and they will still be a little warm. Cash only!","I'll tell you the bummer first. Lee's is CASH-ONLY. If you don't have cash, they do have a private ATM in the dining room that will rape you with a hefty service charge. But...it's worth it. Get back in line and wait for a tasty American style sandwich, but do it on a croissant....good, or step out of your comfort zone and try a Viet sub on a crusty French baguette loaf..BEST (#11 Special combo rocks!)  Whatever you do, if you DON\"T like jalapenos, tell them! \n\nOther items of note are to be found in the hot-case. Ready-to-eat spicy chicken wings, crunchy thin egg rolls, and a little treat called 'pate chaud'. Picture of a buttery, flaky exterior, almost like filo-dough, with a hot pork or chicken meatball on the inside. They're great for breakfast! \n\nSmoothies? Oh yeah, with or w/o boba balls. Avocado (l know , I know...but you just have to try it). or mango..","Amazing sandwiches, fresh bread on the #5 pork sandwich is amazing (bahn mi) so light and simple but full of good Vietnamese flavor. The other speciality teas and drinks look amazing, will explore more on next visit!","Lees is the place for a great, cheap and fresh sandwich... a couple of suggestions..  They make fresh Baguettes every day and are $1.50 ea. I recommend a smoothie, they are very very good. And dont forget its CASH ONLY.","Cheap eats done machine-gun style. If you're expecting fawning service and polite smalltalk, keep walking, because Lee's is all about getting you in and out. Especially during the lunch crush. \n\nThat's fine with me, because really all I want is to pick up my bag of relatively inexpensive sandwiches and get on with things. \n\nFor more adventurous eaters, there are a wide variety of Asian sandwiches-and the menu is growing all the time. For the timid, all your favorite Sysco near-meat products are available on baguette or croissant. In addition to sandwiches, they have a small variety of Asian-street-foody options, many blended and mixed (soft) drinks, ice cream, and a dozen variations on the ever-popular highly-caffeinated Vietnamese coffee. \n\nOccasionally it smells faintly like cat pee, but that seems to coincide with the appearance of a fresh batch of durian ice cream. Durian: when smelling terrible is the sign of wholesome freshness!","Love the banh mi. I won't say it's the best I've ever had, but it's darn good...especially considering that Lee's Sandwich Shop is a chain. The bread is crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Wish it came with a little more meat. You can request it, but it costs extra. ;) The BBQ pork sandwich is pretty good too. Their service is fast and efficient, and they are pretty friendly. I LOVE their iced coffee. Perfect amount of coffee/condensed milk ratio. Nice strong flavor, even tho there is a lot of ice. FYI, they use chipped ice, so it will definitely come up the staw. It doesnt bother me, but some of my friends hate that. ;)","Pros: They have some of the freshest sandwiches around, and they are even cheaper (and healthier) than the nasty $5 foot long subs at Subway. Lees serves both Asian and American sandwiches as well as pastries, breads, ice scream and delicious drinks. Some of the best foods here are their pastries, so definitely try their croissants, muffins and beignets. Their sandwiches are served either on croissants or french bread (whichever you prefer).  I love their grilled chicken sandwich.\n\nCons: This is a CASH ONLY place so make sure you have that handy or else you have to use the generic ATM (with fees). \n\nAlso, try their iced coffee. It's amazing!  But make sure you ask them to go easy on the ice because they like to fill the entire cup full of ice while only giving you a little bit of coffee. Im always done in about 2 sips, so my trips have been better since I asked for them to hold the ice a bit.","Really dig this place. It's certainly unique! The main disappointment of the visit was I did not order the coffee.. It looked delicious. Next time...","You've gotta come here and get one of their baguettes.  They are the freshest, softest and most flavorful baguettes from anywhere in the whole Valley.  One of their fresh warm baguettes and a couple of tablespoons of soft, sweet cream butter and you have yourself the best breakfast in the world!\n\nThey also create amazing Vietnamese sandwiches using those same delicious baguettes.  It's all amazingly fresh and tasty, but we forewarned before you arrive that they are a cash only operation, so hit up your bank's ATM on the way, or pay the convenience fee to use the freestanding ATM inside of Lee's.","The iced coffee is the best!!! The bread for sandwhiches is tastey, but a little hard to eat. The fresh veges on the sandwhiches are really good, before if you don't like jalepe jalape\u00f1os, they put fresh ones on there as well."],"type":["Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low

waiter was to be found about ten minutes later they gave us our water and left again! It wasn't even busy! There were only TWO dim sum carts floating around somewhere. Then our waiter finally came around and took our orders of lunch entrees. The food was not even that good as the reviews that are posted on here. When we came up to pay, the bill was super overpriced. I will not be returning here, I am better off eating at Great Wall Cuisine.","If this place had zero stars I would have given them that ! Let me start off by saying I was so excited to read all great reviews so maybe I just came in on a off day? We walked in and were seated came over and asked if we wanted water or tea I guess they don't serve anything Else, Then we placed an order pork dumplings and sticky rice nasty! Then I asked if they served egg rolls they said they were out!!! they pushed their little carts around with hot plates that basically steam the food and is not fresh and what you get is soggy poor customer service we had to get up and look for someone to give us our tab so we could get the heck out of there are get some real food. It looked like it would be a great place for groups of people would not recommend if you are on mission for what you want and want to place an order but it could be a fun experience for some people.","You walk into a Chinese restaurant on a Saturday afternoon for dim sum and you expect the place to be PACKED.  Well, walking in to a pretty much empty dining room, it's a VERY CLEAR SIGN.  But my friend insisted and I was very hesitant for good reasons.  Another indicator, the majority of the patrons were NON Asian.  \n\nFood: You walk in and you see carts of the food by the entrance to the dining room.  Umm, I thought dim sum should come right off the steamer and into the carts and they roll it around, not sitting around.  The dim sum was garbage.  It had the typical selection, but at minimum.  \n\nService: It's ok.  But it doesn't make up for the horrible food.\n\nBottom line: NO WAY!  Stay away!","I've been here many times...Mother's Day with family, dim sum with book club, etc. But I will not go back again.  I stopped in to ask the owner about a donation or reduced price for a class of under-privileged kids that I volunteer with.  His reaction was to scoff and shoo me out the door while handing me his card and saying I could email him.  He turned his back and headed off to the messy newspaper-strewn table he haunts between guests arrivals.  Maybe he's a community-minded business owner, but then again, maybe he's not.  I'll be dining elsewhere.","Being from Chicago, we are used to getting authentic Chinese food all the time.  But when we first starting spending a lot of time in Scottsdale/Phoenix, we found it a challenge to get authentic Chinese food.  We were excited to find the Golden Buddha and have made many trips over the years all the way from the Troon North area to get our fix.  However, service has declined to the point where it is no longer worth the aggravation.  We went there last night for Chinese New Year and will never go back.  Granted they were very busy because of a lot of large tables there, but waiting almost an hour to get our food is not acceptable under any circumstance!  45 mins. into our wait, the waitress came back (after we flagged her down to ask about our food) and said one of the dishes we ordered was not available....after 45 mins.!!!! What makes the whole experience an unforgivable one is that the manager/owner is so indifferent and never apologized or offered a discount off the bill...nothing.  When we left, the same manager was at the piano singing in Chinese. Huh?  Other than Nee House in Scottsdale, the search goes on for a restaurant that serves authentic Chinese food closer to home.","I will NEVER go there again.  I reserved a table for a group of 16 people for 5:00 PM on Christmas Eve .  The person on the phone ( I believe the manager) repeatedly asked me to call ahead and give him an accurate head count since he said they'd be swamped that day.  I followed up with him twice.  \nWhen the first couple of us arrived, we had menus shoved in our faces immediately and told we \"Must order now.  Must order now\" because they were going to be busy later on.  The place was practically empty.  As each person arrived, they were treated the same way. \nWe rushed and placed our orders and then they brought out our checks WAY before we saw any sign of our food.  I have never in my life been treated so rudely by a restaurant.\nIt was utter chaos when the food started coming out while everyone struggled to get the correct dish they ordered.  One person didn't get her food until we were all just about finished eating. \nOne top of all that, the food wasn't even good.  I've had better Kung Pao Chicken at Panda Express!\nAfter being rushed through our meal, the place wasn't even half full by the time we left.  I thought being at the Cultural Center, this restaurant would be a sure thing but boy was I wrong.  Lovely way to spend Christmas Eve..","If you are looking a chinese restaurant to host a big party look some other than the Golden Buddah.  I recently attended a banquet at the Golden Buddah and I was shocked at the level of quality of food and service.  Of the 10 dishes served 4 were nearly inedible.  \n\nThere was a crab claw appetizer, most chinese restaurants prepare this dish by taking a crab claw surrounding it with ground shrimp, batter and then deep fry.  At Golden Buddah, the crab claw served was mostly batter.  \n\nThe shark fin soup served was mostly broth.  Shark fin is an expensive ingredient and most places usually use imitation shark fin, but come on at least put something in there so that I know I'm eating soup and not dirty sink water.  \n\nGinger scallion lobster is battered, fried, and then stir fried in a sauce with ginger and scallions.  The ginger scallion lobster served was over-cooked and dried out.  \n\nLastly, there was a steamed fish.  The fish was raw in the middle.   \n\nIt wasn't all bad, there was a crispy chicken with garlic dish that was pretty good, but out of 10 dishes 4 were bad, 5 were okay, and 1 was good.  \n\nDoes 4 bad dishes out of 10 warrant a one star rating?  Well it does when you factor in the service.  The soup, appetizer, and first entree arrived timely, but after that there was a 1 hour gap before we received the next dish.  The dishes were not served with accompanying white rice which I thought was odd.  We had to ask for it, and even the rice took a while to arrive.","I agree with Crystal C., that the dim sum isn't the greatest I've ever had. In fact, I am not sure if the meal was so tasty that it was memorable. I do remember the \"calamari\" was not really calamari, like you would think. It was presented more like a sweet and sour pork (so calamari with LOTS of breading) without any sauce. As a result, the dish was dry and salty.\n\nThe sticky rice was good (hard to mess up), the chicken feet were okay (needed more five spice powder), and the shumai was alright. The noodles were good, and I can see why the cart ran out after the first round. The diners were an equal mix of Asians and Americans. I would've preferred to see more Asians eating (as I am used to in a Chinatown and gives an indication of authenticity), but I do realize we're in Phoenix where the Asian population is not like San Francisco or Houston. \n\nThe meal came to about $30 for two, including jasmine tea. The carts are loud because they are made out of metal and roll on tile. I am also not used to staff members shouting what they have in their cart, like a newspaper boy yelling \"Extra! Extra!\" Christmas music was playing after mid-January, so the atmosphere felt strange. Next time I visit the city, I probably will pass.","Can't say that I was very impressed. Came for dinner in a hopeful and enthusiastic mood since the reviews have been pretty good, but I don't think this place lives up to its current good, but declining rating.\n\nOrdered the Combo fried rice (shrimp, chicken, beef, pork), sesame chicken, and garlic fried chicken. \n\nThe combo fried rice was pretty good, but ended up drinking about 6 glasses of water due to the MSG and sodium content. You'd think that the cook spent his better years in the French Foreign Legion in the Sahara eating salt tablets and developed a taste for them. \n\nThe sesame chicken had a good flavor and a thick brown sweet sauce. I liked it a lot until it got cool and the sauce looked (with that stringy consistency) more like glue. You think I'm kidding? I'm not.\n\nGarlic fried chicken was bad. Just bad. It was like an over roasted dried out half chicken with some dried garlic pieces sprinkled on top. No spices, no flavor, no good. \n\nWe then got all kinds of lip from the waitress when we asked if they could change the channel on the TV from college football, to the Suns game. They made it into this big deal that the \"customers\" wanted to see the football game. Yeah right, it was University of West Virginia Vs. University of Connecticut! I would have believed it if it was a local team....\n\nIt's better than a 1 star joint, but only because it's borderline edible. To be avoided.","This restaurant is located in the Chinese Cultural Center and was the one restaurant that I had not been to. So after some shopping at one of the shops, we stepped in to have dinner.\n\nWe stepped in and asked for a seat for two. We were seated immediately. The place was decorated nicely and a lady playing the piano made for great ambiance.\n\nWe looked at the menu briefly and ordered our drinks, an appetizer, a soup and two main dishes. The drinks came out promptly and so did the rest of the meal. My goodness everything we ordered was very tasty.\n\nThe waiter service itself however was not even close to the decor and food. He never introduced himself, and although he took our order, our food itself was brought out by a kitchen person.\n\nAfter we ordered our waiter really never came back asking if we needed anything else, except to give us our check at the end and that was after the person I was dining with got up and asked a different waiter for it.\n\nIt's amazing how a place with great food, decor, and ambiance can mess it all up by crappy waiter service.","I love Dim Sum, my favorite Chinese dish.\n\nWhen Golden Buddha first open, they have excellent Dim sum. I went there many times, I tell my friend how good it is, But now,  they change cook, taste more like  week old left over. Rumor has it, they change cook every few month, so Quality of cooking change. (not sure if that is true, but that is what I was told.)\nMy advice is; when you walk in the door and the place is pack, = Good Cook. if the place is bare = bad cook. leave immediately. don't waste your money.","If you just \"want\" dim sum, go here. If you are \"craving\" dim sum, go elsewhere (take a 5 hour drive west to neighboring state, California).\n\nAnyway, I've been visiting Golden Buddha in the noontime for roughly 2 years now. I believe they moved from their original site (7th St. & Osborn), formerly \"China Doll.\" Relocation brought along better atmosphere and smiling faces. This does not mean, better dim sum. But since we are in Phoenix, I will settle for what they have to offer. \n\nBe mindful of the dim sum tab. It's itemized high-medium-low. \n\nShaomai can be found as combinations of pork/mushroom, shrimp, or shark fin (which should not be confused as true shark bits, as the shaomai is prepared to look like a shark's fin). These picks are okay...perhaps on a better day shao mai will be served in less-rigid, or fresher wrappers. Potstickers are okay as well, just the usual scallion and pork, and dry wrapper. The baby pork ribs in light black bean sauce and jalapenos is alright, but sometimes lacks in taste. Tripe is also served in its bare minimum...so if you enjoy the texture and flavor of tripe, try this with its clear sauce and thinly sliced carrots and celery.  \nBuche (that's what I call it), or fried sesame balls are also available, although if you wait until dessert, they will also be a bit stiff. There are a few other things that may be \"spotted\" but are not worth mentioning. \n\nDon't order from their lunch menu, as you can find these over-salted dishes at Panda Express anyway. \n\nOverall, dim sum at Golden Buddha is a place to go if you are around the vicinity and feel like having something apart from the usual fast food. However, discriminating palates- beware.","Not impressed with this place at all. This was not the friendliest place around, maybe because of the language barrier (most or all were clearly native Chinese speakers), or maybe just the attitude of the employees.\n\nI ordered the sweet and sour chicken lunch, which came with the typical egg drop soup, crab rangoon, and egg roll. The soup was ok - maybe it's just me, but I prefer a real spoon to the scoop that they gave me. The egg roll was tiny and not that great, and the crab rangoon was ok, but maybe a little undercooked. The chicken wasn't bad, but nothing special, as was the rice and other stuff on the plate.\n\nOverall, this was just not my kind of Chinese place.","Disappointing.  Mediocre at best.  I am staying at the Aloft hotel in phoenix and ordered some delivery. I ordered a couple american chinese food staples: general tso's chicken, dumplings and hot&sour soup.  Soup had zero flavor, dumplings tasted freezer burned and processed.  General tso chicken was ehh. \n\nA lot of good reviews on here so it must be for eat in and for their dim sum.  Don't order delivery, you will be left hungry and unsatisfied.","Went there on Saturday for early lunch.  My wife did the dim sum, it was okay, we were both disgusted by the sugar cane shrimp; but the rest was good.  \n\nI ordered the chicken szechwuan, the waitress warned me it was \"spicy\" the reason I ordered it.  It came out delicious, but not what I would call spicy.  Overall its hard to find good Chinese in the valley and I would call this good without hesitation.","So I was referred to this place from the front desk of my hotel. I'm from SF so I'm coming from a place with really good chinese food. \n\nThe dim sum is just \"ok\" nothing for me to write home about. The one dish that I really liked was the chinese broccoli cooked with garlic sauce. Yum yum yum.  It's in a big bowl, not oily, not saucy, just really good. I think it's $7.50.  \n\nIt's a somewhat pricey and just like all chinese restaurants, it's not the cleanest.  The chair was filthy.  the dishes weren't all that great.  I wouldn't go back unless I want the chinese broccoli.  \n\nSo I went on a Sunday and it was not crowded at all. There's not a huge asian population  in Phoenix (not that I could tell) so I don't think there's a high demand for dim sum.  And also, I sooooooo felt like taking a pic of this, but a Mexican lady was pushing one of the dim sum carts. That is unheard of in SF.  This is a mainly mandarin restaurant and the dim sum places I go are usually cantonese.  Not a big deal though since the dishes look the same. \n\nDude, there was a turtle in the fish tank that I saw as I left.  I hope they don't eat that!","A Premier Chinese Atmosphere,\nThe Chinese cultural center and Asian Garden produces an Asain atmosphere that can be recognized from the 202.  \n With Dim Sum served this location earns its respect from the local community.\n\nDim Sum tip,  You have to be smart with the Dim Sum ladies they look nice innocent but they are professional sales people that will sell you more dishes than you need before you know what to do.  \n\nI love the desserts here ask the server to see the dessert tray.","This restaurant has a bit of an identity crisis. It is in the Chinese cultural center, but serves Japanese beer (Kirin on tap!) and the live piano music is American pop. We had to ask for chopsticks.\n\nHaving said that, the service was professional. Our waiter held a hot appetizer for one of our party who was away from the table so that it would not be cold when he returned. We were asked frequently--and not too frequently--if things were ok both by our waiter and the manager/proprietor.\n\nThe food was ok-to-good. Fried shrimp egg rolls were dainty but yummy. Duck was tasty but very chewy. Kung-pao chicken was pleasantly spiced. Plenty of rice. A pitcher of ice water with lemon was left at the table. \n\nAtmosphere was also pleasant. Chairs comfortable, tables spaced well, restrooms large and clean...and there is indeed a large golden Buddha by the entrance.","I took a group of friends here and relatives other times. The place is consistently good for Dim-sum during lunch. It is typical Chinese and nothing fancy.\n\nWhat helps this place is the moat scenery.  3 stars for visiting here based on convenience since there are similar places in town.","Having grown up in Hong Kong and having eaten dim sum in London, NY, LA, SF and Vancouver (actually Richmond), I can confidently say I know my dim sum.\n\nGood selection of well-executed dim sum when the carts actually come around and there's anything left in it.  I'd give it 4 stars for food but the wait definitely detracted from the whole experience.\n\nI think the problem with Golden Buddha is that they can't handle the heavy flow on weekends.  There's not enough regular dim sum eaters like LA that can sustain a steady flow of diners throughout the week, forcing restaurants like Golden Buddha to depend heavily on extra part-time help on weekends.  \n\nDim sum takes serious skill so the chef still ends up doing most of the work.  When we looked into the kitchen, we saw a Chinese woman doing most of the cooking herself.  No wonder it took forever for a cart to come out and when it does, it's swarmed on by a pack of vultures.\n\nIf you're willing to eat at a more simply decorated place with a smaller menu, I'd highly recommend China Chan.  It's much more relaxed - usually no wait on weekends.  An experienced chef makes all the dim sum himself so the menu's much shorter but all the classics are on it.  Anything steamed is made to order so is very fresh.","Situated in the Chinese Cultural Center near the SkyHarbor Airport, this was another pleasant find. All I had was the Dim Sum menu, and I would say this is the best you're gonna get in Phoenix. Still worth the stop to get your Dim Sum fix. The cart ladies were pleasant and very happy to converse with me in Cantonese. Only downside was the chicken sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaves, naw mei gai, was way overcooked, and mushy.","Do you want to eat Chinese Food in an elegant environment on a Friday night in Phoenix? \n\nBe entertained by classic, quiet standards being played live on a piano while you dine?\n\nAre you 50 years old and Caucasian?\n\nThen the Golden Buddha is the place for you! \n\nIts in the Chinese Cultural Center Mall on 44th, and a popular weekend spot for Dim Sum. For a DIm Sum starved Valley of the Sun, Golden Buddha's is decent. \n\nFor dinner, though, it is awfully Americanized and not very authentic Chinese. But with a bunch of American customers coming for dinner, what do you expect? They probably think they are getting \"real Chinese\" food by going to the Chinese Mall, but then again, they are used to PF Chang's or Stix normally in their neighborhood, so this is a step up.\n\nThe best thing about this place is the decor, which is clean and nice, with a Hong Kong Junk boat design covering the ceiling from the bar into the dining room. The next best thing is the Piano interludes on weekend nights. The service is next, which is a little overly eager to remove your plate, and the last thing is the food. \n\nThey do give decent portions. I ordered Guo Teh (potstickers) and got 6 fat ones. But they weren't served with the usual soy, chili oil and vinegar, but a soy and green onions mixture. The Mapo Tofu was ok, as they used a nice silky tofu, which was nice, but no green onions, and sliced black mushrooms instead, which I like, but not in this dish.\n\nCome here for the ambiance and music in the evenings, or on the weekend days for Dim Sum.","Decent dim sum, especially to be found in the middle of the desert. Sadly, the best food I've had in Phoenix.","This place is a little difficult for me to review.  I was staying at the Hampton Inn across the street and this is the closest restaurant so off I went.\n\nI walked in and the owner or manager met me at the door and asked \"how many\"?\n\nI told him I wanted to order take out and handed me a menu and pointed to the waiting area which was covered in newspapers.  I chose to go to the bar, order a glass of wine, and peruse the menu.\n\nThe drinks are expensive but I didn't think the food was.  Less than $10 for my Mongolian Chicken which came with white sticky rice and a fortune cookie.  When ordering I asked if I could have fried rice instead of white rice but was told \"no\".  Most places allow this for a nominal fee.\n\nFine by me.  Give the white rice.  Food was prepared and their to-go boxes were a lot better than the standard white Chinese \"to go\" boxes.  They also included the plastic-ware, napkin, and soy sauce, which a lot of places forget.\n\nLooking around I found a whole lot of goodness along with a couple disappointments.  Most notably the newspaper strewn about and behind the bar, to the right were a lot of boxes stacked in an unsightly fashion.  I could have been a little more presentable in my opinion.\n\nI peeked into the dining room because I wanted to see if the piano music was piped in or live.  It was live which was very nice. Also, the dinning room looked very nice and cozy.\n\nAs I was leaving the same man who greeted me upon entering made sure to wish me a good evening.  My initial impression of the man was that he was surly and testy but that's just how he comes off.\n\nThe food was very good.  The Mongolian sauce was mixture of sweet with spice and the chicken and vegetables all tasted fresh.","My husband and I went there Saturday, the service was great!  Our friends were going to be late so they told us to start.  And start we did!\nThey were serving Dim Sum, something we had never tried, so glad we did, it was wonderful, hubby wouldn't do the chicken feet, but I think next time I will, it looked very good.\nOur friends showed up and ordered their food, and ate all of it, they said that usually they take food home, but it was so good they had to eat all of it!\nWe will be going back very soon!","Let's see, over 50... check \nold white man...........check \neats dinner ...............check \nlistens to the piano  check \n\nwow this must be the place for me, I mean after all it is in a Chinese mall, no make that a Chinese Cultural Center. How could I possibly have discerning taste with such trickery to get me here to eat. \nDude if you are going to rate a restaurant no need to degrade others with your arrogance. \nFool is my review of wanugee N. \n\nNow on the restaurant. The last time we were here the food was not good, the piano was too loud and the waitress had a real attitude. IT won't keep me from going back as I have had good meals and wait service too. \n\nBack to wanugee N. I do not expect any place in Phx. to have authentic Chinese food, by that I mean the street food one finds in China. \nBut I do expect what I fork in to my mouth is worth what I am going to fork over in cost. Even an old white guy like me can tell the difference between good and bad food. No matter what it is called.","Okay so Ive been glum the past few days as I have an impending birthday. Every year this time I get all down in the dumps.. not that I'm not happy with my life cause life is good. Its more like getting further away from my youth and closer to being well, old. All of my grandparents were crotchety, sourpuss drama queens.. is that my fate? Can I break the mold or am I to going to be a crotchety sourpuss?\n\nSo as I contemplate and figure out what I'm going to do with my birthday baggage I decide to squash it with food. All weekend Ive been eating out and having a good time. This is one of the few times outside of a vacation where I will live it completely and to the near of sheer gluttony. So why not dim sum? \n\nIve chowed much dim sum in my 36 years of earthen wear.. of course some good and some bad. I have never been to a place where every dish was great.. Golden Buddha is no exception to this.. they do the basics well enough and have enough funky cool Asian style to keep me interested in returning. The carts around 1130 flow well but around noon it' s full blown freeway action! In fact there might be some road kill in there based on some of the looks on that last steam cart.. \n\nMe and 3 others who were feeling my pain ordered 14, count them, 14 different dishes. One of my friends is from Georgia and had never had dim sum but he is so courageous and unflinching that he was just a blast. Just the shot in the arm to get me out of my funk. I remember the first time I had dim sum.. my eyes wide open, nostrils flared and excited to see what was under the next steamer lid. That was him today.. one exciting thing after the next.. he was even willing to try chicken feet but this is one of those dishes not done very well here. \n\nMy friend took me back to a time where I was younger and less experienced. He looked up to me to guide him through the noodles, bao and sui mai.. like a big brother.. I'm privileged that I could show him something new and exciting and he was so into it! So instead of feeling sorry for myself I felt experienced and useful.. that there is something I can give back to others.. that its not all about me and me aging but about what can be shared with others.\n\nThere is so much more to do, give and feel in this short time we are here.. and Ill do it to, one bite at a time.","The best to be found in land locked Arizona.  My favorite sticky rice is here.  They have dim sum every day, but not a huge selection, though you can order off the menu.  I think it is much bigger on the weekends.  I'm just happy I can get my fix 7 days a week.  Beautiful gardens to walk through, with fish ponds, and a 99 market next door!","I ate at Golden Buddha a few weeks ago.  We ate at the restaurant after a day at the zoo with our 4 year old and had a blast.  The piano bar played tunes for my daughter and the staff was more than accommodating.  The general tso chicken was better than anything I can get in Tucson.  The soup was chocked full of fresh, read FRESH, not canned, vegetables.  All in all, I was very satisfied with the meal and the service.  Plus the decor is very nice, clean and cheery. \n\nEat at Golden Buddha.","For those who gave this place low marks, forgive me. I really like this place. Now I haven't tried various dim sum places so I'm reserving the right to downgrade the place as needed. The variety of food is plentiful, and the carts just keep on coming. I love the steamed pork buns, and the shiu mai (not sure if I spelled that correctly). Yesterday, my favorite pick was the deep fried rolls of taro and shrimp. YUM! I have never ordered from their menu so I can only talk about their dim sum. My friends and I try to go eat dim sum almost every Sunday. It's a cheap way to try new foods, and if you don't like it, well.. you can get away with pushing it aside with minimal guilt. Give it a try! You might be surprised.","I like Golden Buddha, have taken many friends there for Dim Sum.  \nTry not to \"hit\" the dumpling cart to heavy; otherwise cannot finish it to the dessert cart (LOL).\nLove the jasmine tea and the staff willing to help you if you do not understand the what each item is.\nSingapore Rice Noodles a favorite, along with any of the shrimp dumplings; also the broccoli and green beans.\nOnly wish that the carts with eggplant stuffed with shrimp or green peppers with shrimp were not on \"heated\" carts; by the time it gets to you the food is cold.\nOnly concern is that went on 22MAY2010 at 1:30PM; there was a closed sign due to electricity???\nREVISED: 26MAY2010 - called this evening - looks like they are back open again.","I've been to the Golden Buddha on several occasions and it is my favorite, by far, for honest Chinese food. \nWhile I've sampled everything from their vegetarian to their beef, I love their mandarin chicken. More recently, I was delighted to relive the wonders of their Kung Pao Chicken and Beef with Broccoli. \nI absolutely love the egg drop soup and mini crab rangoons that come with the meal.","The very first time I went to Golden Buddha was with my BFF and it was our first dim sum experience. Little did I know this would forever change my life and eating experiences. Although I must admit that first time was a bit awkward.\n\nGB wisely takes reservations which was wonderful (even though it wasn't crazy busy). Our assorted dim sum plates were flavorful and fresh. And the carts seemed to be in constant rotation so we were never too far from a good selection.\n\nWhat really helps GB is its location. The Cofco Center is an experience in itself, where one can have herbs specially blended, select a fresh member of marine life to take home and cook or browse through a store with one of the largest selections of Buddhas and hand fans I've experienced outside of San Francisco.","I've been to Golden Buddha a few times and have not been disappointed. \n\nThey have a LARGE selection of Dim Sum and if you're not careful you can get carried away.\n\nTry and get there early and you'll get the best and most fresh selection.\nMake sure you walk around the garden when you're done.","Probably the most comprehensive Chinese menu in the Valley.  Pick from well over 100 dishes, but if you want the best order the Peking Duck.  Everything else is very good, but without a wow factor.  You'll see lots of Chinese people in this massive restaurant, which probably means they're doing a fine job in the kitchen.","I very much enjoyed eating here. Food was great. Fairly fast service. Wasn't expensive either for the 4 of us.","Golden Buddha has GREAT dim sum.  Their prices are reasonable and the staff is very polite wheeling their little carts.  I tend to go on the weekend because there is more selection but they do dim sum throughout the week.  They also have some very authentic dishes on the menu for those who are more of the adventurous types.  Be sure to say hello to the turtles the next time you go.","This place in the Chinese Cultural Center has a very pretty and elegant bar area. I was pleased to learn that they had some very reasonable and delicious happy hour snacks. This is a good place for a Pina Colada. I had one by myself along with some dumplings and fried shrimp appetizer. Sadly I never brought anyone else here with me. It was happy hour heaven but you know? A lot of my friends in AZ pretty much hang out in one neighborhood or another and nobody I know really lives close to the Buddha.\nThe airport is pretty close by. This might be a good pre-flight send-off location.","I have had dim sum in New Orleans and Phoenix (not SF), and this is about equal to the best of New Orleans as far as flavor.\nAs for ambiance, today was a good day. I've had dim sum here about a dozen times, and have had very good service and quality 90% of the time, including weekends. I have had bad days here, but since today was good, I'll rate accordingly. It's closer to a 4.5, but since I can't give half-stars, I rounded up.\nDon't expect me to give these the right names, but... I was less than impressed with the bbq pork balls. They tasted too much like honey and the beef was minimal. The bbq sauce tasted bottled. Outside of that, their herbal hot tea is delicious even on a hot day.\nThe shu mai were very good, and the shrimp in a spinach dumpling was fantastic. A definite don't miss is their sticky rice in lotus leaf. It's among the best I've had anywhere. Just be careful; you'll find bones in it every once in a while. Go for any of their steamed dumplings; they're very flavorful. As others have said, I love the Chinese broccoli, but you'll only find it on the carts on weekends. Otherwise order it off the menu.\nToday (11:30 lunch) the carts came around often, and everything except the pork buns was piping hot and fresh. By the way, despite the price increases, even the sticky rice was considered a medium size entree, and the two of us eating there escaped with a bill under $20 and we were done in under 30 minutes.\nI strongly recommend the dim sum here, whether you've had it a million times or have never had it before. You usually won't be disappointed.","I don't really understand the poor reviews on this place.....maybe it depends on the day you go? We went on a Sunday, it was crazy busy, but service was great! (of course, my view of customer service is a little different then the rest... I used to live on an island where you were just happy to find what you were looking for, let alone expect good customer service) Anyways, our server was very sweet! Always had a smile on her face. The carts served us promplty and none of the food was cold. They always had whatever we wanted (I hate having to wait for the next cart).\n\nNow, as for the actual dim sum and food.......holy cow, to die for! So flavorful and fresh!! The broccoli makes you sing...and the wine noodles, make you cry. You leave with very weird mixed emotions, but mostly a happy belly full of yummy food.\n\nIn my opinion, this is the best dim sum I have been able to find in Phx. I'm ditching my previous spot (Mekong Palace) and will be back to Golden Buddha when the dim sum monster strikes again!"],"type":["Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low

hotel and not really having eaten much all day, I was hungry.\n\nThe service was terrible....no one knew what they were doing so it took 10 minutes to get a freaking slice of pizza and then when said pizza came it was NASTY.\n\nMy husband once got a pizza in Milwaukee where they put Kraft singles on it as cheese and Pizza Parma is just behind that for worst pizza ever.","Looking for a quick bite to eat and a local told me this was \"the best pizza in the city.\"  I got a plain slice and a pepperoni slice. Possibly the worst pizza I have ever eaten.  This wouldn't even qualify as pizza in North Jersey.  I ate half of the plain slice because I was starving....then threw both in the garbage.  \n\nIf this is really the best pizza in Pittsburgh... wow.","I ordered from Pizza Parma out of storm necessity. I ordered a chicken parmigiana \"hoagie\", which was dry and luke warm. The potato bacon soup was like something out of a can, except the chunks of potato were hard and undercooked..all pretty nasty and overly salty.\n\nNever order from them.","Zero stars. Came in 10 mins before close. Female manager on duty asked for $100 in exchange for a pizza. When we refused she said she could not serve us because her employees had been working since 9am..,it is currently 2:00 am... Sounds pretty illegal to me","Average pizza. But with ten guys working - and not much business at the moment - it still took twenty minutes to get a slice of pepperoni. I'll walk across the street next time.","My butthole hasn't been right for days, nor my stomach. \n\nWe ordered in because we all had a long day and were set to have a family movie night.\n\nA pizza and hoagie. \n\nThe hoagie wasn't anything to run and go scream from the rooftops about but the pizza was covered in little ass ruining intestinal demons and this I am nearly sure of.\n\nI had to be talked out of sending pizza Parma a bill for several rolls of toilet paper.\n\nBe weary of the pizza, distrustful actually.\n\nYour butthole will thank me for it!","Hubby and I dropped in after a hellish morning at the Social Security office. Hubby loves pizza so we made a stop.\n\nPizza wan't bad, it was actually pretty decent. But the place was disgusting and the cashier was incredibly rude.","I eat this pizza all the time when downtown, usually when running around at events like First Night or the Gallery Crawls...not the best pizza I have ever had in my life, but it's not bad!  And I haven't ever gotten sick from it.  Just wanted to offer a different opinion.","PIzza Parma's decent tasting mega-big-2ft-long hot sausage hoagie was let down by the piss poor attitude of the staff, the lack of cleanliness of the tables and floor, the out-of-order red door restroom, the bright yellow for no-explicable reason walls. \n\nThe large color-striped 80's retro tables and green chairs have come back in style but this win is purely accidental and achieved only by laziness and lack of renovation.\n\nThat is all.","My fiance & I have lived in downtown Pittsburgh for over a year + now & this place is fabulous. \nMy sweetie LOVES LOVES LOVESSS pizza & we order from here a ton.  We haven't ordered anything here that wasn't super tasty.\nThe shop is small & the decor is super bright which makes you want to get in & out quickly but who the hell eats in there anyways. ... you're grabbing your order & running.","I'm glad I listened to my friend's recommendation and not some of these bad reviews. We're just in town for the night and wanted something delivered to our hotel. They said it would take an hour, which I expected on Super Bowl Sunday right at game time, but it was here in less than half an hour. \n\nThe pizza was delicious! Just the right balance of cheese and a tasty sauce, generous with the toppings, and a nicely crispy crust but not too thin.","This place has great service! My best friend and I got 2 custom orders and the older guy in back came out to the register to take our orders personally.  I assume he's either the cook, owner, or both. We ordered 2 cheeselss pizzas; a lot of places mess this up. Pizza Parma however, makes great cheeseless pizza. Our personal pizzas were nice and toasty, not over nor undercooked, and it was not dried out at all! There was more than enough sauce mmmmmmmmm.","My fiance & I have lived in downtown Pittsburgh for over a year + now & this place is fabulous. \nMy sweetie LOVES LOVES LOVESSS pizza & we order from here a ton.

waiter was to be found about ten minutes later they gave us our water and left again! It wasn't even busy! There were only TWO dim sum carts floating around somewhere. Then our waiter finally came around and took our orders of lunch entrees. The food was not even that good as the reviews that are posted on here. When we came up to pay, the bill was super overpriced. I will not be returning here, I am better off eating at Great Wall Cuisine.","If this place had zero stars I would have given them that ! Let me start off by saying I was so excited to read all great reviews so maybe I just came in on a off day? We walked in and were seated came over and asked if we wanted water or tea I guess they don't serve anything Else, Then we placed an order pork dumplings and sticky rice nasty! Then I asked if they served egg rolls they said they were out!!! they pushed their little carts around with hot plates that basically steam the food and is not fresh and what you get is soggy poor customer service we had to get up and look for someone to give us our tab so we could get the heck out of there are get some real food. It looked like it would be a great place for groups of people would not recommend if you are on mission for what you want and want to place an order but it could be a fun experience for some people.","You walk into a Chinese restaurant on a Saturday afternoon for dim sum and you expect the place to be PACKED.  Well, walking in to a pretty much empty dining room, it's a VERY CLEAR SIGN.  But my friend insisted and I was very hesitant for good reasons.  Another indicator, the majority of the patrons were NON Asian.  \n\nFood: You walk in and you see carts of the food by the entrance to the dining room.  Umm, I thought dim sum should come right off the steamer and into the carts and they roll it around, not sitting around.  The dim sum was garbage.  It had the typical selection, but at minimum.  \n\nService: It's ok.  But it doesn't make up for the horrible food.\n\nBottom line: NO WAY!  Stay away!","I've been here many times...Mother's Day with family, dim sum with book club, etc. But I will not go back again.  I stopped in to ask the owner about a donation or reduced price for a class of under-privileged kids that I volunteer with.  His reaction was to scoff and shoo me out the door while handing me his card and saying I could email him.  He turned his back and headed off to the messy newspaper-strewn table he haunts between guests arrivals.  Maybe he's a community-minded business owner, but then again, maybe he's not.  I'll be dining elsewhere.","Being from Chicago, we are used to getting authentic Chinese food all the time.  But when we first starting spending a lot of time in Scottsdale/Phoenix, we found it a challenge to get authentic Chinese food.  We were excited to find the Golden Buddha and have made many trips over the years all the way from the Troon North area to get our fix.  However, service has declined to the point where it is no longer worth the aggravation.  We went there last night for Chinese New Year and will never go back.  Granted they were very busy because of a lot of large tables there, but waiting almost an hour to get our food is not acceptable under any circumstance!  45 mins. into our wait, the waitress came back (after we flagged her down to ask about our food) and said one of the dishes we ordered was not available....after 45 mins.!!!! What makes the whole experience an unforgivable one is that the manager/owner is so indifferent and never apologized or offered a discount off the bill...nothing.  When we left, the same manager was at the piano singing in Chinese. Huh?  Other than Nee House in Scottsdale, the search goes on for a restaurant that serves authentic Chinese food closer to home.","I will NEVER go there again.  I reserved a table for a group of 16 people for 5:00 PM on Christmas Eve .  The person on the phone ( I believe the manager) repeatedly asked me to call ahead and give him an accurate head count since he said they'd be swamped that day.  I followed up with him twice.  \nWhen the first couple of us arrived, we had menus shoved in our faces immediately and told we \"Must order now.  Must order now\" because they were going to be busy later on.  The place was practically empty.  As each person arrived, they were treated the same way. \nWe rushed and placed our orders and then they brought out our checks WAY before we saw any sign of our food.  I have never in my life been treated so rudely by a restaurant.\nIt was utter chaos when the food started coming out while everyone struggled to get the correct dish they ordered.  One person didn't get her food until we were all just about finished eating. \nOne top of all that, the food wasn't even good.  I've had better Kung Pao Chicken at Panda Express!\nAfter being rushed through our meal, the place wasn't even half full by the time we left.  I thought being at the Cultural Center, this restaurant would be a sure thing but boy was I wrong.  Lovely way to spend Christmas Eve..","If you are looking a chinese restaurant to host a big party look some other than the Golden Buddah.  I recently attended a banquet at the Golden Buddah and I was shocked at the level of quality of food and service.  Of the 10 dishes served 4 were nearly inedible.  \n\nThere was a crab claw appetizer, most chinese restaurants prepare this dish by taking a crab claw surrounding it with ground shrimp, batter and then deep fry.  At Golden Buddah, the crab claw served was mostly batter.  \n\nThe shark fin soup served was mostly broth.  Shark fin is an expensive ingredient and most places usually use imitation shark fin, but come on at least put something in there so that I know I'm eating soup and not dirty sink water.  \n\nGinger scallion lobster is battered, fried, and then stir fried in a sauce with ginger and scallions.  The ginger scallion lobster served was over-cooked and dried out.  \n\nLastly, there was a steamed fish.  The fish was raw in the middle.   \n\nIt wasn't all bad, there was a crispy chicken with garlic dish that was pretty good, but out of 10 dishes 4 were bad, 5 were okay, and 1 was good.  \n\nDoes 4 bad dishes out of 10 warrant a one star rating?  Well it does when you factor in the service.  The soup, appetizer, and first entree arrived timely, but after that there was a 1 hour gap before we received the next dish.  The dishes were not served with accompanying white rice which I thought was odd.  We had to ask for it, and even the rice took a while to arrive.","I agree with Crystal C., that the dim sum isn't the greatest I've ever had. In fact, I am not sure if the meal was so tasty that it was memorable. I do remember the \"calamari\" was not really calamari, like you would think. It was presented more like a sweet and sour pork (so calamari with LOTS of breading) without any sauce. As a result, the dish was dry and salty.\n\nThe sticky rice was good (hard to mess up), the chicken feet were okay (needed more five spice powder), and the shumai was alright. The noodles were good, and I can see why the cart ran out after the first round. The diners were an equal mix of Asians and Americans. I would've preferred to see more Asians eating (as I am used to in a Chinatown and gives an indication of authenticity), but I do realize we're in Phoenix where the Asian population is not like San Francisco or Houston. \n\nThe meal came to about $30 for two, including jasmine tea. The carts are loud because they are made out of metal and roll on tile. I am also not used to staff members shouting what they have in their cart, like a newspaper boy yelling \"Extra! Extra!\" Christmas music was playing after mid-January, so the atmosphere felt strange. Next time I visit the city, I probably will pass.","Can't say that I was very impressed. Came for dinner in a hopeful and enthusiastic mood since the reviews have been pretty good, but I don't think this place lives up to its current good, but declining rating.\n\nOrdered the Combo fried rice (shrimp, chicken, beef, pork), sesame chicken, and garlic fried chicken. \n\nThe combo fried rice was pretty good, but ended up drinking about 6 glasses of water due to the MSG and sodium content. You'd think that the cook spent his better years in the French Foreign Legion in the Sahara eating salt tablets and developed a taste for them. \n\nThe sesame chicken had a good flavor and a thick brown sweet sauce. I liked it a lot until it got cool and the sauce looked (with that stringy consistency) more like glue. You think I'm kidding? I'm not.\n\nGarlic fried chicken was bad. Just bad. It was like an over roasted dried out half chicken with some dried garlic pieces sprinkled on top. No spices, no flavor, no good. \n\nWe then got all kinds of lip from the waitress when we asked if they could change the channel on the TV from college football, to the Suns game. They made it into this big deal that the \"customers\" wanted to see the football game. Yeah right, it was University of West Virginia Vs. University of Connecticut! I would have believed it if it was a local team....\n\nIt's better than a 1 star joint, but only because it's borderline edible. To be avoided.","This restaurant is located in the Chinese Cultural Center and was the one restaurant that I had not been to. So after some shopping at one of the shops, we stepped in to have dinner.\n\nWe stepped in and asked for a seat for two. We were seated immediately. The place was decorated nicely and a lady playing the piano made for great ambiance.\n\nWe looked at the menu briefly and ordered our drinks, an appetizer, a soup and two main dishes. The drinks came out promptly and so did the rest of the meal. My goodness everything we ordered was very tasty.\n\nThe waiter service itself however was not even close to the decor and food. He never introduced himself, and although he took our order, our food itself was brought out by a kitchen person.\n\nAfter we ordered our waiter really never came back asking if we needed anything else, except to give us our check at the end and that was after the person I was dining with got up and asked a different waiter for it.\n\nIt's amazing how a place with great food, decor, and ambiance can mess it all up by crappy waiter service.","I love Dim Sum, my favorite Chinese dish.\n\nWhen Golden Buddha first open, they have excellent Dim sum. I went there many times, I tell my friend how good it is, But now,  they change cook, taste more like  week old left over. Rumor has it, they change cook every few month, so Quality of cooking change. (not sure if that is true, but that is what I was told.)\nMy advice is; when you walk in the door and the place is pack, = Good Cook. if the place is bare = bad cook. leave immediately. don't waste your money.","If you just \"want\" dim sum, go here. If you are \"craving\" dim sum, go elsewhere (take a 5 hour drive west to neighboring state, California).\n\nAnyway, I've been visiting Golden Buddha in the noontime for roughly 2 years now. I believe they moved from their original site (7th St. & Osborn), formerly \"China Doll.\" Relocation brought along better atmosphere and smiling faces. This does not mean, better dim sum. But since we are in Phoenix, I will settle for what they have to offer. \n\nBe mindful of the dim sum tab. It's itemized high-medium-low. \n\nShaomai can be found as combinations of pork/mushroom, shrimp, or shark fin (which should not be confused as true shark bits, as the shaomai is prepared to look like a shark's fin). These picks are okay...perhaps on a better day shao mai will be served in less-rigid, or fresher wrappers. Potstickers are okay as well, just the usual scallion and pork, and dry wrapper. The baby pork ribs in light black bean sauce and jalapenos is alright, but sometimes lacks in taste. Tripe is also served in its bare minimum...so if you enjoy the texture and flavor of tripe, try this with its clear sauce and thinly sliced carrots and celery.  \nBuche (that's what I call it), or fried sesame balls are also available, although if you wait until dessert, they will also be a bit stiff. There are a few other things that may be \"spotted\" but are not worth mentioning. \n\nDon't order from their lunch menu, as you can find these over-salted dishes at Panda Express anyway. \n\nOverall, dim sum at Golden Buddha is a place to go if you are around the vicinity and feel like having something apart from the usual fast food. However, discriminating palates- beware.","Not impressed with this place at all. This was not the friendliest place around, maybe because of the language barrier (most or all were clearly native Chinese speakers), or maybe just the attitude of the employees.\n\nI ordered the sweet and sour chicken lunch, which came with the typical egg drop soup, crab rangoon, and egg roll. The soup was ok - maybe it's just me, but I prefer a real spoon to the scoop that they gave me. The egg roll was tiny and not that great, and the crab rangoon was ok, but maybe a little undercooked. The chicken wasn't bad, but nothing special, as was the rice and other stuff on the plate.\n\nOverall, this was just not my kind of Chinese place.","Disappointing.  Mediocre at best.  I am staying at the Aloft hotel in phoenix and ordered some delivery. I ordered a couple american chinese food staples: general tso's chicken, dumplings and hot&sour soup.  Soup had zero flavor, dumplings tasted freezer burned and processed.  General tso chicken was ehh. \n\nA lot of good reviews on here so it must be for eat in and for their dim sum.  Don't order delivery, you will be left hungry and unsatisfied.","Went there on Saturday for early lunch.  My wife did the dim sum, it was okay, we were both disgusted by the sugar cane shrimp; but the rest was good.  \n\nI ordered the chicken szechwuan, the waitress warned me it was \"spicy\" the reason I ordered it.  It came out delicious, but not what I would call spicy.  Overall its hard to find good Chinese in the valley and I would call this good without hesitation.","So I was referred to this place from the front desk of my hotel. I'm from SF so I'm coming from a place with really good chinese food. \n\nThe dim sum is just \"ok\" nothing for me to write home about. The one dish that I really liked was the chinese broccoli cooked with garlic sauce. Yum yum yum.  It's in a big bowl, not oily, not saucy, just really good. I think it's $7.50.  \n\nIt's a somewhat pricey and just like all chinese restaurants, it's not the cleanest.  The chair was filthy.  the dishes weren't all that great.  I wouldn't go back unless I want the chinese broccoli.  \n\nSo I went on a Sunday and it was not crowded at all. There's not a huge asian population  in Phoenix (not that I could tell) so I don't think there's a high demand for dim sum.  And also, I sooooooo felt like taking a pic of this, but a Mexican lady was pushing one of the dim sum carts. That is unheard of in SF.  This is a mainly mandarin restaurant and the dim sum places I go are usually cantonese.  Not a big deal though since the dishes look the same. \n\nDude, there was a turtle in the fish tank that I saw as I left.  I hope they don't eat that!","A Premier Chinese Atmosphere,\nThe Chinese cultural center and Asian Garden produces an Asain atmosphere that can be recognized from the 202.  \n With Dim Sum served this location earns its respect from the local community.\n\nDim Sum tip,  You have to be smart with the Dim Sum ladies they look nice innocent but they are professional sales people that will sell you more dishes than you need before you know what to do.  \n\nI love the desserts here ask the server to see the dessert tray.","This restaurant has a bit of an identity crisis. It is in the Chinese cultural center, but serves Japanese beer (Kirin on tap!) and the live piano music is American pop. We had to ask for chopsticks.\n\nHaving said that, the service was professional. Our waiter held a hot appetizer for one of our party who was away from the table so that it would not be cold when he returned. We were asked frequently--and not too frequently--if things were ok both by our waiter and the manager/proprietor.\n\nThe food was ok-to-good. Fried shrimp egg rolls were dainty but yummy. Duck was tasty but very chewy. Kung-pao chicken was pleasantly spiced. Plenty of rice. A pitcher of ice water with lemon was left at the table. \n\nAtmosphere was also pleasant. Chairs comfortable, tables spaced well, restrooms large and clean...and there is indeed a large golden Buddha by the entrance.","I took a group of friends here and relatives other times. The place is consistently good for Dim-sum during lunch. It is typical Chinese and nothing fancy.\n\nWhat helps this place is the moat scenery.  3 stars for visiting here based on convenience since there are similar places in town.","Having grown up in Hong Kong and having eaten dim sum in London, NY, LA, SF and Vancouver (actually Richmond), I can confidently say I know my dim sum.\n\nGood selection of well-executed dim sum when the carts actually come around and there's anything left in it.  I'd give it 4 stars for food but the wait definitely detracted from the whole experience.\n\nI think the problem with Golden Buddha is that they can't handle the heavy flow on weekends.  There's not enough regular dim sum eaters like LA that can sustain a steady flow of diners throughout the week, forcing restaurants like Golden Buddha to depend heavily on extra part-time help on weekends.  \n\nDim sum takes serious skill so the chef still ends up doing most of the work.  When we looked into the kitchen, we saw a Chinese woman doing most of the cooking herself.  No wonder it took forever for a cart to come out and when it does, it's swarmed on by a pack of vultures.\n\nIf you're willing to eat at a more simply decorated place with a smaller menu, I'd highly recommend China Chan.  It's much more relaxed - usually no wait on weekends.  An experienced chef makes all the dim sum himself so the menu's much shorter but all the classics are on it.  Anything steamed is made to order so is very fresh.","Situated in the Chinese Cultural Center near the SkyHarbor Airport, this was another pleasant find. All I had was the Dim Sum menu, and I would say this is the best you're gonna get in Phoenix. Still worth the stop to get your Dim Sum fix. The cart ladies were pleasant and very happy to converse with me in Cantonese. Only downside was the chicken sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaves, naw mei gai, was way overcooked, and mushy.","Do you want to eat Chinese Food in an elegant environment on a Friday night in Phoenix? \n\nBe entertained by classic, quiet standards being played live on a piano while you dine?\n\nAre you 50 years old and Caucasian?\n\nThen the Golden Buddha is the place for you! \n\nIts in the Chinese Cultural Center Mall on 44th, and a popular weekend spot for Dim Sum. For a DIm Sum starved Valley of the Sun, Golden Buddha's is decent. \n\nFor dinner, though, it is awfully Americanized and not very authentic Chinese. But with a bunch of American customers coming for dinner, what do you expect? They probably think they are getting \"real Chinese\" food by going to the Chinese Mall, but then again, they are used to PF Chang's or Stix normally in their neighborhood, so this is a step up.\n\nThe best thing about this place is the decor, which is clean and nice, with a Hong Kong Junk boat design covering the ceiling from the bar into the dining room. The next best thing is the Piano interludes on weekend nights. The service is next, which is a little overly eager to remove your plate, and the last thing is the food. \n\nThey do give decent portions. I ordered Guo Teh (potstickers) and got 6 fat ones. But they weren't served with the usual soy, chili oil and vinegar, but a soy and green onions mixture. The Mapo Tofu was ok, as they used a nice silky tofu, which was nice, but no green onions, and sliced black mushrooms instead, which I like, but not in this dish.\n\nCome here for the ambiance and music in the evenings, or on the weekend days for Dim Sum.","Decent dim sum, especially to be found in the middle of the desert. Sadly, the best food I've had in Phoenix.","This place is a little difficult for me to review.  I was staying at the Hampton Inn across the street and this is the closest restaurant so off I went.\n\nI walked in and the owner or manager met me at the door and asked \"how many\"?\n\nI told him I wanted to order take out and handed me a menu and pointed to the waiting area which was covered in newspapers.  I chose to go to the bar, order a glass of wine, and peruse the menu.\n\nThe drinks are expensive but I didn't think the food was.  Less than $10 for my Mongolian Chicken which came with white sticky rice and a fortune cookie.  When ordering I asked if I could have fried rice instead of white rice but was told \"no\".  Most places allow this for a nominal fee.\n\nFine by me.  Give the white rice.  Food was prepared and their to-go boxes were a lot better than the standard white Chinese \"to go\" boxes.  They also included the plastic-ware, napkin, and soy sauce, which a lot of places forget.\n\nLooking around I found a whole lot of goodness along with a couple disappointments.  Most notably the newspaper strewn about and behind the bar, to the right were a lot of boxes stacked in an unsightly fashion.  I could have been a little more presentable in my opinion.\n\nI peeked into the dining room because I wanted to see if the piano music was piped in or live.  It was live which was very nice. Also, the dinning room looked very nice and cozy.\n\nAs I was leaving the same man who greeted me upon entering made sure to wish me a good evening.  My initial impression of the man was that he was surly and testy but that's just how he comes off.\n\nThe food was very good.  The Mongolian sauce was mixture of sweet with spice and the chicken and vegetables all tasted fresh.","My husband and I went there Saturday, the service was great!  Our friends were going to be late so they told us to start.  And start we did!\nThey were serving Dim Sum, something we had never tried, so glad we did, it was wonderful, hubby wouldn't do the chicken feet, but I think next time I will, it looked very good.\nOur friends showed up and ordered their food, and ate all of it, they said that usually they take food home, but it was so good they had to eat all of it!\nWe will be going back very soon!","Let's see, over 50... check \nold white man...........check \neats dinner ...............check \nlistens to the piano  check \n\nwow this must be the place for me, I mean after all it is in a Chinese mall, no make that a Chinese Cultural Center. How could I possibly have discerning taste with such trickery to get me here to eat. \nDude if you are going to rate a restaurant no need to degrade others with your arrogance. \nFool is my review of wanugee N. \n\nNow on the restaurant. The last time we were here the food was not good, the piano was too loud and the waitress had a real attitude. IT won't keep me from going back as I have had good meals and wait service too. \n\nBack to wanugee N. I do not expect any place in Phx. to have authentic Chinese food, by that I mean the street food one finds in China. \nBut I do expect what I fork in to my mouth is worth what I am going to fork over in cost. Even an old white guy like me can tell the difference between good and bad food. No matter what it is called.","Okay so Ive been glum the past few days as I have an impending birthday. Every year this time I get all down in the dumps.. not that I'm not happy with my life cause life is good. Its more like getting further away from my youth and closer to being well, old. All of my grandparents were crotchety, sourpuss drama queens.. is that my fate? Can I break the mold or am I to going to be a crotchety sourpuss?\n\nSo as I contemplate and figure out what I'm going to do with my birthday baggage I decide to squash it with food. All weekend Ive been eating out and having a good time. This is one of the few times outside of a vacation where I will live it completely and to the near of sheer gluttony. So why not dim sum? \n\nIve chowed much dim sum in my 36 years of earthen wear.. of course some good and some bad. I have never been to a place where every dish was great.. Golden Buddha is no exception to this.. they do the basics well enough and have enough funky cool Asian style to keep me interested in returning. The carts around 1130 flow well but around noon it' s full blown freeway action! In fact there might be some road kill in there based on some of the looks on that last steam cart.. \n\nMe and 3 others who were feeling my pain ordered 14, count them, 14 different dishes. One of my friends is from Georgia and had never had dim sum but he is so courageous and unflinching that he was just a blast. Just the shot in the arm to get me out of my funk. I remember the first time I had dim sum.. my eyes wide open, nostrils flared and excited to see what was under the next steamer lid. That was him today.. one exciting thing after the next.. he was even willing to try chicken feet but this is one of those dishes not done very well here. \n\nMy friend took me back to a time where I was younger and less experienced. He looked up to me to guide him through the noodles, bao and sui mai.. like a big brother.. I'm privileged that I could show him something new and exciting and he was so into it! So instead of feeling sorry for myself I felt experienced and useful.. that there is something I can give back to others.. that its not all about me and me aging but about what can be shared with others.\n\nThere is so much more to do, give and feel in this short time we are here.. and Ill do it to, one bite at a time.","The best to be found in land locked Arizona.  My favorite sticky rice is here.  They have dim sum every day, but not a huge selection, though you can order off the menu.  I think it is much bigger on the weekends.  I'm just happy I can get my fix 7 days a week.  Beautiful gardens to walk through, with fish ponds, and a 99 market next door!","I ate at Golden Buddha a few weeks ago.  We ate at the restaurant after a day at the zoo with our 4 year old and had a blast.  The piano bar played tunes for my daughter and the staff was more than accommodating.  The general tso chicken was better than anything I can get in Tucson.  The soup was chocked full of fresh, read FRESH, not canned, vegetables.  All in all, I was very satisfied with the meal and the service.  Plus the decor is very nice, clean and cheery. \n\nEat at Golden Buddha.","For those who gave this place low marks, forgive me. I really like this place. Now I haven't tried various dim sum places so I'm reserving the right to downgrade the place as needed. The variety of food is plentiful, and the carts just keep on coming. I love the steamed pork buns, and the shiu mai (not sure if I spelled that correctly). Yesterday, my favorite pick was the deep fried rolls of taro and shrimp. YUM! I have never ordered from their menu so I can only talk about their dim sum. My friends and I try to go eat dim sum almost every Sunday. It's a cheap way to try new foods, and if you don't like it, well.. you can get away with pushing it aside with minimal guilt. Give it a try! You might be surprised.","I like Golden Buddha, have taken many friends there for Dim Sum.  \nTry not to \"hit\" the dumpling cart to heavy; otherwise cannot finish it to the dessert cart (LOL).\nLove the jasmine tea and the staff willing to help you if you do not understand the what each item is.\nSingapore Rice Noodles a favorite, along with any of the shrimp dumplings; also the broccoli and green beans.\nOnly wish that the carts with eggplant stuffed with shrimp or green peppers with shrimp were not on \"heated\" carts; by the time it gets to you the food is cold.\nOnly concern is that went on 22MAY2010 at 1:30PM; there was a closed sign due to electricity???\nREVISED: 26MAY2010 - called this evening - looks like they are back open again.","I've been to the Golden Buddha on several occasions and it is my favorite, by far, for honest Chinese food. \nWhile I've sampled everything from their vegetarian to their beef, I love their mandarin chicken. More recently, I was delighted to relive the wonders of their Kung Pao Chicken and Beef with Broccoli. \nI absolutely love the egg drop soup and mini crab rangoons that come with the meal.","The very first time I went to Golden Buddha was with my BFF and it was our first dim sum experience. Little did I know this would forever change my life and eating experiences. Although I must admit that first time was a bit awkward.\n\nGB wisely takes reservations which was wonderful (even though it wasn't crazy busy). Our assorted dim sum plates were flavorful and fresh. And the carts seemed to be in constant rotation so we were never too far from a good selection.\n\nWhat really helps GB is its location. The Cofco Center is an experience in itself, where one can have herbs specially blended, select a fresh member of marine life to take home and cook or browse through a store with one of the largest selections of Buddhas and hand fans I've experienced outside of San Francisco.","I've been to Golden Buddha a few times and have not been disappointed. \n\nThey have a LARGE selection of Dim Sum and if you're not careful you can get carried away.\n\nTry and get there early and you'll get the best and most fresh selection.\nMake sure you walk around the garden when you're done.","Probably the most comprehensive Chinese menu in the Valley.  Pick from well over 100 dishes, but if you want the best order the Peking Duck.  Everything else is very good, but without a wow factor.  You'll see lots of Chinese people in this massive restaurant, which probably means they're doing a fine job in the kitchen.","I very much enjoyed eating here. Food was great. Fairly fast service. Wasn't expensive either for the 4 of us.","Golden Buddha has GREAT dim sum.  Their prices are reasonable and the staff is very polite wheeling their little carts.  I tend to go on the weekend because there is more selection but they do dim sum throughout the week.  They also have some very authentic dishes on the menu for those who are more of the adventurous types.  Be sure to say hello to the turtles the next time you go.","This place in the Chinese Cultural Center has a very pretty and elegant bar area. I was pleased to learn that they had some very reasonable and delicious happy hour snacks. This is a good place for a Pina Colada. I had one by myself along with some dumplings and fried shrimp appetizer. Sadly I never brought anyone else here with me. It was happy hour heaven but you know? A lot of my friends in AZ pretty much hang out in one neighborhood or another and nobody I know really lives close to the Buddha.\nThe airport is pretty close by. This might be a good pre-flight send-off location.","I have had dim sum in New Orleans and Phoenix (not SF), and this is about equal to the best of New Orleans as far as flavor.\nAs for ambiance, today was a good day. I've had dim sum here about a dozen times, and have had very good service and quality 90% of the time, including weekends. I have had bad days here, but since today was good, I'll rate accordingly. It's closer to a 4.5, but since I can't give half-stars, I rounded up.\nDon't expect me to give these the right names, but... I was less than impressed with the bbq pork balls. They tasted too much like honey and the beef was minimal. The bbq sauce tasted bottled. Outside of that, their herbal hot tea is delicious even on a hot day.\nThe shu mai were very good, and the shrimp in a spinach dumpling was fantastic. A definite don't miss is their sticky rice in lotus leaf. It's among the best I've had anywhere. Just be careful; you'll find bones in it every once in a while. Go for any of their steamed dumplings; they're very flavorful. As others have said, I love the Chinese broccoli, but you'll only find it on the carts on weekends. Otherwise order it off the menu.\nToday (11:30 lunch) the carts came around often, and everything except the pork buns was piping hot and fresh. By the way, despite the price increases, even the sticky rice was considered a medium size entree, and the two of us eating there escaped with a bill under $20 and we were done in under 30 minutes.\nI strongly recommend the dim sum here, whether you've had it a million times or have never had it before. You usually won't be disappointed.","I don't really understand the poor reviews on this place.....maybe it depends on the day you go? We went on a Sunday, it was crazy busy, but service was great! (of course, my view of customer service is a little different then the rest... I used to live on an island where you were just happy to find what you were looking for, let alone expect good customer service) Anyways, our server was very sweet! Always had a smile on her face. The carts served us promplty and none of the food was cold. They always had whatever we wanted (I hate having to wait for the next cart).\n\nNow, as for the actual dim sum and food.......holy cow, to die for! So flavorful and fresh!! The broccoli makes you sing...and the wine noodles, make you cry. You leave with very weird mixed emotions, but mostly a happy belly full of yummy food.\n\nIn my opinion, this is the best dim sum I have been able to find in Phx. I'm ditching my previous spot (Mekong Palace) and will be back to Golden Buddha when the dim sum monster strikes again!"],"type":["Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low

waiter was to be found about ten minutes later they gave us our water and left again! It wasn't even busy! There were only TWO dim sum carts floating around somewhere. Then our waiter finally came around and took our orders of lunch entrees. The food was not even that good as the reviews that are posted on here. When we came up to pay, the bill was super overpriced. I will not be returning here, I am better off eating at Great Wall Cuisine.","If this place had zero stars I would have given them that ! Let me start off by saying I was so excited to read all great reviews so maybe I just came in on a off day? We walked in and were seated came over and asked if we wanted water or tea I guess they don't serve anything Else, Then we placed an order pork dumplings and sticky rice nasty! Then I asked if they served egg rolls they said they were out!!! they pushed their little carts around with hot plates that basically steam the food and is not fresh and what you get is soggy poor customer service we had to get up and look for someone to give us our tab so we could get the heck out of there are get some real food. It looked like it would be a great place for groups of people would not recommend if you are on mission for what you want and want to place an order but it could be a fun experience for some people.","You walk into a Chinese restaurant on a Saturday afternoon for dim sum and you expect the place to be PACKED.  Well, walking in to a pretty much empty dining room, it's a VERY CLEAR SIGN.  But my friend insisted and I was very hesitant for good reasons.  Another indicator, the majority of the patrons were NON Asian.  \n\nFood: You walk in and you see carts of the food by the entrance to the dining room.  Umm, I thought dim sum should come right off the steamer and into the carts and they roll it around, not sitting around.  The dim sum was garbage.  It had the typical selection, but at minimum.  \n\nService: It's ok.  But it doesn't make up for the horrible food.\n\nBottom line: NO WAY!  Stay away!","I've been here many times...Mother's Day with family, dim sum with book club, etc. But I will not go back again.  I stopped in to ask the owner about a donation or reduced price for a class of under-privileged kids that I volunteer with.  His reaction was to scoff and shoo me out the door while handing me his card and saying I could email him.  He turned his back and headed off to the messy newspaper-strewn table he haunts between guests arrivals.  Maybe he's a community-minded business owner, but then again, maybe he's not.  I'll be dining elsewhere.","Being from Chicago, we are used to getting authentic Chinese food all the time.  But when we first starting spending a lot of time in Scottsdale/Phoenix, we found it a challenge to get authentic Chinese food.  We were excited to find the Golden Buddha and have made many trips over the years all the way from the Troon North area to get our fix.  However, service has declined to the point where it is no longer worth the aggravation.  We went there last night for Chinese New Year and will never go back.  Granted they were very busy because of a lot of large tables there, but waiting almost an hour to get our food is not acceptable under any circumstance!  45 mins. into our wait, the waitress came back (after we flagged her down to ask about our food) and said one of the dishes we ordered was not available....after 45 mins.!!!! What makes the whole experience an unforgivable one is that the manager/owner is so indifferent and never apologized or offered a discount off the bill...nothing.  When we left, the same manager was at the piano singing in Chinese. Huh?  Other than Nee House in Scottsdale, the search goes on for a restaurant that serves authentic Chinese food closer to home.","I will NEVER go there again.  I reserved a table for a group of 16 people for 5:00 PM on Christmas Eve .  The person on the phone ( I believe the manager) repeatedly asked me to call ahead and give him an accurate head count since he said they'd be swamped that day.  I followed up with him twice.  \nWhen the first couple of us arrived, we had menus shoved in our faces immediately and told we \"Must order now.  Must order now\" because they were going to be busy later on.  The place was practically empty.  As each person arrived, they were treated the same way. \nWe rushed and placed our orders and then they brought out our checks WAY before we saw any sign of our food.  I have never in my life been treated so rudely by a restaurant.\nIt was utter chaos when the food started coming out while everyone struggled to get the correct dish they ordered.  One person didn't get her food until we were all just about finished eating. \nOne top of all that, the food wasn't even good.  I've had better Kung Pao Chicken at Panda Express!\nAfter being rushed through our meal, the place wasn't even half full by the time we left.  I thought being at the Cultural Center, this restaurant would be a sure thing but boy was I wrong.  Lovely way to spend Christmas Eve..","If you are looking a chinese restaurant to host a big party look some other than the Golden Buddah.  I recently attended a banquet at the Golden Buddah and I was shocked at the level of quality of food and service.  Of the 10 dishes served 4 were nearly inedible.  \n\nThere was a crab claw appetizer, most chinese restaurants prepare this dish by taking a crab claw surrounding it with ground shrimp, batter and then deep fry.  At Golden Buddah, the crab claw served was mostly batter.  \n\nThe shark fin soup served was mostly broth.  Shark fin is an expensive ingredient and most places usually use imitation shark fin, but come on at least put something in there so that I know I'm eating soup and not dirty sink water.  \n\nGinger scallion lobster is battered, fried, and then stir fried in a sauce with ginger and scallions.  The ginger scallion lobster served was over-cooked and dried out.  \n\nLastly, there was a steamed fish.  The fish was raw in the middle.   \n\nIt wasn't all bad, there was a crispy chicken with garlic dish that was pretty good, but out of 10 dishes 4 were bad, 5 were okay, and 1 was good.  \n\nDoes 4 bad dishes out of 10 warrant a one star rating?  Well it does when you factor in the service.  The soup, appetizer, and first entree arrived timely, but after that there was a 1 hour gap before we received the next dish.  The dishes were not served with accompanying white rice which I thought was odd.  We had to ask for it, and even the rice took a while to arrive.","I agree with Crystal C., that the dim sum isn't the greatest I've ever had. In fact, I am not sure if the meal was so tasty that it was memorable. I do remember the \"calamari\" was not really calamari, like you would think. It was presented more like a sweet and sour pork (so calamari with LOTS of breading) without any sauce. As a result, the dish was dry and salty.\n\nThe sticky rice was good (hard to mess up), the chicken feet were okay (needed more five spice powder), and the shumai was alright. The noodles were good, and I can see why the cart ran out after the first round. The diners were an equal mix of Asians and Americans. I would've preferred to see more Asians eating (as I am used to in a Chinatown and gives an indication of authenticity), but I do realize we're in Phoenix where the Asian population is not like San Francisco or Houston. \n\nThe meal came to about $30 for two, including jasmine tea. The carts are loud because they are made out of metal and roll on tile. I am also not used to staff members shouting what they have in their cart, like a newspaper boy yelling \"Extra! Extra!\" Christmas music was playing after mid-January, so the atmosphere felt strange. Next time I visit the city, I probably will pass.","Can't say that I was very impressed. Came for dinner in a hopeful and enthusiastic mood since the reviews have been pretty good, but I don't think this place lives up to its current good, but declining rating.\n\nOrdered the Combo fried rice (shrimp, chicken, beef, pork), sesame chicken, and garlic fried chicken. \n\nThe combo fried rice was pretty good, but ended up drinking about 6 glasses of water due to the MSG and sodium content. You'd think that the cook spent his better years in the French Foreign Legion in the Sahara eating salt tablets and developed a taste for them. \n\nThe sesame chicken had a good flavor and a thick brown sweet sauce. I liked it a lot until it got cool and the sauce looked (with that stringy consistency) more like glue. You think I'm kidding? I'm not.\n\nGarlic fried chicken was bad. Just bad. It was like an over roasted dried out half chicken with some dried garlic pieces sprinkled on top. No spices, no flavor, no good. \n\nWe then got all kinds of lip from the waitress when we asked if they could change the channel on the TV from college football, to the Suns game. They made it into this big deal that the \"customers\" wanted to see the football game. Yeah right, it was University of West Virginia Vs. University of Connecticut! I would have believed it if it was a local team....\n\nIt's better than a 1 star joint, but only because it's borderline edible. To be avoided.","This restaurant is located in the Chinese Cultural Center and was the one restaurant that I had not been to. So after some shopping at one of the shops, we stepped in to have dinner.\n\nWe stepped in and asked for a seat for two. We were seated immediately. The place was decorated nicely and a lady playing the piano made for great ambiance.\n\nWe looked at the menu briefly and ordered our drinks, an appetizer, a soup and two main dishes. The drinks came out promptly and so did the rest of the meal. My goodness everything we ordered was very tasty.\n\nThe waiter service itself however was not even close to the decor and food. He never introduced himself, and although he took our order, our food itself was brought out by a kitchen person.\n\nAfter we ordered our waiter really never came back asking if we needed anything else, except to give us our check at the end and that was after the person I was dining with got up and asked a different waiter for it.\n\nIt's amazing how a place with great food, decor, and ambiance can mess it all up by crappy waiter service.","I love Dim Sum, my favorite Chinese dish.\n\nWhen Golden Buddha first open, they have excellent Dim sum. I went there many times, I tell my friend how good it is, But now,  they change cook, taste more like  week old left over. Rumor has it, they change cook every few month, so Quality of cooking change. (not sure if that is true, but that is what I was told.)\nMy advice is; when you walk in the door and the place is pack, = Good Cook. if the place is bare = bad cook. leave immediately. don't waste your money.","If you just \"want\" dim sum, go here. If you are \"craving\" dim sum, go elsewhere (take a 5 hour drive west to neighboring state, California).\n\nAnyway, I've been visiting Golden Buddha in the noontime for roughly 2 years now. I believe they moved from their original site (7th St. & Osborn), formerly \"China Doll.\" Relocation brought along better atmosphere and smiling faces. This does not mean, better dim sum. But since we are in Phoenix, I will settle for what they have to offer. \n\nBe mindful of the dim sum tab. It's itemized high-medium-low. \n\nShaomai can be found as combinations of pork/mushroom, shrimp, or shark fin (which should not be confused as true shark bits, as the shaomai is prepared to look like a shark's fin). These picks are okay...perhaps on a better day shao mai will be served in less-rigid, or fresher wrappers. Potstickers are okay as well, just the usual scallion and pork, and dry wrapper. The baby pork ribs in light black bean sauce and jalapenos is alright, but sometimes lacks in taste. Tripe is also served in its bare minimum...so if you enjoy the texture and flavor of tripe, try this with its clear sauce and thinly sliced carrots and celery.  \nBuche (that's what I call it), or fried sesame balls are also available, although if you wait until dessert, they will also be a bit stiff. There are a few other things that may be \"spotted\" but are not worth mentioning. \n\nDon't order from their lunch menu, as you can find these over-salted dishes at Panda Express anyway. \n\nOverall, dim sum at Golden Buddha is a place to go if you are around the vicinity and feel like having something apart from the usual fast food. However, discriminating palates- beware.","Not impressed with this place at all. This was not the friendliest place around, maybe because of the language barrier (most or all were clearly native Chinese speakers), or maybe just the attitude of the employees.\n\nI ordered the sweet and sour chicken lunch, which came with the typical egg drop soup, crab rangoon, and egg roll. The soup was ok - maybe it's just me, but I prefer a real spoon to the scoop that they gave me. The egg roll was tiny and not that great, and the crab rangoon was ok, but maybe a little undercooked. The chicken wasn't bad, but nothing special, as was the rice and other stuff on the plate.\n\nOverall, this was just not my kind of Chinese place.","Disappointing.  Mediocre at best.  I am staying at the Aloft hotel in phoenix and ordered some delivery. I ordered a couple american chinese food staples: general tso's chicken, dumplings and hot&sour soup.  Soup had zero flavor, dumplings tasted freezer burned and processed.  General tso chicken was ehh. \n\nA lot of good reviews on here so it must be for eat in and for their dim sum.  Don't order delivery, you will be left hungry and unsatisfied.","Went there on Saturday for early lunch.  My wife did the dim sum, it was okay, we were both disgusted by the sugar cane shrimp; but the rest was good.  \n\nI ordered the chicken szechwuan, the waitress warned me it was \"spicy\" the reason I ordered it.  It came out delicious, but not what I would call spicy.  Overall its hard to find good Chinese in the valley and I would call this good without hesitation.","So I was referred to this place from the front desk of my hotel. I'm from SF so I'm coming from a place with really good chinese food. \n\nThe dim sum is just \"ok\" nothing for me to write home about. The one dish that I really liked was the chinese broccoli cooked with garlic sauce. Yum yum yum.  It's in a big bowl, not oily, not saucy, just really good. I think it's $7.50.  \n\nIt's a somewhat pricey and just like all chinese restaurants, it's not the cleanest.  The chair was filthy.  the dishes weren't all that great.  I wouldn't go back unless I want the chinese broccoli.  \n\nSo I went on a Sunday and it was not crowded at all. There's not a huge asian population  in Phoenix (not that I could tell) so I don't think there's a high demand for dim sum.  And also, I sooooooo felt like taking a pic of this, but a Mexican lady was pushing one of the dim sum carts. That is unheard of in SF.  This is a mainly mandarin restaurant and the dim sum places I go are usually cantonese.  Not a big deal though since the dishes look the same. \n\nDude, there was a turtle in the fish tank that I saw as I left.  I hope they don't eat that!","A Premier Chinese Atmosphere,\nThe Chinese cultural center and Asian Garden produces an Asain atmosphere that can be recognized from the 202.  \n With Dim Sum served this location earns its respect from the local community.\n\nDim Sum tip,  You have to be smart with the Dim Sum ladies they look nice innocent but they are professional sales people that will sell you more dishes than you need before you know what to do.  \n\nI love the desserts here ask the server to see the dessert tray.","This restaurant has a bit of an identity crisis. It is in the Chinese cultural center, but serves Japanese beer (Kirin on tap!) and the live piano music is American pop. We had to ask for chopsticks.\n\nHaving said that, the service was professional. Our waiter held a hot appetizer for one of our party who was away from the table so that it would not be cold when he returned. We were asked frequently--and not too frequently--if things were ok both by our waiter and the manager/proprietor.\n\nThe food was ok-to-good. Fried shrimp egg rolls were dainty but yummy. Duck was tasty but very chewy. Kung-pao chicken was pleasantly spiced. Plenty of rice. A pitcher of ice water with lemon was left at the table. \n\nAtmosphere was also pleasant. Chairs comfortable, tables spaced well, restrooms large and clean...and there is indeed a large golden Buddha by the entrance.","I took a group of friends here and relatives other times. The place is consistently good for Dim-sum during lunch. It is typical Chinese and nothing fancy.\n\nWhat helps this place is the moat scenery.  3 stars for visiting here based on convenience since there are similar places in town.","Having grown up in Hong Kong and having eaten dim sum in London, NY, LA, SF and Vancouver (actually Richmond), I can confidently say I know my dim sum.\n\nGood selection of well-executed dim sum when the carts actually come around and there's anything left in it.  I'd give it 4 stars for food but the wait definitely detracted from the whole experience.\n\nI think the problem with Golden Buddha is that they can't handle the heavy flow on weekends.  There's not enough regular dim sum eaters like LA that can sustain a steady flow of diners throughout the week, forcing restaurants like Golden Buddha to depend heavily on extra part-time help on weekends.  \n\nDim sum takes serious skill so the chef still ends up doing most of the work.  When we looked into the kitchen, we saw a Chinese woman doing most of the cooking herself.  No wonder it took forever for a cart to come out and when it does, it's swarmed on by a pack of vultures.\n\nIf you're willing to eat at a more simply decorated place with a smaller menu, I'd highly recommend China Chan.  It's much more relaxed - usually no wait on weekends.  An experienced chef makes all the dim sum himself so the menu's much shorter but all the classics are on it.  Anything steamed is made to order so is very fresh.","Situated in the Chinese Cultural Center near the SkyHarbor Airport, this was another pleasant find. All I had was the Dim Sum menu, and I would say this is the best you're gonna get in Phoenix. Still worth the stop to get your Dim Sum fix. The cart ladies were pleasant and very happy to converse with me in Cantonese. Only downside was the chicken sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaves, naw mei gai, was way overcooked, and mushy.","Do you want to eat Chinese Food in an elegant environment on a Friday night in Phoenix? \n\nBe entertained by classic, quiet standards being played live on a piano while you dine?\n\nAre you 50 years old and Caucasian?\n\nThen the Golden Buddha is the place for you! \n\nIts in the Chinese Cultural Center Mall on 44th, and a popular weekend spot for Dim Sum. For a DIm Sum starved Valley of the Sun, Golden Buddha's is decent. \n\nFor dinner, though, it is awfully Americanized and not very authentic Chinese. But with a bunch of American customers coming for dinner, what do you expect? They probably think they are getting \"real Chinese\" food by going to the Chinese Mall, but then again, they are used to PF Chang's or Stix normally in their neighborhood, so this is a step up.\n\nThe best thing about this place is the decor, which is clean and nice, with a Hong Kong Junk boat design covering the ceiling from the bar into the dining room. The next best thing is the Piano interludes on weekend nights. The service is next, which is a little overly eager to remove your plate, and the last thing is the food. \n\nThey do give decent portions. I ordered Guo Teh (potstickers) and got 6 fat ones. But they weren't served with the usual soy, chili oil and vinegar, but a soy and green onions mixture. The Mapo Tofu was ok, as they used a nice silky tofu, which was nice, but no green onions, and sliced black mushrooms instead, which I like, but not in this dish.\n\nCome here for the ambiance and music in the evenings, or on the weekend days for Dim Sum.","Decent dim sum, especially to be found in the middle of the desert. Sadly, the best food I've had in Phoenix.","This place is a little difficult for me to review.  I was staying at the Hampton Inn across the street and this is the closest restaurant so off I went.\n\nI walked in and the owner or manager met me at the door and asked \"how many\"?\n\nI told him I wanted to order take out and handed me a menu and pointed to the waiting area which was covered in newspapers.  I chose to go to the bar, order a glass of wine, and peruse the menu.\n\nThe drinks are expensive but I didn't think the food was.  Less than $10 for my Mongolian Chicken which came with white sticky rice and a fortune cookie.  When ordering I asked if I could have fried rice instead of white rice but was told \"no\".  Most places allow this for a nominal fee.\n\nFine by me.  Give the white rice.  Food was prepared and their to-go boxes were a lot better than the standard white Chinese \"to go\" boxes.  They also included the plastic-ware, napkin, and soy sauce, which a lot of places forget.\n\nLooking around I found a whole lot of goodness along with a couple disappointments.  Most notably the newspaper strewn about and behind the bar, to the right were a lot of boxes stacked in an unsightly fashion.  I could have been a little more presentable in my opinion.\n\nI peeked into the dining room because I wanted to see if the piano music was piped in or live.  It was live which was very nice. Also, the dinning room looked very nice and cozy.\n\nAs I was leaving the same man who greeted me upon entering made sure to wish me a good evening.  My initial impression of the man was that he was surly and testy but that's just how he comes off.\n\nThe food was very good.  The Mongolian sauce was mixture of sweet with spice and the chicken and vegetables all tasted fresh.","My husband and I went there Saturday, the service was great!  Our friends were going to be late so they told us to start.  And start we did!\nThey were serving Dim Sum, something we had never tried, so glad we did, it was wonderful, hubby wouldn't do the chicken feet, but I think next time I will, it looked very good.\nOur friends showed up and ordered their food, and ate all of it, they said that usually they take food home, but it was so good they had to eat all of it!\nWe will be going back very soon!","Let's see, over 50... check \nold white man...........check \neats dinner ...............check \nlistens to the piano  check \n\nwow this must be the place for me, I mean after all it is in a Chinese mall, no make that a Chinese Cultural Center. How could I possibly have discerning taste with such trickery to get me here to eat. \nDude if you are going to rate a restaurant no need to degrade others with your arrogance. \nFool is my review of wanugee N. \n\nNow on the restaurant. The last time we were here the food was not good, the piano was too loud and the waitress had a real attitude. IT won't keep me from going back as I have had good meals and wait service too. \n\nBack to wanugee N. I do not expect any place in Phx. to have authentic Chinese food, by that I mean the street food one finds in China. \nBut I do expect what I fork in to my mouth is worth what I am going to fork over in cost. Even an old white guy like me can tell the difference between good and bad food. No matter what it is called.","Okay so Ive been glum the past few days as I have an impending birthday. Every year this time I get all down in the dumps.. not that I'm not happy with my life cause life is good. Its more like getting further away from my youth and closer to being well, old. All of my grandparents were crotchety, sourpuss drama queens.. is that my fate? Can I break the mold or am I to going to be a crotchety sourpuss?\n\nSo as I contemplate and figure out what I'm going to do with my birthday baggage I decide to squash it with food. All weekend Ive been eating out and having a good time. This is one of the few times outside of a vacation where I will live it completely and to the near of sheer gluttony. So why not dim sum? \n\nIve chowed much dim sum in my 36 years of earthen wear.. of course some good and some bad. I have never been to a place where every dish was great.. Golden Buddha is no exception to this.. they do the basics well enough and have enough funky cool Asian style to keep me interested in returning. The carts around 1130 flow well but around noon it' s full blown freeway action! In fact there might be some road kill in there based on some of the looks on that last steam cart.. \n\nMe and 3 others who were feeling my pain ordered 14, count them, 14 different dishes. One of my friends is from Georgia and had never had dim sum but he is so courageous and unflinching that he was just a blast. Just the shot in the arm to get me out of my funk. I remember the first time I had dim sum.. my eyes wide open, nostrils flared and excited to see what was under the next steamer lid. That was him today.. one exciting thing after the next.. he was even willing to try chicken feet but this is one of those dishes not done very well here. \n\nMy friend took me back to a time where I was younger and less experienced. He looked up to me to guide him through the noodles, bao and sui mai.. like a big brother.. I'm privileged that I could show him something new and exciting and he was so into it! So instead of feeling sorry for myself I felt experienced and useful.. that there is something I can give back to others.. that its not all about me and me aging but about what can be shared with others.\n\nThere is so much more to do, give and feel in this short time we are here.. and Ill do it to, one bite at a time.","The best to be found in land locked Arizona.  My favorite sticky rice is here.  They have dim sum every day, but not a huge selection, though you can order off the menu.  I think it is much bigger on the weekends.  I'm just happy I can get my fix 7 days a week.  Beautiful gardens to walk through, with fish ponds, and a 99 market next door!","I ate at Golden Buddha a few weeks ago.  We ate at the restaurant after a day at the zoo with our 4 year old and had a blast.  The piano bar played tunes for my daughter and the staff was more than accommodating.  The general tso chicken was better than anything I can get in Tucson.  The soup was chocked full of fresh, read FRESH, not canned, vegetables.  All in all, I was very satisfied with the meal and the service.  Plus the decor is very nice, clean and cheery. \n\nEat at Golden Buddha.","For those who gave this place low marks, forgive me. I really like this place. Now I haven't tried various dim sum places so I'm reserving the right to downgrade the place as needed. The variety of food is plentiful, and the carts just keep on coming. I love the steamed pork buns, and the shiu mai (not sure if I spelled that correctly). Yesterday, my favorite pick was the deep fried rolls of taro and shrimp. YUM! I have never ordered from their menu so I can only talk about their dim sum. My friends and I try to go eat dim sum almost every Sunday. It's a cheap way to try new foods, and if you don't like it, well.. you can get away with pushing it aside with minimal guilt. Give it a try! You might be surprised.","I like Golden Buddha, have taken many friends there for Dim Sum.  \nTry not to \"hit\" the dumpling cart to heavy; otherwise cannot finish it to the dessert cart (LOL).\nLove the jasmine tea and the staff willing to help you if you do not understand the what each item is.\nSingapore Rice Noodles a favorite, along with any of the shrimp dumplings; also the broccoli and green beans.\nOnly wish that the carts with eggplant stuffed with shrimp or green peppers with shrimp were not on \"heated\" carts; by the time it gets to you the food is cold.\nOnly concern is that went on 22MAY2010 at 1:30PM; there was a closed sign due to electricity???\nREVISED: 26MAY2010 - called this evening - looks like they are back open again.","I've been to the Golden Buddha on several occasions and it is my favorite, by far, for honest Chinese food. \nWhile I've sampled everything from their vegetarian to their beef, I love their mandarin chicken. More recently, I was delighted to relive the wonders of their Kung Pao Chicken and Beef with Broccoli. \nI absolutely love the egg drop soup and mini crab rangoons that come with the meal.","The very first time I went to Golden Buddha was with my BFF and it was our first dim sum experience. Little did I know this would forever change my life and eating experiences. Although I must admit that first time was a bit awkward.\n\nGB wisely takes reservations which was wonderful (even though it wasn't crazy busy). Our assorted dim sum plates were flavorful and fresh. And the carts seemed to be in constant rotation so we were never too far from a good selection.\n\nWhat really helps GB is its location. The Cofco Center is an experience in itself, where one can have herbs specially blended, select a fresh member of marine life to take home and cook or browse through a store with one of the largest selections of Buddhas and hand fans I've experienced outside of San Francisco.","I've been to Golden Buddha a few times and have not been disappointed. \n\nThey have a LARGE selection of Dim Sum and if you're not careful you can get carried away.\n\nTry and get there early and you'll get the best and most fresh selection.\nMake sure you walk around the garden when you're done.","Probably the most comprehensive Chinese menu in the Valley.  Pick from well over 100 dishes, but if you want the best order the Peking Duck.  Everything else is very good, but without a wow factor.  You'll see lots of Chinese people in this massive restaurant, which probably means they're doing a fine job in the kitchen.","I very much enjoyed eating here. Food was great. Fairly fast service. Wasn't expensive either for the 4 of us.","Golden Buddha has GREAT dim sum.  Their prices are reasonable and the staff is very polite wheeling their little carts.  I tend to go on the weekend because there is more selection but they do dim sum throughout the week.  They also have some very authentic dishes on the menu for those who are more of the adventurous types.  Be sure to say hello to the turtles the next time you go.","This place in the Chinese Cultural Center has a very pretty and elegant bar area. I was pleased to learn that they had some very reasonable and delicious happy hour snacks. This is a good place for a Pina Colada. I had one by myself along with some dumplings and fried shrimp appetizer. Sadly I never brought anyone else here with me. It was happy hour heaven but you know? A lot of my friends in AZ pretty much hang out in one neighborhood or another and nobody I know really lives close to the Buddha.\nThe airport is pretty close by. This might be a good pre-flight send-off location.","I have had dim sum in New Orleans and Phoenix (not SF), and this is about equal to the best of New Orleans as far as flavor.\nAs for ambiance, today was a good day. I've had dim sum here about a dozen times, and have had very good service and quality 90% of the time, including weekends. I have had bad days here, but since today was good, I'll rate accordingly. It's closer to a 4.5, but since I can't give half-stars, I rounded up.\nDon't expect me to give these the right names, but... I was less than impressed with the bbq pork balls. They tasted too much like honey and the beef was minimal. The bbq sauce tasted bottled. Outside of that, their herbal hot tea is delicious even on a hot day.\nThe shu mai were very good, and the shrimp in a spinach dumpling was fantastic. A definite don't miss is their sticky rice in lotus leaf. It's among the best I've had anywhere. Just be careful; you'll find bones in it every once in a while. Go for any of their steamed dumplings; they're very flavorful. As others have said, I love the Chinese broccoli, but you'll only find it on the carts on weekends. Otherwise order it off the menu.\nToday (11:30 lunch) the carts came around often, and everything except the pork buns was piping hot and fresh. By the way, despite the price increases, even the sticky rice was considered a medium size entree, and the two of us eating there escaped with a bill under $20 and we were done in under 30 minutes.\nI strongly recommend the dim sum here, whether you've had it a million times or have never had it before. You usually won't be disappointed.","I don't really understand the poor reviews on this place.....maybe it depends on the day you go? We went on a Sunday, it was crazy busy, but service was great! (of course, my view of customer service is a little different then the rest... I used to live on an island where you were just happy to find what you were looking for, let alone expect good customer service) Anyways, our server was very sweet! Always had a smile on her face. The carts served us promplty and none of the food was cold. They always had whatever we wanted (I hate having to wait for the next cart).\n\nNow, as for the actual dim sum and food.......holy cow, to die for! So flavorful and fresh!! The broccoli makes you sing...and the wine noodles, make you cry. You leave with very weird mixed emotions, but mostly a happy belly full of yummy food.\n\nIn my opinion, this is the best dim sum I have been able to find in Phx. I'm ditching my previous spot (Mekong Palace) and will be back to Golden Buddha when the dim sum monster strikes again!"],"type":["Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low

hotel and not really having eaten much all day, I was hungry.\n\nThe service was terrible....no one knew what they were doing so it took 10 minutes to get a freaking slice of pizza and then when said pizza came it was NASTY.\n\nMy husband once got a pizza in Milwaukee where they put Kraft singles on it as cheese and Pizza Parma is just behind that for worst pizza ever.","Looking for a quick bite to eat and a local told me this was \"the best pizza in the city.\"  I got a plain slice and a pepperoni slice. Possibly the worst pizza I have ever eaten.  This wouldn't even qualify as pizza in North Jersey.  I ate half of the plain slice because I was starving....then threw both in the garbage.  \n\nIf this is really the best pizza in Pittsburgh... wow.","I ordered from Pizza Parma out of storm necessity. I ordered a chicken parmigiana \"hoagie\", which was dry and luke warm. The potato bacon soup was like something out of a can, except the chunks of potato were hard and undercooked..all pretty nasty and overly salty.\n\nNever order from them.","Zero stars. Came in 10 mins before close. Female manager on duty asked for $100 in exchange for a pizza. When we refused she said she could not serve us because her employees had been working since 9am..,it is currently 2:00 am... Sounds pretty illegal to me","Average pizza. But with ten guys working - and not much business at the moment - it still took twenty minutes to get a slice of pepperoni. I'll walk across the street next time.","My butthole hasn't been right for days, nor my stomach. \n\nWe ordered in because we all had a long day and were set to have a family movie night.\n\nA pizza and hoagie. \n\nThe hoagie wasn't anything to run and go scream from the rooftops about but the pizza was covered in little ass ruining intestinal demons and this I am nearly sure of.\n\nI had to be talked out of sending pizza Parma a bill for several rolls of toilet paper.\n\nBe weary of the pizza, distrustful actually.\n\nYour butthole will thank me for it!","Hubby and I dropped in after a hellish morning at the Social Security office. Hubby loves pizza so we made a stop.\n\nPizza wan't bad, it was actually pretty decent.

Possibly the worst pizza I have ever eaten.  This wouldn't even qualify as pizza in North Jersey.  I ate half of the plain slice because I was starving....then threw both in the garbage.  \n\nIf this is really the best pizza in Pittsburgh... wow.","I ordered from Pizza Parma out of storm necessity. I ordered a chicken parmigiana \"hoagie\", which was dry and luke warm. The potato bacon soup was like something out of a can, except the chunks of potato were hard and undercooked..all pretty nasty and overly salty.\n\nNever order from them.","Zero stars. Came in 10 mins before close. Female manager on duty asked for $100 in exchange for a pizza. When we refused she said she could not serve us because her employees had been working since 9am..,it is currently 2:00 am... Sounds pretty illegal to me","Average pizza. But with ten guys working - and not much business at the moment - it still took twenty minutes to get a slice of pepperoni. I'll walk across the street next time.","My butthole hasn't been right for days, nor my stomach. \n\nWe ordered in because we all had a long day and were set to have a family movie night.\n\nA pizza and hoagie. \n\nThe hoagie wasn't anything to run and go scream from the rooftops about but the pizza was covered in little ass ruining intestinal demons and this I am nearly sure of.\n\nI had to be talked out of sending pizza Parma a bill for several rolls of toilet paper.\n\nBe weary of the pizza, distrustful actually.\n\nYour butthole will thank me for it!","Hubby and I dropped in after a hellish morning at the Social Security office. Hubby loves pizza so we made a stop.\n\nPizza wan't bad, it was actually pretty decent.

waiter was to be found about ten minutes later they gave us our water and left again! It wasn't even busy! There were only TWO dim sum carts floating around somewhere. Then our waiter finally came around and took our orders of lunch entrees. The food was not even that good as the reviews that are posted on here. When we came up to pay, the bill was super overpriced. I will not be returning here, I am better off eating at Great Wall Cuisine.","If this place had zero stars I would have given them that ! Let me start off by saying I was so excited to read all great reviews so maybe I just came in on a off day? We walked in and were seated came over and asked if we wanted water or tea I guess they don't serve anything Else, Then we placed an order pork dumplings and sticky rice nasty! Then I asked if they served egg rolls they said they were out!!! they pushed their little carts around with hot plates that basically steam the food and is not fresh and what you get is soggy poor customer service we had to get up and look for someone to give us our tab so we could get the heck out of there are get some real food. It looked like it would be a great place for groups of people would not recommend if you are on mission for what you want and want to place an order but it could be a fun experience for some people.","You walk into a Chinese restaurant on a Saturday afternoon for dim sum and you expect the place to be PACKED.  Well, walking in to a pretty much empty dining room, it's a VERY CLEAR SIGN.  But my friend insisted and I was very hesitant for good reasons.  Another indicator, the majority of the patrons were NON Asian.  \n\nFood: You walk in and you see carts of the food by the entrance to the dining room.  Umm, I thought dim sum should come right off the steamer and into the carts and they roll it around, not sitting around.  The dim sum was garbage.  It had the typical selection, but at minimum.  \n\nService: It's ok.  But it doesn't make up for the horrible food.\n\nBottom line: NO WAY!  Stay away!","I've been here many times...Mother's Day with family, dim sum with book club, etc. But I will not go back again.  I stopped in to ask the owner about a donation or reduced price for a class of under-privileged kids that I volunteer with.  His reaction was to scoff and shoo me out the door while handing me his card and saying I could email him.  He turned his back and headed off to the messy newspaper-strewn table he haunts between guests arrivals.  Maybe he's a community-minded business owner, but then again, maybe he's not.  I'll be dining elsewhere.","Being from Chicago, we are used to getting authentic Chinese food all the time.  But when we first starting spending a lot of time in Scottsdale/Phoenix, we found it a challenge to get authentic Chinese food.  We were excited to find the Golden Buddha and have made many trips over the years all the way from the Troon North area to get our fix.  However, service has declined to the point where it is no longer worth the aggravation.  We went there last night for Chinese New Year and will never go back.  Granted they were very busy because of a lot of large tables there, but waiting almost an hour to get our food is not acceptable under any circumstance!  45 mins. into our wait, the waitress came back (after we flagged her down to ask about our food) and said one of the dishes we ordered was not available....after 45 mins.!!!! What makes the whole experience an unforgivable one is that the manager/owner is so indifferent and never apologized or offered a discount off the bill...nothing.  When we left, the same manager was at the piano singing in Chinese. Huh?  Other than Nee House in Scottsdale, the search goes on for a restaurant that serves authentic Chinese food closer to home.","I will NEVER go there again.  I reserved a table for a group of 16 people for 5:00 PM on Christmas Eve .  The person on the phone ( I believe the manager) repeatedly asked me to call ahead and give him an accurate head count since he said they'd be swamped that day.  I followed up with him twice.  \nWhen the first couple of us arrived, we had menus shoved in our faces immediately and told we \"Must order now.  Must order now\" because they were going to be busy later on.  The place was practically empty.  As each person arrived, they were treated the same way. \nWe rushed and placed our orders and then they brought out our checks WAY before we saw any sign of our food.  I have never in my life been treated so rudely by a restaurant.\nIt was utter chaos when the food started coming out while everyone struggled to get the correct dish they ordered.  One person didn't get her food until we were all just about finished eating. \nOne top of all that, the food wasn't even good.  I've had better Kung Pao Chicken at Panda Express!\nAfter being rushed through our meal, the place wasn't even half full by the time we left.  I thought being at the Cultural Center, this restaurant would be a sure thing but boy was I wrong.  Lovely way to spend Christmas Eve..","If you are looking a chinese restaurant to host a big party look some other than the Golden Buddah.  I recently attended a banquet at the Golden Buddah and I was shocked at the level of quality of food and service.  Of the 10 dishes served 4 were nearly inedible.  \n\nThere was a crab claw appetizer, most chinese restaurants prepare this dish by taking a crab claw surrounding it with ground shrimp, batter and then deep fry.  At Golden Buddah, the crab claw served was mostly batter.  \n\nThe shark fin soup served was mostly broth.  Shark fin is an expensive ingredient and most places usually use imitation shark fin, but come on at least put something in there so that I know I'm eating soup and not dirty sink water.  \n\nGinger scallion lobster is battered, fried, and then stir fried in a sauce with ginger and scallions.  The ginger scallion lobster served was over-cooked and dried out.  \n\nLastly, there was a steamed fish.  The fish was raw in the middle.   \n\nIt wasn't all bad, there was a crispy chicken with garlic dish that was pretty good, but out of 10 dishes 4 were bad, 5 were okay, and 1 was good.  \n\nDoes 4 bad dishes out of 10 warrant a one star rating?  Well it does when you factor in the service.  The soup, appetizer, and first entree arrived timely, but after that there was a 1 hour gap before we received the next dish.  The dishes were not served with accompanying white rice which I thought was odd.  We had to ask for it, and even the rice took a while to arrive.","I agree with Crystal C., that the dim sum isn't the greatest I've ever had. In fact, I am not sure if the meal was so tasty that it was memorable. I do remember the \"calamari\" was not really calamari, like you would think. It was presented more like a sweet and sour pork (so calamari with LOTS of breading) without any sauce. As a result, the dish was dry and salty.\n\nThe sticky rice was good (hard to mess up), the chicken feet were okay (needed more five spice powder), and the shumai was alright. The noodles were good, and I can see why the cart ran out after the first round. The diners were an equal mix of Asians and Americans. I would've preferred to see more Asians eating (as I am used to in a Chinatown and gives an indication of authenticity), but I do realize we're in Phoenix where the Asian population is not like San Francisco or Houston. \n\nThe meal came to about $30 for two, including jasmine tea. The carts are loud because they are made out of metal and roll on tile. I am also not used to staff members shouting what they have in their cart, like a newspaper boy yelling \"Extra! Extra!\" Christmas music was playing after mid-January, so the atmosphere felt strange. Next time I visit the city, I probably will pass.","Can't say that I was very impressed. Came for dinner in a hopeful and enthusiastic mood since the reviews have been pretty good, but I don't think this place lives up to its current good, but declining rating.\n\nOrdered the Combo fried rice (shrimp, chicken, beef, pork), sesame chicken, and garlic fried chicken. \n\nThe combo fried rice was pretty good, but ended up drinking about 6 glasses of water due to the MSG and sodium content. You'd think that the cook spent his better years in the French Foreign Legion in the Sahara eating salt tablets and developed a taste for them. \n\nThe sesame chicken had a good flavor and a thick brown sweet sauce. I liked it a lot until it got cool and the sauce looked (with that stringy consistency) more like glue. You think I'm kidding? I'm not.\n\nGarlic fried chicken was bad. Just bad. It was like an over roasted dried out half chicken with some dried garlic pieces sprinkled on top. No spices, no flavor, no good. \n\nWe then got all kinds of lip from the waitress when we asked if they could change the channel on the TV from college football, to the Suns game. They made it into this big deal that the \"customers\" wanted to see the football game. Yeah right, it was University of West Virginia Vs. University of Connecticut! I would have believed it if it was a local team....\n\nIt's better than a 1 star joint, but only because it's borderline edible. To be avoided.","This restaurant is located in the Chinese Cultural Center and was the one restaurant that I had not been to. So after some shopping at one of the shops, we stepped in to have dinner.\n\nWe stepped in and asked for a seat for two. We were seated immediately. The place was decorated nicely and a lady playing the piano made for great ambiance.\n\nWe looked at the menu briefly and ordered our drinks, an appetizer, a soup and two main dishes. The drinks came out promptly and so did the rest of the meal. My goodness everything we ordered was very tasty.\n\nThe waiter service itself however was not even close to the decor and food. He never introduced himself, and although he took our order, our food itself was brought out by a kitchen person.\n\nAfter we ordered our waiter really never came back asking if we needed anything else, except to give us our check at the end and that was after the person I was dining with got up and asked a different waiter for it.\n\nIt's amazing how a place with great food, decor, and ambiance can mess it all up by crappy waiter service.","I love Dim Sum, my favorite Chinese dish.\n\nWhen Golden Buddha first open, they have excellent Dim sum. I went there many times, I tell my friend how good it is, But now,  they change cook, taste more like  week old left over. Rumor has it, they change cook every few month, so Quality of cooking change. (not sure if that is true, but that is what I was told.)\nMy advice is; when you walk in the door and the place is pack, = Good Cook. if the place is bare = bad cook. leave immediately. don't waste your money.","If you just \"want\" dim sum, go here. If you are \"craving\" dim sum, go elsewhere (take a 5 hour drive west to neighboring state, California).\n\nAnyway, I've been visiting Golden Buddha in the noontime for roughly 2 years now. I believe they moved from their original site (7th St. & Osborn), formerly \"China Doll.\" Relocation brought along better atmosphere and smiling faces. This does not mean, better dim sum. But since we are in Phoenix, I will settle for what they have to offer. \n\nBe mindful of the dim sum tab. It's itemized high-medium-low. \n\nShaomai can be found as combinations of pork/mushroom, shrimp, or shark fin (which should not be confused as true shark bits, as the shaomai is prepared to look like a shark's fin). These picks are okay...perhaps on a better day shao mai will be served in less-rigid, or fresher wrappers. Potstickers are okay as well, just the usual scallion and pork, and dry wrapper. The baby pork ribs in light black bean sauce and jalapenos is alright, but sometimes lacks in taste. Tripe is also served in its bare minimum...so if you enjoy the texture and flavor of tripe, try this with its clear sauce and thinly sliced carrots and celery.  \nBuche (that's what I call it), or fried sesame balls are also available, although if you wait until dessert, they will also be a bit stiff. There are a few other things that may be \"spotted\" but are not worth mentioning. \n\nDon't order from their lunch menu, as you can find these over-salted dishes at Panda Express anyway. \n\nOverall, dim sum at Golden Buddha is a place to go if you are around the vicinity and feel like having something apart from the usual fast food. However, discriminating palates- beware.","Not impressed with this place at all. This was not the friendliest place around, maybe because of the language barrier (most or all were clearly native Chinese speakers), or maybe just the attitude of the employees.\n\nI ordered the sweet and sour chicken lunch, which came with the typical egg drop soup, crab rangoon, and egg roll. The soup was ok - maybe it's just me, but I prefer a real spoon to the scoop that they gave me. The egg roll was tiny and not that great, and the crab rangoon was ok, but maybe a little undercooked. The chicken wasn't bad, but nothing special, as was the rice and other stuff on the plate.\n\nOverall, this was just not my kind of Chinese place.","Disappointing.  Mediocre at best.  I am staying at the Aloft hotel in phoenix and ordered some delivery. I ordered a couple american chinese food staples: general tso's chicken, dumplings and hot&sour soup.  Soup had zero flavor, dumplings tasted freezer burned and processed.  General tso chicken was ehh. \n\nA lot of good reviews on here so it must be for eat in and for their dim sum.  Don't order delivery, you will be left hungry and unsatisfied.","Went there on Saturday for early lunch.  My wife did the dim sum, it was okay, we were both disgusted by the sugar cane shrimp; but the rest was good.  \n\nI ordered the chicken szechwuan, the waitress warned me it was \"spicy\" the reason I ordered it.  It came out delicious, but not what I would call spicy.  Overall its hard to find good Chinese in the valley and I would call this good without hesitation.","So I was referred to this place from the front desk of my hotel. I'm from SF so I'm coming from a place with really good chinese food. \n\nThe dim sum is just \"ok\" nothing for me to write home about. The one dish that I really liked was the chinese broccoli cooked with garlic sauce. Yum yum yum.  It's in a big bowl, not oily, not saucy, just really good. I think it's $7.50.  \n\nIt's a somewhat pricey and just like all chinese restaurants, it's not the cleanest.  The chair was filthy.  the dishes weren't all that great.  I wouldn't go back unless I want the chinese broccoli.  \n\nSo I went on a Sunday and it was not crowded at all. There's not a huge asian population  in Phoenix (not that I could tell) so I don't think there's a high demand for dim sum.  And also, I sooooooo felt like taking a pic of this, but a Mexican lady was pushing one of the dim sum carts. That is unheard of in SF.  This is a mainly mandarin restaurant and the dim sum places I go are usually cantonese.  Not a big deal though since the dishes look the same. \n\nDude, there was a turtle in the fish tank that I saw as I left.  I hope they don't eat that!","A Premier Chinese Atmosphere,\nThe Chinese cultural center and Asian Garden produces an Asain atmosphere that can be recognized from the 202.  \n With Dim Sum served this location earns its respect from the local community.\n\nDim Sum tip,  You have to be smart with the Dim Sum ladies they look nice innocent but they are professional sales people that will sell you more dishes than you need before you know what to do.  \n\nI love the desserts here ask the server to see the dessert tray.","This restaurant has a bit of an identity crisis. It is in the Chinese cultural center, but serves Japanese beer (Kirin on tap!) and the live piano music is American pop. We had to ask for chopsticks.\n\nHaving said that, the service was professional. Our waiter held a hot appetizer for one of our party who was away from the table so that it would not be cold when he returned. We were asked frequently--and not too frequently--if things were ok both by our waiter and the manager/proprietor.\n\nThe food was ok-to-good. Fried shrimp egg rolls were dainty but yummy. Duck was tasty but very chewy. Kung-pao chicken was pleasantly spiced. Plenty of rice. A pitcher of ice water with lemon was left at the table. \n\nAtmosphere was also pleasant. Chairs comfortable, tables spaced well, restrooms large and clean...and there is indeed a large golden Buddha by the entrance.","I took a group of friends here and relatives other times. The place is consistently good for Dim-sum during lunch. It is typical Chinese and nothing fancy.\n\nWhat helps this place is the moat scenery.  3 stars for visiting here based on convenience since there are similar places in town.","Having grown up in Hong Kong and having eaten dim sum in London, NY, LA, SF and Vancouver (actually Richmond), I can confidently say I know my dim sum.\n\nGood selection of well-executed dim sum when the carts actually come around and there's anything left in it.  I'd give it 4 stars for food but the wait definitely detracted from the whole experience.\n\nI think the problem with Golden Buddha is that they can't handle the heavy flow on weekends.  There's not enough regular dim sum eaters like LA that can sustain a steady flow of diners throughout the week, forcing restaurants like Golden Buddha to depend heavily on extra part-time help on weekends.  \n\nDim sum takes serious skill so the chef still ends up doing most of the work.  When we looked into the kitchen, we saw a Chinese woman doing most of the cooking herself.  No wonder it took forever for a cart to come out and when it does, it's swarmed on by a pack of vultures.\n\nIf you're willing to eat at a more simply decorated place with a smaller menu, I'd highly recommend China Chan.  It's much more relaxed - usually no wait on weekends.  An experienced chef makes all the dim sum himself so the menu's much shorter but all the classics are on it.  Anything steamed is made to order so is very fresh.","Situated in the Chinese Cultural Center near the SkyHarbor Airport, this was another pleasant find. All I had was the Dim Sum menu, and I would say this is the best you're gonna get in Phoenix. Still worth the stop to get your Dim Sum fix. The cart ladies were pleasant and very happy to converse with me in Cantonese. Only downside was the chicken sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaves, naw mei gai, was way overcooked, and mushy.","Do you want to eat Chinese Food in an elegant environment on a Friday night in Phoenix? \n\nBe entertained by classic, quiet standards being played live on a piano while you dine?\n\nAre you 50 years old and Caucasian?\n\nThen the Golden Buddha is the place for you! \n\nIts in the Chinese Cultural Center Mall on 44th, and a popular weekend spot for Dim Sum. For a DIm Sum starved Valley of the Sun, Golden Buddha's is decent. \n\nFor dinner, though, it is awfully Americanized and not very authentic Chinese. But with a bunch of American customers coming for dinner, what do you expect? They probably think they are getting \"real Chinese\" food by going to the Chinese Mall, but then again, they are used to PF Chang's or Stix normally in their neighborhood, so this is a step up.\n\nThe best thing about this place is the decor, which is clean and nice, with a Hong Kong Junk boat design covering the ceiling from the bar into the dining room. The next best thing is the Piano interludes on weekend nights. The service is next, which is a little overly eager to remove your plate, and the last thing is the food. \n\nThey do give decent portions. I ordered Guo Teh (potstickers) and got 6 fat ones. But they weren't served with the usual soy, chili oil and vinegar, but a soy and green onions mixture. The Mapo Tofu was ok, as they used a nice silky tofu, which was nice, but no green onions, and sliced black mushrooms instead, which I like, but not in this dish.\n\nCome here for the ambiance and music in the evenings, or on the weekend days for Dim Sum.","Decent dim sum, especially to be found in the middle of the desert. Sadly, the best food I've had in Phoenix.","This place is a little difficult for me to review.  I was staying at the Hampton Inn across the street and this is the closest restaurant so off I went.\n\nI walked in and the owner or manager met me at the door and asked \"how many\"?\n\nI told him I wanted to order take out and handed me a menu and pointed to the waiting area which was covered in newspapers.  I chose to go to the bar, order a glass of wine, and peruse the menu.\n\nThe drinks are expensive but I didn't think the food was.  Less than $10 for my Mongolian Chicken which came with white sticky rice and a fortune cookie.  When ordering I asked if I could have fried rice instead of white rice but was told \"no\".  Most places allow this for a nominal fee.\n\nFine by me.  Give the white rice.  Food was prepared and their to-go boxes were a lot better than the standard white Chinese \"to go\" boxes.  They also included the plastic-ware, napkin, and soy sauce, which a lot of places forget.\n\nLooking around I found a whole lot of goodness along with a couple disappointments.  Most notably the newspaper strewn about and behind the bar, to the right were a lot of boxes stacked in an unsightly fashion.  I could have been a little more presentable in my opinion.\n\nI peeked into the dining room because I wanted to see if the piano music was piped in or live.  It was live which was very nice. Also, the dinning room looked very nice and cozy.\n\nAs I was leaving the same man who greeted me upon entering made sure to wish me a good evening.  My initial impression of the man was that he was surly and testy but that's just how he comes off.\n\nThe food was very good.  The Mongolian sauce was mixture of sweet with spice and the chicken and vegetables all tasted fresh.","My husband and I went there Saturday, the service was great!  Our friends were going to be late so they told us to start.  And start we did!\nThey were serving Dim Sum, something we had never tried, so glad we did, it was wonderful, hubby wouldn't do the chicken feet, but I think next time I will, it looked very good.\nOur friends showed up and ordered their food, and ate all of it, they said that usually they take food home, but it was so good they had to eat all of it!\nWe will be going back very soon!","Let's see, over 50... check \nold white man...........check \neats dinner ...............check \nlistens to the piano  check \n\nwow this must be the place for me, I mean after all it is in a Chinese mall, no make that a Chinese Cultural Center. How could I possibly have discerning taste with such trickery to get me here to eat. \nDude if you are going to rate a restaurant no need to degrade others with your arrogance. \nFool is my review of wanugee N. \n\nNow on the restaurant. The last time we were here the food was not good, the piano was too loud and the waitress had a real attitude. IT won't keep me from going back as I have had good meals and wait service too. \n\nBack to wanugee N. I do not expect any place in Phx. to have authentic Chinese food, by that I mean the street food one finds in China. \nBut I do expect what I fork in to my mouth is worth what I am going to fork over in cost. Even an old white guy like me can tell the difference between good and bad food. No matter what it is called.","Okay so Ive been glum the past few days as I have an impending birthday. Every year this time I get all down in the dumps.. not that I'm not happy with my life cause life is good. Its more like getting further away from my youth and closer to being well, old. All of my grandparents were crotchety, sourpuss drama queens.. is that my fate? Can I break the mold or am I to going to be a crotchety sourpuss?\n\nSo as I contemplate and figure out what I'm going to do with my birthday baggage I decide to squash it with food. All weekend Ive been eating out and having a good time. This is one of the few times outside of a vacation where I will live it completely and to the near of sheer gluttony. So why not dim sum? \n\nIve chowed much dim sum in my 36 years of earthen wear.. of course some good and some bad. I have never been to a place where every dish was great.. Golden Buddha is no exception to this.. they do the basics well enough and have enough funky cool Asian style to keep me interested in returning. The carts around 1130 flow well but around noon it' s full blown freeway action! In fact there might be some road kill in there based on some of the looks on that last steam cart.. \n\nMe and 3 others who were feeling my pain ordered 14, count them, 14 different dishes. One of my friends is from Georgia and had never had dim sum but he is so courageous and unflinching that he was just a blast. Just the shot in the arm to get me out of my funk. I remember the first time I had dim sum.. my eyes wide open, nostrils flared and excited to see what was under the next steamer lid. That was him today.. one exciting thing after the next.. he was even willing to try chicken feet but this is one of those dishes not done very well here. \n\nMy friend took me back to a time where I was younger and less experienced. He looked up to me to guide him through the noodles, bao and sui mai.. like a big brother.. I'm privileged that I could show him something new and exciting and he was so into it! So instead of feeling sorry for myself I felt experienced and useful.. that there is something I can give back to others.. that its not all about me and me aging but about what can be shared with others.\n\nThere is so much more to do, give and feel in this short time we are here.. and Ill do it to, one bite at a time.","The best to be found in land locked Arizona.  My favorite sticky rice is here.  They have dim sum every day, but not a huge selection, though you can order off the menu.  I think it is much bigger on the weekends.  I'm just happy I can get my fix 7 days a week.  Beautiful gardens to walk through, with fish ponds, and a 99 market next door!","I ate at Golden Buddha a few weeks ago.  We ate at the restaurant after a day at the zoo with our 4 year old and had a blast.  The piano bar played tunes for my daughter and the staff was more than accommodating.  The general tso chicken was better than anything I can get in Tucson.  The soup was chocked full of fresh, read FRESH, not canned, vegetables.  All in all, I was very satisfied with the meal and the service.  Plus the decor is very nice, clean and cheery. \n\nEat at Golden Buddha.","For those who gave this place low marks, forgive me. I really like this place. Now I haven't tried various dim sum places so I'm reserving the right to downgrade the place as needed. The variety of food is plentiful, and the carts just keep on coming. I love the steamed pork buns, and the shiu mai (not sure if I spelled that correctly). Yesterday, my favorite pick was the deep fried rolls of taro and shrimp. YUM! I have never ordered from their menu so I can only talk about their dim sum. My friends and I try to go eat dim sum almost every Sunday. It's a cheap way to try new foods, and if you don't like it, well.. you can get away with pushing it aside with minimal guilt. Give it a try! You might be surprised.","I like Golden Buddha, have taken many friends there for Dim Sum.  \nTry not to \"hit\" the dumpling cart to heavy; otherwise cannot finish it to the dessert cart (LOL).\nLove the jasmine tea and the staff willing to help you if you do not understand the what each item is.\nSingapore Rice Noodles a favorite, along with any of the shrimp dumplings; also the broccoli and green beans.\nOnly wish that the carts with eggplant stuffed with shrimp or green peppers with shrimp were not on \"heated\" carts; by the time it gets to you the food is cold.\nOnly concern is that went on 22MAY2010 at 1:30PM; there was a closed sign due to electricity???\nREVISED: 26MAY2010 - called this evening - looks like they are back open again.","I've been to the Golden Buddha on several occasions and it is my favorite, by far, for honest Chinese food. \nWhile I've sampled everything from their vegetarian to their beef, I love their mandarin chicken. More recently, I was delighted to relive the wonders of their Kung Pao Chicken and Beef with Broccoli. \nI absolutely love the egg drop soup and mini crab rangoons that come with the meal.","The very first time I went to Golden Buddha was with my BFF and it was our first dim sum experience. Little did I know this would forever change my life and eating experiences. Although I must admit that first time was a bit awkward.\n\nGB wisely takes reservations which was wonderful (even though it wasn't crazy busy). Our assorted dim sum plates were flavorful and fresh. And the carts seemed to be in constant rotation so we were never too far from a good selection.\n\nWhat really helps GB is its location. The Cofco Center is an experience in itself, where one can have herbs specially blended, select a fresh member of marine life to take home and cook or browse through a store with one of the largest selections of Buddhas and hand fans I've experienced outside of San Francisco.","I've been to Golden Buddha a few times and have not been disappointed. \n\nThey have a LARGE selection of Dim Sum and if you're not careful you can get carried away.\n\nTry and get there early and you'll get the best and most fresh selection.\nMake sure you walk around the garden when you're done.","Probably the most comprehensive Chinese menu in the Valley.  Pick from well over 100 dishes, but if you want the best order the Peking Duck.  Everything else is very good, but without a wow factor.  You'll see lots of Chinese people in this massive restaurant, which probably means they're doing a fine job in the kitchen.","I very much enjoyed eating here. Food was great. Fairly fast service. Wasn't expensive either for the 4 of us.","Golden Buddha has GREAT dim sum.  Their prices are reasonable and the staff is very polite wheeling their little carts.  I tend to go on the weekend because there is more selection but they do dim sum throughout the week.  They also have some very authentic dishes on the menu for those who are more of the adventurous types.  Be sure to say hello to the turtles the next time you go.","This place in the Chinese Cultural Center has a very pretty and elegant bar area. I was pleased to learn that they had some very reasonable and delicious happy hour snacks. This is a good place for a Pina Colada. I had one by myself along with some dumplings and fried shrimp appetizer. Sadly I never brought anyone else here with me. It was happy hour heaven but you know? A lot of my friends in AZ pretty much hang out in one neighborhood or another and nobody I know really lives close to the Buddha.\nThe airport is pretty close by. This might be a good pre-flight send-off location.","I have had dim sum in New Orleans and Phoenix (not SF), and this is about equal to the best of New Orleans as far as flavor.\nAs for ambiance, today was a good day. I've had dim sum here about a dozen times, and have had very good service and quality 90% of the time, including weekends. I have had bad days here, but since today was good, I'll rate accordingly. It's closer to a 4.5, but since I can't give half-stars, I rounded up.\nDon't expect me to give these the right names, but... I was less than impressed with the bbq pork balls. They tasted too much like honey and the beef was minimal. The bbq sauce tasted bottled. Outside of that, their herbal hot tea is delicious even on a hot day.\nThe shu mai were very good, and the shrimp in a spinach dumpling was fantastic. A definite don't miss is their sticky rice in lotus leaf. It's among the best I've had anywhere. Just be careful; you'll find bones in it every once in a while. Go for any of their steamed dumplings; they're very flavorful. As others have said, I love the Chinese broccoli, but you'll only find it on the carts on weekends. Otherwise order it off the menu.\nToday (11:30 lunch) the carts came around often, and everything except the pork buns was piping hot and fresh. By the way, despite the price increases, even the sticky rice was considered a medium size entree, and the two of us eating there escaped with a bill under $20 and we were done in under 30 minutes.\nI strongly recommend the dim sum here, whether you've had it a million times or have never had it before. You usually won't be disappointed.","I don't really understand the poor reviews on this place.....maybe it depends on the day you go? We went on a Sunday, it was crazy busy, but service was great! (of course, my view of customer service is a little different then the rest... I used to live on an island where you were just happy to find what you were looking for, let alone expect good customer service) Anyways, our server was very sweet! Always had a smile on her face. The carts served us promplty and none of the food was cold. They always had whatever we wanted (I hate having to wait for the next cart).\n\nNow, as for the actual dim sum and food.......holy cow, to die for! So flavorful and fresh!! The broccoli makes you sing...and the wine noodles, make you cry. You leave with very weird mixed emotions, but mostly a happy belly full of yummy food.\n\nIn my opinion, this is the best dim sum I have been able to find in Phx. I'm ditching my previous spot (Mekong Palace) and will be back to Golden Buddha when the dim sum monster strikes again!"],"type":["Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low

waiter was to be found about ten minutes later they gave us our water and left again! It wasn't even busy! There were only TWO dim sum carts floating around somewhere. Then our waiter finally came around and took our orders of lunch entrees. The food was not even that good as the reviews that are posted on here. When we came up to pay, the bill was super overpriced. I will not be returning here, I am better off eating at Great Wall Cuisine.","If this place had zero stars I would have given them that ! Let me start off by saying I was so excited to read all great reviews so maybe I just came in on a off day? We walked in and were seated came over and asked if we wanted water or tea I guess they don't serve anything Else, Then we placed an order pork dumplings and sticky rice nasty! Then I asked if they served egg rolls they said they were out!!! they pushed their little carts around with hot plates that basically steam the food and is not fresh and what you get is soggy poor customer service we had to get up and look for someone to give us our tab so we could get the heck out of there are get some real food. It looked like it would be a great place for groups of people would not recommend if you are on mission for what you want and want to place an order but it could be a fun experience for some people.","You walk into a Chinese restaurant on a Saturday afternoon for dim sum and you expect the place to be PACKED.  Well, walking in to a pretty much empty dining room, it's a VERY CLEAR SIGN.  But my friend insisted and I was very hesitant for good reasons.  Another indicator, the majority of the patrons were NON Asian.  \n\nFood: You walk in and you see carts of the food by the entrance to the dining room.  Umm, I thought dim sum should come right off the steamer and into the carts and they roll it around, not sitting around.  The dim sum was garbage.  It had the typical selection, but at minimum.  \n\nService: It's ok.  But it doesn't make up for the horrible food.\n\nBottom line: NO WAY!  Stay away!","I've been here many times...Mother's Day with family, dim sum with book club, etc. But I will not go back again.  I stopped in to ask the owner about a donation or reduced price for a class of under-privileged kids that I volunteer with.  His reaction was to scoff and shoo me out the door while handing me his card and saying I could email him.  He turned his back and headed off to the messy newspaper-strewn table he haunts between guests arrivals.  Maybe he's a community-minded business owner, but then again, maybe he's not.  I'll be dining elsewhere.","Being from Chicago, we are used to getting authentic Chinese food all the time.  But when we first starting spending a lot of time in Scottsdale/Phoenix, we found it a challenge to get authentic Chinese food.  We were excited to find the Golden Buddha and have made many trips over the years all the way from the Troon North area to get our fix.  However, service has declined to the point where it is no longer worth the aggravation.  We went there last night for Chinese New Year and will never go back.  Granted they were very busy because of a lot of large tables there, but waiting almost an hour to get our food is not acceptable under any circumstance!  45 mins. into our wait, the waitress came back (after we flagged her down to ask about our food) and said one of the dishes we ordered was not available....after 45 mins.!!!! What makes the whole experience an unforgivable one is that the manager/owner is so indifferent and never apologized or offered a discount off the bill...nothing.  When we left, the same manager was at the piano singing in Chinese. Huh?  Other than Nee House in Scottsdale, the search goes on for a restaurant that serves authentic Chinese food closer to home.","I will NEVER go there again.  I reserved a table for a group of 16 people for 5:00 PM on Christmas Eve .  The person on the phone ( I believe the manager) repeatedly asked me to call ahead and give him an accurate head count since he said they'd be swamped that day.  I followed up with him twice.  \nWhen the first couple of us arrived, we had menus shoved in our faces immediately and told we \"Must order now.  Must order now\" because they were going to be busy later on.  The place was practically empty.  As each person arrived, they were treated the same way. \nWe rushed and placed our orders and then they brought out our checks WAY before we saw any sign of our food.  I have never in my life been treated so rudely by a restaurant.\nIt was utter chaos when the food started coming out while everyone struggled to get the correct dish they ordered.  One person didn't get her food until we were all just about finished eating. \nOne top of all that, the food wasn't even good.  I've had better Kung Pao Chicken at Panda Express!\nAfter being rushed through our meal, the place wasn't even half full by the time we left.  I thought being at the Cultural Center, this restaurant would be a sure thing but boy was I wrong.  Lovely way to spend Christmas Eve..","If you are looking a chinese restaurant to host a big party look some other than the Golden Buddah.  I recently attended a banquet at the Golden Buddah and I was shocked at the level of quality of food and service.  Of the 10 dishes served 4 were nearly inedible.  \n\nThere was a crab claw appetizer, most chinese restaurants prepare this dish by taking a crab claw surrounding it with ground shrimp, batter and then deep fry.  At Golden Buddah, the crab claw served was mostly batter.  \n\nThe shark fin soup served was mostly broth.  Shark fin is an expensive ingredient and most places usually use imitation shark fin, but come on at least put something in there so that I know I'm eating soup and not dirty sink water.  \n\nGinger scallion lobster is battered, fried, and then stir fried in a sauce with ginger and scallions.  The ginger scallion lobster served was over-cooked and dried out.  \n\nLastly, there was a steamed fish.  The fish was raw in the middle.   \n\nIt wasn't all bad, there was a crispy chicken with garlic dish that was pretty good, but out of 10 dishes 4 were bad, 5 were okay, and 1 was good.  \n\nDoes 4 bad dishes out of 10 warrant a one star rating?  Well it does when you factor in the service.  The soup, appetizer, and first entree arrived timely, but after that there was a 1 hour gap before we received the next dish.  The dishes were not served with accompanying white rice which I thought was odd.  We had to ask for it, and even the rice took a while to arrive.","I agree with Crystal C., that the dim sum isn't the greatest I've ever had. In fact, I am not sure if the meal was so tasty that it was memorable. I do remember the \"calamari\" was not really calamari, like you would think. It was presented more like a sweet and sour pork (so calamari with LOTS of breading) without any sauce. As a result, the dish was dry and salty.\n\nThe sticky rice was good (hard to mess up), the chicken feet were okay (needed more five spice powder), and the shumai was alright. The noodles were good, and I can see why the cart ran out after the first round. The diners were an equal mix of Asians and Americans. I would've preferred to see more Asians eating (as I am used to in a Chinatown and gives an indication of authenticity), but I do realize we're in Phoenix where the Asian population is not like San Francisco or Houston. \n\nThe meal came to about $30 for two, including jasmine tea. The carts are loud because they are made out of metal and roll on tile. I am also not used to staff members shouting what they have in their cart, like a newspaper boy yelling \"Extra! Extra!\" Christmas music was playing after mid-January, so the atmosphere felt strange. Next time I visit the city, I probably will pass.","Can't say that I was very impressed. Came for dinner in a hopeful and enthusiastic mood since the reviews have been pretty good, but I don't think this place lives up to its current good, but declining rating.\n\nOrdered the Combo fried rice (shrimp, chicken, beef, pork), sesame chicken, and garlic fried chicken. \n\nThe combo fried rice was pretty good, but ended up drinking about 6 glasses of water due to the MSG and sodium content. You'd think that the cook spent his better years in the French Foreign Legion in the Sahara eating salt tablets and developed a taste for them. \n\nThe sesame chicken had a good flavor and a thick brown sweet sauce. I liked it a lot until it got cool and the sauce looked (with that stringy consistency) more like glue. You think I'm kidding? I'm not.\n\nGarlic fried chicken was bad. Just bad. It was like an over roasted dried out half chicken with some dried garlic pieces sprinkled on top. No spices, no flavor, no good. \n\nWe then got all kinds of lip from the waitress when we asked if they could change the channel on the TV from college football, to the Suns game. They made it into this big deal that the \"customers\" wanted to see the football game. Yeah right, it was University of West Virginia Vs. University of Connecticut! I would have believed it if it was a local team....\n\nIt's better than a 1 star joint, but only because it's borderline edible. To be avoided.","This restaurant is located in the Chinese Cultural Center and was the one restaurant that I had not been to. So after some shopping at one of the shops, we stepped in to have dinner.\n\nWe stepped in and asked for a seat for two. We were seated immediately. The place was decorated nicely and a lady playing the piano made for great ambiance.\n\nWe looked at the menu briefly and ordered our drinks, an appetizer, a soup and two main dishes. The drinks came out promptly and so did the rest of the meal. My goodness everything we ordered was very tasty.\n\nThe waiter service itself however was not even close to the decor and food. He never introduced himself, and although he took our order, our food itself was brought out by a kitchen person.\n\nAfter we ordered our waiter really never came back asking if we needed anything else, except to give us our check at the end and that was after the person I was dining with got up and asked a different waiter for it.\n\nIt's amazing how a place with great food, decor, and ambiance can mess it all up by crappy waiter service.","I love Dim Sum, my favorite Chinese dish.\n\nWhen Golden Buddha first open, they have excellent Dim sum. I went there many times, I tell my friend how good it is, But now,  they change cook, taste more like  week old left over. Rumor has it, they change cook every few month, so Quality of cooking change. (not sure if that is true, but that is what I was told.)\nMy advice is; when you walk in the door and the place is pack, = Good Cook. if the place is bare = bad cook. leave immediately. don't waste your money.","If you just \"want\" dim sum, go here. If you are \"craving\" dim sum, go elsewhere (take a 5 hour drive west to neighboring state, California).\n\nAnyway, I've been visiting Golden Buddha in the noontime for roughly 2 years now. I believe they moved from their original site (7th St. & Osborn), formerly \"China Doll.\" Relocation brought along better atmosphere and smiling faces. This does not mean, better dim sum. But since we are in Phoenix, I will settle for what they have to offer. \n\nBe mindful of the dim sum tab. It's itemized high-medium-low. \n\nShaomai can be found as combinations of pork/mushroom, shrimp, or shark fin (which should not be confused as true shark bits, as the shaomai is prepared to look like a shark's fin). These picks are okay...perhaps on a better day shao mai will be served in less-rigid, or fresher wrappers. Potstickers are okay as well, just the usual scallion and pork, and dry wrapper. The baby pork ribs in light black bean sauce and jalapenos is alright, but sometimes lacks in taste. Tripe is also served in its bare minimum...so if you enjoy the texture and flavor of tripe, try this with its clear sauce and thinly sliced carrots and celery.  \nBuche (that's what I call it), or fried sesame balls are also available, although if you wait until dessert, they will also be a bit stiff. There are a few other things that may be \"spotted\" but are not worth mentioning. \n\nDon't order from their lunch menu, as you can find these over-salted dishes at Panda Express anyway. \n\nOverall, dim sum at Golden Buddha is a place to go if you are around the vicinity and feel like having something apart from the usual fast food. However, discriminating palates- beware.","Not impressed with this place at all. This was not the friendliest place around, maybe because of the language barrier (most or all were clearly native Chinese speakers), or maybe just the attitude of the employees.\n\nI ordered the sweet and sour chicken lunch, which came with the typical egg drop soup, crab rangoon, and egg roll. The soup was ok - maybe it's just me, but I prefer a real spoon to the scoop that they gave me. The egg roll was tiny and not that great, and the crab rangoon was ok, but maybe a little undercooked. The chicken wasn't bad, but nothing special, as was the rice and other stuff on the plate.\n\nOverall, this was just not my kind of Chinese place.","Disappointing.  Mediocre at best.  I am staying at the Aloft hotel in phoenix and ordered some delivery. I ordered a couple american chinese food staples: general tso's chicken, dumplings and hot&sour soup.  Soup had zero flavor, dumplings tasted freezer burned and processed.  General tso chicken was ehh. \n\nA lot of good reviews on here so it must be for eat in and for their dim sum.  Don't order delivery, you will be left hungry and unsatisfied.","Went there on Saturday for early lunch.  My wife did the dim sum, it was okay, we were both disgusted by the sugar cane shrimp; but the rest was good.  \n\nI ordered the chicken szechwuan, the waitress warned me it was \"spicy\" the reason I ordered it.  It came out delicious, but not what I would call spicy.  Overall its hard to find good Chinese in the valley and I would call this good without hesitation.","So I was referred to this place from the front desk of my hotel. I'm from SF so I'm coming from a place with really good chinese food. \n\nThe dim sum is just \"ok\" nothing for me to write home about. The one dish that I really liked was the chinese broccoli cooked with garlic sauce. Yum yum yum.  It's in a big bowl, not oily, not saucy, just really good. I think it's $7.50.  \n\nIt's a somewhat pricey and just like all chinese restaurants, it's not the cleanest.  The chair was filthy.  the dishes weren't all that great.  I wouldn't go back unless I want the chinese broccoli.  \n\nSo I went on a Sunday and it was not crowded at all. There's not a huge asian population  in Phoenix (not that I could tell) so I don't think there's a high demand for dim sum.  And also, I sooooooo felt like taking a pic of this, but a Mexican lady was pushing one of the dim sum carts. That is unheard of in SF.  This is a mainly mandarin restaurant and the dim sum places I go are usually cantonese.  Not a big deal though since the dishes look the same. \n\nDude, there was a turtle in the fish tank that I saw as I left.  I hope they don't eat that!","A Premier Chinese Atmosphere,\nThe Chinese cultural center and Asian Garden produces an Asain atmosphere that can be recognized from the 202.  \n With Dim Sum served this location earns its respect from the local community.\n\nDim Sum tip,  You have to be smart with the Dim Sum ladies they look nice innocent but they are professional sales people that will sell you more dishes than you need before you know what to do.  \n\nI love the desserts here ask the server to see the dessert tray.","This restaurant has a bit of an identity crisis. It is in the Chinese cultural center, but serves Japanese beer (Kirin on tap!) and the live piano music is American pop. We had to ask for chopsticks.\n\nHaving said that, the service was professional. Our waiter held a hot appetizer for one of our party who was away from the table so that it would not be cold when he returned. We were asked frequently--and not too frequently--if things were ok both by our waiter and the manager/proprietor.\n\nThe food was ok-to-good. Fried shrimp egg rolls were dainty but yummy. Duck was tasty but very chewy. Kung-pao chicken was pleasantly spiced. Plenty of rice. A pitcher of ice water with lemon was left at the table. \n\nAtmosphere was also pleasant. Chairs comfortable, tables spaced well, restrooms large and clean...and there is indeed a large golden Buddha by the entrance.","I took a group of friends here and relatives other times. The place is consistently good for Dim-sum during lunch. It is typical Chinese and nothing fancy.\n\nWhat helps this place is the moat scenery.  3 stars for visiting here based on convenience since there are similar places in town.","Having grown up in Hong Kong and having eaten dim sum in London, NY, LA, SF and Vancouver (actually Richmond), I can confidently say I know my dim sum.\n\nGood selection of well-executed dim sum when the carts actually come around and there's anything left in it.  I'd give it 4 stars for food but the wait definitely detracted from the whole experience.\n\nI think the problem with Golden Buddha is that they can't handle the heavy flow on weekends.  There's not enough regular dim sum eaters like LA that can sustain a steady flow of diners throughout the week, forcing restaurants like Golden Buddha to depend heavily on extra part-time help on weekends.  \n\nDim sum takes serious skill so the chef still ends up doing most of the work.  When we looked into the kitchen, we saw a Chinese woman doing most of the cooking herself.  No wonder it took forever for a cart to come out and when it does, it's swarmed on by a pack of vultures.\n\nIf you're willing to eat at a more simply decorated place with a smaller menu, I'd highly recommend China Chan.  It's much more relaxed - usually no wait on weekends.  An experienced chef makes all the dim sum himself so the menu's much shorter but all the classics are on it.  Anything steamed is made to order so is very fresh.","Situated in the Chinese Cultural Center near the SkyHarbor Airport, this was another pleasant find. All I had was the Dim Sum menu, and I would say this is the best you're gonna get in Phoenix. Still worth the stop to get your Dim Sum fix. The cart ladies were pleasant and very happy to converse with me in Cantonese. Only downside was the chicken sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaves, naw mei gai, was way overcooked, and mushy.","Do you want to eat Chinese Food in an elegant environment on a Friday night in Phoenix? \n\nBe entertained by classic, quiet standards being played live on a piano while you dine?\n\nAre you 50 years old and Caucasian?\n\nThen the Golden Buddha is the place for you! \n\nIts in the Chinese Cultural Center Mall on 44th, and a popular weekend spot for Dim Sum. For a DIm Sum starved Valley of the Sun, Golden Buddha's is decent. \n\nFor dinner, though, it is awfully Americanized and not very authentic Chinese. But with a bunch of American customers coming for dinner, what do you expect? They probably think they are getting \"real Chinese\" food by going to the Chinese Mall, but then again, they are used to PF Chang's or Stix normally in their neighborhood, so this is a step up.\n\nThe best thing about this place is the decor, which is clean and nice, with a Hong Kong Junk boat design covering the ceiling from the bar into the dining room. The next best thing is the Piano interludes on weekend nights. The service is next, which is a little overly eager to remove your plate, and the last thing is the food. \n\nThey do give decent portions. I ordered Guo Teh (potstickers) and got 6 fat ones. But they weren't served with the usual soy, chili oil and vinegar, but a soy and green onions mixture. The Mapo Tofu was ok, as they used a nice silky tofu, which was nice, but no green onions, and sliced black mushrooms instead, which I like, but not in this dish.\n\nCome here for the ambiance and music in the evenings, or on the weekend days for Dim Sum.","Decent dim sum, especially to be found in the middle of the desert. Sadly, the best food I've had in Phoenix.","This place is a little difficult for me to review.  I was staying at the Hampton Inn across the street and this is the closest restaurant so off I went.\n\nI walked in and the owner or manager met me at the door and asked \"how many\"?\n\nI told him I wanted to order take out and handed me a menu and pointed to the waiting area which was covered in newspapers.  I chose to go to the bar, order a glass of wine, and peruse the menu.\n\nThe drinks are expensive but I didn't think the food was.  Less than $10 for my Mongolian Chicken which came with white sticky rice and a fortune cookie.  When ordering I asked if I could have fried rice instead of white rice but was told \"no\".  Most places allow this for a nominal fee.\n\nFine by me.  Give the white rice.  Food was prepared and their to-go boxes were a lot better than the standard white Chinese \"to go\" boxes.  They also included the plastic-ware, napkin, and soy sauce, which a lot of places forget.\n\nLooking around I found a whole lot of goodness along with a couple disappointments.  Most notably the newspaper strewn about and behind the bar, to the right were a lot of boxes stacked in an unsightly fashion.  I could have been a little more presentable in my opinion.\n\nI peeked into the dining room because I wanted to see if the piano music was piped in or live.  It was live which was very nice. Also, the dinning room looked very nice and cozy.\n\nAs I was leaving the same man who greeted me upon entering made sure to wish me a good evening.  My initial impression of the man was that he was surly and testy but that's just how he comes off.\n\nThe food was very good.  The Mongolian sauce was mixture of sweet with spice and the chicken and vegetables all tasted fresh.","My husband and I went there Saturday, the service was great!  Our friends were going to be late so they told us to start.  And start we did!\nThey were serving Dim Sum, something we had never tried, so glad we did, it was wonderful, hubby wouldn't do the chicken feet, but I think next time I will, it looked very good.\nOur friends showed up and ordered their food, and ate all of it, they said that usually they take food home, but it was so good they had to eat all of it!\nWe will be going back very soon!","Let's see, over 50... check \nold white man...........check \neats dinner ...............check \nlistens to the piano  check \n\nwow this must be the place for me, I mean after all it is in a Chinese mall, no make that a Chinese Cultural Center. How could I possibly have discerning taste with such trickery to get me here to eat. \nDude if you are going to rate a restaurant no need to degrade others with your arrogance. \nFool is my review of wanugee N. \n\nNow on the restaurant. The last time we were here the food was not good, the piano was too loud and the waitress had a real attitude. IT won't keep me from going back as I have had good meals and wait service too. \n\nBack to wanugee N. I do not expect any place in Phx. to have authentic Chinese food, by that I mean the street food one finds in China. \nBut I do expect what I fork in to my mouth is worth what I am going to fork over in cost. Even an old white guy like me can tell the difference between good and bad food. No matter what it is called.","Okay so Ive been glum the past few days as I have an impending birthday. Every year this time I get all down in the dumps.. not that I'm not happy with my life cause life is good. Its more like getting further away from my youth and closer to being well, old. All of my grandparents were crotchety, sourpuss drama queens.. is that my fate? Can I break the mold or am I to going to be a crotchety sourpuss?\n\nSo as I contemplate and figure out what I'm going to do with my birthday baggage I decide to squash it with food. All weekend Ive been eating out and having a good time. This is one of the few times outside of a vacation where I will live it completely and to the near of sheer gluttony. So why not dim sum? \n\nIve chowed much dim sum in my 36 years of earthen wear.. of course some good and some bad. I have never been to a place where every dish was great.. Golden Buddha is no exception to this.. they do the basics well enough and have enough funky cool Asian style to keep me interested in returning. The carts around 1130 flow well but around noon it' s full blown freeway action! In fact there might be some road kill in there based on some of the looks on that last steam cart.. \n\nMe and 3 others who were feeling my pain ordered 14, count them, 14 different dishes. One of my friends is from Georgia and had never had dim sum but he is so courageous and unflinching that he was just a blast. Just the shot in the arm to get me out of my funk. I remember the first time I had dim sum.. my eyes wide open, nostrils flared and excited to see what was under the next steamer lid. That was him today.. one exciting thing after the next.. he was even willing to try chicken feet but this is one of those dishes not done very well here. \n\nMy friend took me back to a time where I was younger and less experienced. He looked up to me to guide him through the noodles, bao and sui mai.. like a big brother.. I'm privileged that I could show him something new and exciting and he was so into it! So instead of feeling sorry for myself I felt experienced and useful.. that there is something I can give back to others.. that its not all about me and me aging but about what can be shared with others.\n\nThere is so much more to do, give and feel in this short time we are here.. and Ill do it to, one bite at a time.","The best to be found in land locked Arizona.  My favorite sticky rice is here.  They have dim sum every day, but not a huge selection, though you can order off the menu.  I think it is much bigger on the weekends.  I'm just happy I can get my fix 7 days a week.  Beautiful gardens to walk through, with fish ponds, and a 99 market next door!","I ate at Golden Buddha a few weeks ago.  We ate at the restaurant after a day at the zoo with our 4 year old and had a blast.  The piano bar played tunes for my daughter and the staff was more than accommodating.  The general tso chicken was better than anything I can get in Tucson.  The soup was chocked full of fresh, read FRESH, not canned, vegetables.  All in all, I was very satisfied with the meal and the service.  Plus the decor is very nice, clean and cheery. \n\nEat at Golden Buddha.","For those who gave this place low marks, forgive me. I really like this place. Now I haven't tried various dim sum places so I'm reserving the right to downgrade the place as needed. The variety of food is plentiful, and the carts just keep on coming. I love the steamed pork buns, and the shiu mai (not sure if I spelled that correctly). Yesterday, my favorite pick was the deep fried rolls of taro and shrimp. YUM! I have never ordered from their menu so I can only talk about their dim sum. My friends and I try to go eat dim sum almost every Sunday. It's a cheap way to try new foods, and if you don't like it, well.. you can get away with pushing it aside with minimal guilt. Give it a try! You might be surprised.","I like Golden Buddha, have taken many friends there for Dim Sum.  \nTry not to \"hit\" the dumpling cart to heavy; otherwise cannot finish it to the dessert cart (LOL).\nLove the jasmine tea and the staff willing to help you if you do not understand the what each item is.\nSingapore Rice Noodles a favorite, along with any of the shrimp dumplings; also the broccoli and green beans.\nOnly wish that the carts with eggplant stuffed with shrimp or green peppers with shrimp were not on \"heated\" carts; by the time it gets to you the food is cold.\nOnly concern is that went on 22MAY2010 at 1:30PM; there was a closed sign due to electricity???\nREVISED: 26MAY2010 - called this evening - looks like they are back open again.","I've been to the Golden Buddha on several occasions and it is my favorite, by far, for honest Chinese food. \nWhile I've sampled everything from their vegetarian to their beef, I love their mandarin chicken. More recently, I was delighted to relive the wonders of their Kung Pao Chicken and Beef with Broccoli. \nI absolutely love the egg drop soup and mini crab rangoons that come with the meal.","The very first time I went to Golden Buddha was with my BFF and it was our first dim sum experience. Little did I know this would forever change my life and eating experiences. Although I must admit that first time was a bit awkward.\n\nGB wisely takes reservations which was wonderful (even though it wasn't crazy busy). Our assorted dim sum plates were flavorful and fresh. And the carts seemed to be in constant rotation so we were never too far from a good selection.\n\nWhat really helps GB is its location. The Cofco Center is an experience in itself, where one can have herbs specially blended, select a fresh member of marine life to take home and cook or browse through a store with one of the largest selections of Buddhas and hand fans I've experienced outside of San Francisco.","I've been to Golden Buddha a few times and have not been disappointed. \n\nThey have a LARGE selection of Dim Sum and if you're not careful you can get carried away.\n\nTry and get there early and you'll get the best and most fresh selection.\nMake sure you walk around the garden when you're done.","Probably the most comprehensive Chinese menu in the Valley.  Pick from well over 100 dishes, but if you want the best order the Peking Duck.  Everything else is very good, but without a wow factor.  You'll see lots of Chinese people in this massive restaurant, which probably means they're doing a fine job in the kitchen.","I very much enjoyed eating here. Food was great. Fairly fast service. Wasn't expensive either for the 4 of us.","Golden Buddha has GREAT dim sum.  Their prices are reasonable and the staff is very polite wheeling their little carts.  I tend to go on the weekend because there is more selection but they do dim sum throughout the week.  They also have some very authentic dishes on the menu for those who are more of the adventurous types.  Be sure to say hello to the turtles the next time you go.","This place in the Chinese Cultural Center has a very pretty and elegant bar area. I was pleased to learn that they had some very reasonable and delicious happy hour snacks. This is a good place for a Pina Colada. I had one by myself along with some dumplings and fried shrimp appetizer. Sadly I never brought anyone else here with me. It was happy hour heaven but you know? A lot of my friends in AZ pretty much hang out in one neighborhood or another and nobody I know really lives close to the Buddha.\nThe airport is pretty close by. This might be a good pre-flight send-off location.","I have had dim sum in New Orleans and Phoenix (not SF), and this is about equal to the best of New Orleans as far as flavor.\nAs for ambiance, today was a good day. I've had dim sum here about a dozen times, and have had very good service and quality 90% of the time, including weekends. I have had bad days here, but since today was good, I'll rate accordingly. It's closer to a 4.5, but since I can't give half-stars, I rounded up.\nDon't expect me to give these the right names, but... I was less than impressed with the bbq pork balls. They tasted too much like honey and the beef was minimal. The bbq sauce tasted bottled. Outside of that, their herbal hot tea is delicious even on a hot day.\nThe shu mai were very good, and the shrimp in a spinach dumpling was fantastic. A definite don't miss is their sticky rice in lotus leaf. It's among the best I've had anywhere. Just be careful; you'll find bones in it every once in a while. Go for any of their steamed dumplings; they're very flavorful. As others have said, I love the Chinese broccoli, but you'll only find it on the carts on weekends. Otherwise order it off the menu.\nToday (11:30 lunch) the carts came around often, and everything except the pork buns was piping hot and fresh. By the way, despite the price increases, even the sticky rice was considered a medium size entree, and the two of us eating there escaped with a bill under $20 and we were done in under 30 minutes.\nI strongly recommend the dim sum here, whether you've had it a million times or have never had it before. You usually won't be disappointed.","I don't really understand the poor reviews on this place.....maybe it depends on the day you go? We went on a Sunday, it was crazy busy, but service was great! (of course, my view of customer service is a little different then the rest... I used to live on an island where you were just happy to find what you were looking for, let alone expect good customer service) Anyways, our server was very sweet! Always had a smile on her face. The carts served us promplty and none of the food was cold. They always had whatever we wanted (I hate having to wait for the next cart).\n\nNow, as for the actual dim sum and food.......holy cow, to die for! So flavorful and fresh!! The broccoli makes you sing...and the wine noodles, make you cry. You leave with very weird mixed emotions, but mostly a happy belly full of yummy food.\n\nIn my opinion, this is the best dim sum I have been able to find in Phx. I'm ditching my previous spot (Mekong Palace) and will be back to Golden Buddha when the dim sum monster strikes again!"],"type":["Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low

hotel and not really having eaten much all day, I was hungry.\n\nThe service was terrible....no one knew what they were doing so it took 10 minutes to get a freaking slice of pizza and then when said pizza came it was NASTY.\n\nMy husband once got a pizza in Milwaukee where they put Kraft singles on it as cheese and Pizza Parma is just behind that for worst pizza ever.","Looking for a quick bite to eat and a local told me this was \"the best pizza in the city.\"  I got a plain slice and a pepperoni slice. Possibly the worst pizza I have ever eaten.  This wouldn't even qualify as pizza in North Jersey.  I ate half of the plain slice because I was starving....then threw both in the garbage.  \n\nIf this is really the best pizza in Pittsburgh... wow.","I ordered from Pizza Parma out of storm necessity. I ordered a chicken parmigiana \"hoagie\", which was dry and luke warm. The potato bacon soup was like something out of a can, except the chunks of potato were hard and undercooked..all pretty nasty and overly salty.\n\nNever order from them.","Zero stars. Came in 10 mins before close. Female manager on duty asked for $100 in exchange for a pizza. When we refused she said she could not serve us because her employees had been working since 9am..,it is currently 2:00 am... Sounds pretty illegal to me","Average pizza. But with ten guys working - and not much business at the moment - it still took twenty minutes to get a slice of pepperoni. I'll walk across the street next time.","My butthole hasn't been right for days, nor my stomach. \n\nWe ordered in because we all had a long day and were set to have a family movie night.\n\nA pizza and hoagie. \n\nThe hoagie wasn't anything to run and go scream from the rooftops about but the pizza was covered in little ass ruining intestinal demons and this I am nearly sure of.\n\nI had to be talked out of sending pizza Parma a bill for several rolls of toilet paper.\n\nBe weary of the pizza, distrustful actually.\n\nYour butthole will thank me for it!","Hubby and I dropped in after a hellish morning at the Social Security office. Hubby loves pizza so we made a stop.\n\nPizza wan't bad, it was actually pretty decent. But the place was disgusting and the cashier was incredibly rude.","I eat this pizza all the time when downtown, usually when running around at events like First Night or the Gallery Crawls...not the best pizza I have ever had in my life, but it's not bad!  And I haven't ever gotten sick from it.  Just wanted to offer a different opinion.","PIzza Parma's decent tasting mega-big-2ft-long hot sausage hoagie was let down by the piss poor attitude of the staff, the lack of cleanliness of the tables and floor, the out-of-order red door restroom, the bright yellow for no-explicable reason walls. \n\nThe large color-striped 80's retro tables and green chairs have come back in style but this win is purely accidental and achieved only by laziness and lack of renovation.\n\nThat is all.","My fiance & I have lived in downtown Pittsburgh for over a year + now & this place is fabulous. \nMy sweetie LOVES LOVES LOVESSS pizza & we order from here a ton.  We haven't ordered anything here that wasn't super tasty.\nThe shop is small & the decor is super bright which makes you want to get in & out quickly but who the hell eats in there anyways. ... you're grabbing your order & running.","I'm glad I listened to my friend's recommendation and not some of these bad reviews. We're just in town for the night and wanted something delivered to our hotel. They said it would take an hour, which I expected on Super Bowl Sunday right at game time, but it was here in less than half an hour. \n\nThe pizza was delicious! Just the right balance of cheese and a tasty sauce, generous with the toppings, and a nicely crispy crust but not too thin.","This place has great service! My best friend and I got 2 custom orders and the older guy in back came out to the register to take our orders personally.  I assume he's either the cook, owner, or both. We ordered 2 cheeselss pizzas; a lot of places mess this up. Pizza Parma however, makes great cheeseless pizza. Our personal pizzas were nice and toasty, not over nor undercooked, and it was not dried out at all! There was more than enough sauce mmmmmmmmm.","My fiance & I have lived in downtown Pittsburgh for over a year + now & this place is fabulous. \nMy sweetie LOVES LOVES LOVESSS pizza & we order from here a ton.

to eat and a local told me this was \"the best pizza in the city.\"  I got a plain slice and a pepperoni slice. Possibly the worst pizza I have ever eaten.  This wouldn't even qualify as pizza in North Jersey.  I ate half of the plain slice because I was starving....then threw both in the garbage.  \n\nIf this is really the best pizza in Pittsburgh... wow.","I ordered from Pizza Parma out of storm necessity. I ordered a chicken parmigiana \"hoagie\", which was dry and luke warm. The potato bacon soup was like something out of a can, except the chunks of potato were hard and undercooked..all pretty nasty and overly salty.\n\nNever order from them.","Zero stars. Came in 10 mins before close. Female manager on duty asked for $100 in exchange for a pizza. When we refused she said she could not serve us because her employees had been working since 9am..,it is currently 2:00 am... Sounds pretty illegal to me","Average pizza. But with ten guys working - and not much business at the moment - it still took twenty minutes to get a slice of pepperoni. I'll walk across the street next time.","My butthole hasn't been right for days, nor my stomach. \n\nWe ordered in because we all had a long day and were set to have a family movie night.\n\nA pizza and hoagie. \n\nThe hoagie wasn't anything to run and go scream from the rooftops about but the pizza was covered in little ass ruining intestinal demons and this I am nearly sure of.\n\nI had to be talked out of sending pizza Parma a bill for several rolls of toilet paper.\n\nBe weary of the pizza, distrustful actually.\n\nYour butthole will thank me for it!","Hubby and I dropped in after a hellish morning at the Social Security office. Hubby loves pizza so we made a stop.\n\nPizza wan't bad, it was actually pretty decent. But the place was disgusting and the cashier was incredibly rude.","I eat this pizza all the time when downtown, usually when running around at events like First Night or the Gallery Crawls...not the best pizza I have ever had in my life, but it's not bad!  And I haven't ever gotten sick from it.  Just wanted to offer a different opinion.","PIzza Parma's decent tasting mega-big-2ft-long hot sausage hoagie was let down by the piss poor attitude of the staff, the lack of cleanliness of the tables and floor, the out-of-order red door restroom, the bright yellow for no-explicable reason walls. \n\nThe large color-striped 80's retro tables and green chairs have come back in style but this win is purely accidental and achieved only by laziness and lack of renovation.\n\nThat is all.","My fiance & I have lived in downtown Pittsburgh for over a year + now & this place is fabulous. \nMy sweetie LOVES LOVES LOVESSS pizza & we order from here a ton.  We haven't ordered anything here that wasn't super tasty.\nThe shop is small & the decor is super bright which makes you want to get in & out quickly but who the hell eats in there anyways. ... you're grabbing your order & running.","I'm glad I listened to my friend's recommendation and not some of these bad reviews. We're just in town for the night and wanted something delivered to our hotel. They said it would take an hour, which I expected on Super Bowl Sunday right at game time, but it was here in less than half an hour. \n\nThe pizza was delicious! Just the right balance of cheese and a tasty sauce, generous with the toppings, and a nicely crispy crust but not too thin.","This place has great service! My best friend and I got 2 custom orders and the older guy in back came out to the register to take our orders personally.  I assume he's either the cook, owner, or both. We ordered 2 cheeselss pizzas; a lot of places mess this up. Pizza Parma however, makes great cheeseless pizza. Our personal pizzas were nice and toasty, not over nor undercooked, and it was not dried out at all! There was more than enough sauce mmmmmmmmm.","My fiance & I have lived in downtown Pittsburgh for over a year + now & this place is fabulous. \nMy sweetie LOVES LOVES LOVESSS pizza & we order from here a ton.

waiter was to be found about ten minutes later they gave us our water and left again! It wasn't even busy! There were only TWO dim sum carts floating around somewhere. Then our waiter finally came around and took our orders of lunch entrees. The food was not even that good as the reviews that are posted on here. When we came up to pay, the bill was super overpriced. I will not be returning here, I am better off eating at Great Wall Cuisine.","If this place had zero stars I would have given them that ! Let me start off by saying I was so excited to read all great reviews so maybe I just came in on a off day? We walked in and were seated came over and asked if we wanted water or tea I guess they don't serve anything Else, Then we placed an order pork dumplings and sticky rice nasty! Then I asked if they served egg rolls they said they were out!!! they pushed their little carts around with hot plates that basically steam the food and is not fresh and what you get is soggy poor customer service we had to get up and look for someone to give us our tab so we could get the heck out of there are get some real food. It looked like it would be a great place for groups of people would not recommend if you are on mission for what you want and want to place an order but it could be a fun experience for some people.","You walk into a Chinese restaurant on a Saturday afternoon for dim sum and you expect the place to be PACKED.  Well, walking in to a pretty much empty dining room, it's a VERY CLEAR SIGN.  But my friend insisted and I was very hesitant for good reasons.  Another indicator, the majority of the patrons were NON Asian.  \n\nFood: You walk in and you see carts of the food by the entrance to the dining room.  Umm, I thought dim sum should come right off the steamer and into the carts and they roll it around, not sitting around.  The dim sum was garbage.  It had the typical selection, but at minimum.  \n\nService: It's ok.  But it doesn't make up for the horrible food.\n\nBottom line: NO WAY!  Stay away!","I've been here many times...Mother's Day with family, dim sum with book club, etc. But I will not go back again.  I stopped in to ask the owner about a donation or reduced price for a class of under-privileged kids that I volunteer with.  His reaction was to scoff and shoo me out the door while handing me his card and saying I could email him.  He turned his back and headed off to the messy newspaper-strewn table he haunts between guests arrivals.  Maybe he's a community-minded business owner, but then again, maybe he's not.  I'll be dining elsewhere.","Being from Chicago, we are used to getting authentic Chinese food all the time.  But when we first starting spending a lot of time in Scottsdale/Phoenix, we found it a challenge to get authentic Chinese food.  We were excited to find the Golden Buddha and have made many trips over the years all the way from the Troon North area to get our fix.  However, service has declined to the point where it is no longer worth the aggravation.  We went there last night for Chinese New Year and will never go back.  Granted they were very busy because of a lot of large tables there, but waiting almost an hour to get our food is not acceptable under any circumstance!  45 mins. into our wait, the waitress came back (after we flagged her down to ask about our food) and said one of the dishes we ordered was not available....after 45 mins.!!!! What makes the whole experience an unforgivable one is that the manager/owner is so indifferent and never apologized or offered a discount off the bill...nothing.  When we left, the same manager was at the piano singing in Chinese. Huh?  Other than Nee House in Scottsdale, the search goes on for a restaurant that serves authentic Chinese food closer to home.","I will NEVER go there again.  I reserved a table for a group of 16 people for 5:00 PM on Christmas Eve .  The person on the phone ( I believe the manager) repeatedly asked me to call ahead and give him an accurate head count since he said they'd be swamped that day.  I followed up with him twice.  \nWhen the first couple of us arrived, we had menus shoved in our faces immediately and told we \"Must order now.  Must order now\" because they were going to be busy later on.  The place was practically empty.  As each person arrived, they were treated the same way. \nWe rushed and placed our orders and then they brought out our checks WAY before we saw any sign of our food.  I have never in my life been treated so rudely by a restaurant.\nIt was utter chaos when the food started coming out while everyone struggled to get the correct dish they ordered.  One person didn't get her food until we were all just about finished eating. \nOne top of all that, the food wasn't even good.  I've had better Kung Pao Chicken at Panda Express!\nAfter being rushed through our meal, the place wasn't even half full by the time we left.  I thought being at the Cultural Center, this restaurant would be a sure thing but boy was I wrong.  Lovely way to spend Christmas Eve..","If you are looking a chinese restaurant to host a big party look some other than the Golden Buddah.  I recently attended a banquet at the Golden Buddah and I was shocked at the level of quality of food and service.  Of the 10 dishes served 4 were nearly inedible.  \n\nThere was a crab claw appetizer, most chinese restaurants prepare this dish by taking a crab claw surrounding it with ground shrimp, batter and then deep fry.  At Golden Buddah, the crab claw served was mostly batter.  \n\nThe shark fin soup served was mostly broth.  Shark fin is an expensive ingredient and most places usually use imitation shark fin, but come on at least put something in there so that I know I'm eating soup and not dirty sink water.  \n\nGinger scallion lobster is battered, fried, and then stir fried in a sauce with ginger and scallions.  The ginger scallion lobster served was over-cooked and dried out.  \n\nLastly, there was a steamed fish.  The fish was raw in the middle.   \n\nIt wasn't all bad, there was a crispy chicken with garlic dish that was pretty good, but out of 10 dishes 4 were bad, 5 were okay, and 1 was good.  \n\nDoes 4 bad dishes out of 10 warrant a one star rating?  Well it does when you factor in the service.  The soup, appetizer, and first entree arrived timely, but after that there was a 1 hour gap before we received the next dish.  The dishes were not served with accompanying white rice which I thought was odd.  We had to ask for it, and even the rice took a while to arrive.","I agree with Crystal C., that the dim sum isn't the greatest I've ever had. In fact, I am not sure if the meal was so tasty that it was memorable. I do remember the \"calamari\" was not really calamari, like you would think. It was presented more like a sweet and sour pork (so calamari with LOTS of breading) without any sauce. As a result, the dish was dry and salty.\n\nThe sticky rice was good (hard to mess up), the chicken feet were okay (needed more five spice powder), and the shumai was alright. The noodles were good, and I can see why the cart ran out after the first round. The diners were an equal mix of Asians and Americans. I would've preferred to see more Asians eating (as I am used to in a Chinatown and gives an indication of authenticity), but I do realize we're in Phoenix where the Asian population is not like San Francisco or Houston. \n\nThe meal came to about $30 for two, including jasmine tea. The carts are loud because they are made out of metal and roll on tile. I am also not used to staff members shouting what they have in their cart, like a newspaper boy yelling \"Extra! Extra!\" Christmas music was playing after mid-January, so the atmosphere felt strange. Next time I visit the city, I probably will pass.","Can't say that I was very impressed. Came for dinner in a hopeful and enthusiastic mood since the reviews have been pretty good, but I don't think this place lives up to its current good, but declining rating.\n\nOrdered the Combo fried rice (shrimp, chicken, beef, pork), sesame chicken, and garlic fried chicken. \n\nThe combo fried rice was pretty good, but ended up drinking about 6 glasses of water due to the MSG and sodium content. You'd think that the cook spent his better years in the French Foreign Legion in the Sahara eating salt tablets and developed a taste for them. \n\nThe sesame chicken had a good flavor and a thick brown sweet sauce. I liked it a lot until it got cool and the sauce looked (with that stringy consistency) more like glue. You think I'm kidding? I'm not.\n\nGarlic fried chicken was bad. Just bad. It was like an over roasted dried out half chicken with some dried garlic pieces sprinkled on top. No spices, no flavor, no good. \n\nWe then got all kinds of lip from the waitress when we asked if they could change the channel on the TV from college football, to the Suns game. They made it into this big deal that the \"customers\" wanted to see the football game. Yeah right, it was University of West Virginia Vs. University of Connecticut! I would have believed it if it was a local team....\n\nIt's better than a 1 star joint, but only because it's borderline edible. To be avoided.","This restaurant is located in the Chinese Cultural Center and was the one restaurant that I had not been to. So after some shopping at one of the shops, we stepped in to have dinner.\n\nWe stepped in and asked for a seat for two. We were seated immediately. The place was decorated nicely and a lady playing the piano made for great ambiance.\n\nWe looked at the menu briefly and ordered our drinks, an appetizer, a soup and two main dishes. The drinks came out promptly and so did the rest of the meal. My goodness everything we ordered was very tasty.\n\nThe waiter service itself however was not even close to the decor and food. He never introduced himself, and although he took our order, our food itself was brought out by a kitchen person.\n\nAfter we ordered our waiter really never came back asking if we needed anything else, except to give us our check at the end and that was after the person I was dining with got up and asked a different waiter for it.\n\nIt's amazing how a place with great food, decor, and ambiance can mess it all up by crappy waiter service.","I love Dim Sum, my favorite Chinese dish.\n\nWhen Golden Buddha first open, they have excellent Dim sum. I went there many times, I tell my friend how good it is, But now,  they change cook, taste more like  week old left over. Rumor has it, they change cook every few month, so Quality of cooking change. (not sure if that is true, but that is what I was told.)\nMy advice is; when you walk in the door and the place is pack, = Good Cook. if the place is bare = bad cook. leave immediately. don't waste your money.","If you just \"want\" dim sum, go here. If you are \"craving\" dim sum, go elsewhere (take a 5 hour drive west to neighboring state, California).\n\nAnyway, I've been visiting Golden Buddha in the noontime for roughly 2 years now. I believe they moved from their original site (7th St. & Osborn), formerly \"China Doll.\" Relocation brought along better atmosphere and smiling faces. This does not mean, better dim sum. But since we are in Phoenix, I will settle for what they have to offer. \n\nBe mindful of the dim sum tab. It's itemized high-medium-low. \n\nShaomai can be found as combinations of pork/mushroom, shrimp, or shark fin (which should not be confused as true shark bits, as the shaomai is prepared to look like a shark's fin). These picks are okay...perhaps on a better day shao mai will be served in less-rigid, or fresher wrappers. Potstickers are okay as well, just the usual scallion and pork, and dry wrapper. The baby pork ribs in light black bean sauce and jalapenos is alright, but sometimes lacks in taste. Tripe is also served in its bare minimum...so if you enjoy the texture and flavor of tripe, try this with its clear sauce and thinly sliced carrots and celery.  \nBuche (that's what I call it), or fried sesame balls are also available, although if you wait until dessert, they will also be a bit stiff. There are a few other things that may be \"spotted\" but are not worth mentioning. \n\nDon't order from their lunch menu, as you can find these over-salted dishes at Panda Express anyway. \n\nOverall, dim sum at Golden Buddha is a place to go if you are around the vicinity and feel like having something apart from the usual fast food. However, discriminating palates- beware.","Not impressed with this place at all. This was not the friendliest place around, maybe because of the language barrier (most or all were clearly native Chinese speakers), or maybe just the attitude of the employees.\n\nI ordered the sweet and sour chicken lunch, which came with the typical egg drop soup, crab rangoon, and egg roll. The soup was ok - maybe it's just me, but I prefer a real spoon to the scoop that they gave me. The egg roll was tiny and not that great, and the crab rangoon was ok, but maybe a little undercooked. The chicken wasn't bad, but nothing special, as was the rice and other stuff on the plate.\n\nOverall, this was just not my kind of Chinese place.","Disappointing.  Mediocre at best.  I am staying at the Aloft hotel in phoenix and ordered some delivery. I ordered a couple american chinese food staples: general tso's chicken, dumplings and hot&sour soup.  Soup had zero flavor, dumplings tasted freezer burned and processed.  General tso chicken was ehh. \n\nA lot of good reviews on here so it must be for eat in and for their dim sum.  Don't order delivery, you will be left hungry and unsatisfied.","Went there on Saturday for early lunch.  My wife did the dim sum, it was okay, we were both disgusted by the sugar cane shrimp; but the rest was good.  \n\nI ordered the chicken szechwuan, the waitress warned me it was \"spicy\" the reason I ordered it.  It came out delicious, but not what I would call spicy.  Overall its hard to find good Chinese in the valley and I would call this good without hesitation.","So I was referred to this place from the front desk of my hotel. I'm from SF so I'm coming from a place with really good chinese food. \n\nThe dim sum is just \"ok\" nothing for me to write home about. The one dish that I really liked was the chinese broccoli cooked with garlic sauce. Yum yum yum.  It's in a big bowl, not oily, not saucy, just really good. I think it's $7.50.  \n\nIt's a somewhat pricey and just like all chinese restaurants, it's not the cleanest.  The chair was filthy.  the dishes weren't all that great.  I wouldn't go back unless I want the chinese broccoli.  \n\nSo I went on a Sunday and it was not crowded at all. There's not a huge asian population  in Phoenix (not that I could tell) so I don't think there's a high demand for dim sum.  And also, I sooooooo felt like taking a pic of this, but a Mexican lady was pushing one of the dim sum carts. That is unheard of in SF.  This is a mainly mandarin restaurant and the dim sum places I go are usually cantonese.  Not a big deal though since the dishes look the same. \n\nDude, there was a turtle in the fish tank that I saw as I left.  I hope they don't eat that!","A Premier Chinese Atmosphere,\nThe Chinese cultural center and Asian Garden produces an Asain atmosphere that can be recognized from the 202.  \n With Dim Sum served this location earns its respect from the local community.\n\nDim Sum tip,  You have to be smart with the Dim Sum ladies they look nice innocent but they are professional sales people that will sell you more dishes than you need before you know what to do.  \n\nI love the desserts here ask the server to see the dessert tray.","This restaurant has a bit of an identity crisis. It is in the Chinese cultural center, but serves Japanese beer (Kirin on tap!) and the live piano music is American pop. We had to ask for chopsticks.\n\nHaving said that, the service was professional. Our waiter held a hot appetizer for one of our party who was away from the table so that it would not be cold when he returned. We were asked frequently--and not too frequently--if things were ok both by our waiter and the manager/proprietor.\n\nThe food was ok-to-good. Fried shrimp egg rolls were dainty but yummy. Duck was tasty but very chewy. Kung-pao chicken was pleasantly spiced. Plenty of rice. A pitcher of ice water with lemon was left at the table. \n\nAtmosphere was also pleasant. Chairs comfortable, tables spaced well, restrooms large and clean...and there is indeed a large golden Buddha by the entrance.","I took a group of friends here and relatives other times. The place is consistently good for Dim-sum during lunch. It is typical Chinese and nothing fancy.\n\nWhat helps this place is the moat scenery.  3 stars for visiting here based on convenience since there are similar places in town.","Having grown up in Hong Kong and having eaten dim sum in London, NY, LA, SF and Vancouver (actually Richmond), I can confidently say I know my dim sum.\n\nGood selection of well-executed dim sum when the carts actually come around and there's anything left in it.  I'd give it 4 stars for food but the wait definitely detracted from the whole experience.\n\nI think the problem with Golden Buddha is that they can't handle the heavy flow on weekends.  There's not enough regular dim sum eaters like LA that can sustain a steady flow of diners throughout the week, forcing restaurants like Golden Buddha to depend heavily on extra part-time help on weekends.  \n\nDim sum takes serious skill so the chef still ends up doing most of the work.  When we looked into the kitchen, we saw a Chinese woman doing most of the cooking herself.  No wonder it took forever for a cart to come out and when it does, it's swarmed on by a pack of vultures.\n\nIf you're willing to eat at a more simply decorated place with a smaller menu, I'd highly recommend China Chan.  It's much more relaxed - usually no wait on weekends.  An experienced chef makes all the dim sum himself so the menu's much shorter but all the classics are on it.  Anything steamed is made to order so is very fresh.","Situated in the Chinese Cultural Center near the SkyHarbor Airport, this was another pleasant find. All I had was the Dim Sum menu, and I would say this is the best you're gonna get in Phoenix. Still worth the stop to get your Dim Sum fix. The cart ladies were pleasant and very happy to converse with me in Cantonese. Only downside was the chicken sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaves, naw mei gai, was way overcooked, and mushy.","Do you want to eat Chinese Food in an elegant environment on a Friday night in Phoenix? \n\nBe entertained by classic, quiet standards being played live on a piano while you dine?\n\nAre you 50 years old and Caucasian?\n\nThen the Golden Buddha is the place for you! \n\nIts in the Chinese Cultural Center Mall on 44th, and a popular weekend spot for Dim Sum. For a DIm Sum starved Valley of the Sun, Golden Buddha's is decent. \n\nFor dinner, though, it is awfully Americanized and not very authentic Chinese. But with a bunch of American customers coming for dinner, what do you expect? They probably think they are getting \"real Chinese\" food by going to the Chinese Mall, but then again, they are used to PF Chang's or Stix normally in their neighborhood, so this is a step up.\n\nThe best thing about this place is the decor, which is clean and nice, with a Hong Kong Junk boat design covering the ceiling from the bar into the dining room. The next best thing is the Piano interludes on weekend nights. The service is next, which is a little overly eager to remove your plate, and the last thing is the food. \n\nThey do give decent portions. I ordered Guo Teh (potstickers) and got 6 fat ones. But they weren't served with the usual soy, chili oil and vinegar, but a soy and green onions mixture. The Mapo Tofu was ok, as they used a nice silky tofu, which was nice, but no green onions, and sliced black mushrooms instead, which I like, but not in this dish.\n\nCome here for the ambiance and music in the evenings, or on the weekend days for Dim Sum.","Decent dim sum, especially to be found in the middle of the desert. Sadly, the best food I've had in Phoenix.","This place is a little difficult for me to review.  I was staying at the Hampton Inn across the street and this is the closest restaurant so off I went.\n\nI walked in and the owner or manager met me at the door and asked \"how many\"?\n\nI told him I wanted to order take out and handed me a menu and pointed to the waiting area which was covered in newspapers.  I chose to go to the bar, order a glass of wine, and peruse the menu.\n\nThe drinks are expensive but I didn't think the food was.  Less than $10 for my Mongolian Chicken which came with white sticky rice and a fortune cookie.  When ordering I asked if I could have fried rice instead of white rice but was told \"no\".  Most places allow this for a nominal fee.\n\nFine by me.  Give the white rice.  Food was prepared and their to-go boxes were a lot better than the standard white Chinese \"to go\" boxes.  They also included the plastic-ware, napkin, and soy sauce, which a lot of places forget.\n\nLooking around I found a whole lot of goodness along with a couple disappointments.  Most notably the newspaper strewn about and behind the bar, to the right were a lot of boxes stacked in an unsightly fashion.  I could have been a little more presentable in my opinion.\n\nI peeked into the dining room because I wanted to see if the piano music was piped in or live.  It was live which was very nice. Also, the dinning room looked very nice and cozy.\n\nAs I was leaving the same man who greeted me upon entering made sure to wish me a good evening.  My initial impression of the man was that he was surly and testy but that's just how he comes off.\n\nThe food was very good.  The Mongolian sauce was mixture of sweet with spice and the chicken and vegetables all tasted fresh.","My husband and I went there Saturday, the service was great!  Our friends were going to be late so they told us to start.  And start we did!\nThey were serving Dim Sum, something we had never tried, so glad we did, it was wonderful, hubby wouldn't do the chicken feet, but I think next time I will, it looked very good.\nOur friends showed up and ordered their food, and ate all of it, they said that usually they take food home, but it was so good they had to eat all of it!\nWe will be going back very soon!","Let's see, over 50... check \nold white man...........check \neats dinner ...............check \nlistens to the piano  check \n\nwow this must be the place for me, I mean after all it is in a Chinese mall, no make that a Chinese Cultural Center. How could I possibly have discerning taste with such trickery to get me here to eat. \nDude if you are going to rate a restaurant no need to degrade others with your arrogance. \nFool is my review of wanugee N. \n\nNow on the restaurant. The last time we were here the food was not good, the piano was too loud and the waitress had a real attitude. IT won't keep me from going back as I have had good meals and wait service too. \n\nBack to wanugee N. I do not expect any place in Phx. to have authentic Chinese food, by that I mean the street food one finds in China. \nBut I do expect what I fork in to my mouth is worth what I am going to fork over in cost. Even an old white guy like me can tell the difference between good and bad food. No matter what it is called.","Okay so Ive been glum the past few days as I have an impending birthday. Every year this time I get all down in the dumps.. not that I'm not happy with my life cause life is good. Its more like getting further away from my youth and closer to being well, old. All of my grandparents were crotchety, sourpuss drama queens.. is that my fate? Can I break the mold or am I to going to be a crotchety sourpuss?\n\nSo as I contemplate and figure out what I'm going to do with my birthday baggage I decide to squash it with food. All weekend Ive been eating out and having a good time. This is one of the few times outside of a vacation where I will live it completely and to the near of sheer gluttony. So why not dim sum? \n\nIve chowed much dim sum in my 36 years of earthen wear.. of course some good and some bad. I have never been to a place where every dish was great.. Golden Buddha is no exception to this.. they do the basics well enough and have enough funky cool Asian style to keep me interested in returning. The carts around 1130 flow well but around noon it' s full blown freeway action! In fact there might be some road kill in there based on some of the looks on that last steam cart.. \n\nMe and 3 others who were feeling my pain ordered 14, count them, 14 different dishes. One of my friends is from Georgia and had never had dim sum but he is so courageous and unflinching that he was just a blast. Just the shot in the arm to get me out of my funk. I remember the first time I had dim sum.. my eyes wide open, nostrils flared and excited to see what was under the next steamer lid. That was him today.. one exciting thing after the next.. he was even willing to try chicken feet but this is one of those dishes not done very well here. \n\nMy friend took me back to a time where I was younger and less experienced. He looked up to me to guide him through the noodles, bao and sui mai.. like a big brother.. I'm privileged that I could show him something new and exciting and he was so into it! So instead of feeling sorry for myself I felt experienced and useful.. that there is something I can give back to others.. that its not all about me and me aging but about what can be shared with others.\n\nThere is so much more to do, give and feel in this short time we are here.. and Ill do it to, one bite at a time.","The best to be found in land locked Arizona.  My favorite sticky rice is here.  They have dim sum every day, but not a huge selection, though you can order off the menu.  I think it is much bigger on the weekends.  I'm just happy I can get my fix 7 days a week.  Beautiful gardens to walk through, with fish ponds, and a 99 market next door!","I ate at Golden Buddha a few weeks ago.  We ate at the restaurant after a day at the zoo with our 4 year old and had a blast.  The piano bar played tunes for my daughter and the staff was more than accommodating.  The general tso chicken was better than anything I can get in Tucson.  The soup was chocked full of fresh, read FRESH, not canned, vegetables.  All in all, I was very satisfied with the meal and the service.  Plus the decor is very nice, clean and cheery. \n\nEat at Golden Buddha.","For those who gave this place low marks, forgive me. I really like this place. Now I haven't tried various dim sum places so I'm reserving the right to downgrade the place as needed. The variety of food is plentiful, and the carts just keep on coming. I love the steamed pork buns, and the shiu mai (not sure if I spelled that correctly). Yesterday, my favorite pick was the deep fried rolls of taro and shrimp. YUM! I have never ordered from their menu so I can only talk about their dim sum. My friends and I try to go eat dim sum almost every Sunday. It's a cheap way to try new foods, and if you don't like it, well.. you can get away with pushing it aside with minimal guilt. Give it a try! You might be surprised.","I like Golden Buddha, have taken many friends there for Dim Sum.  \nTry not to \"hit\" the dumpling cart to heavy; otherwise cannot finish it to the dessert cart (LOL).\nLove the jasmine tea and the staff willing to help you if you do not understand the what each item is.\nSingapore Rice Noodles a favorite, along with any of the shrimp dumplings; also the broccoli and green beans.\nOnly wish that the carts with eggplant stuffed with shrimp or green peppers with shrimp were not on \"heated\" carts; by the time it gets to you the food is cold.\nOnly concern is that went on 22MAY2010 at 1:30PM; there was a closed sign due to electricity???\nREVISED: 26MAY2010 - called this evening - looks like they are back open again.","I've been to the Golden Buddha on several occasions and it is my favorite, by far, for honest Chinese food. \nWhile I've sampled everything from their vegetarian to their beef, I love their mandarin chicken. More recently, I was delighted to relive the wonders of their Kung Pao Chicken and Beef with Broccoli. \nI absolutely love the egg drop soup and mini crab rangoons that come with the meal.","The very first time I went to Golden Buddha was with my BFF and it was our first dim sum experience. Little did I know this would forever change my life and eating experiences. Although I must admit that first time was a bit awkward.\n\nGB wisely takes reservations which was wonderful (even though it wasn't crazy busy). Our assorted dim sum plates were flavorful and fresh. And the carts seemed to be in constant rotation so we were never too far from a good selection.\n\nWhat really helps GB is its location. The Cofco Center is an experience in itself, where one can have herbs specially blended, select a fresh member of marine life to take home and cook or browse through a store with one of the largest selections of Buddhas and hand fans I've experienced outside of San Francisco.","I've been to Golden Buddha a few times and have not been disappointed. \n\nThey have a LARGE selection of Dim Sum and if you're not careful you can get carried away.\n\nTry and get there early and you'll get the best and most fresh selection.\nMake sure you walk around the garden when you're done.","Probably the most comprehensive Chinese menu in the Valley.  Pick from well over 100 dishes, but if you want the best order the Peking Duck.  Everything else is very good, but without a wow factor.  You'll see lots of Chinese people in this massive restaurant, which probably means they're doing a fine job in the kitchen.","I very much enjoyed eating here. Food was great. Fairly fast service. Wasn't expensive either for the 4 of us.","Golden Buddha has GREAT dim sum.  Their prices are reasonable and the staff is very polite wheeling their little carts.  I tend to go on the weekend because there is more selection but they do dim sum throughout the week.  They also have some very authentic dishes on the menu for those who are more of the adventurous types.  Be sure to say hello to the turtles the next time you go.","This place in the Chinese Cultural Center has a very pretty and elegant bar area. I was pleased to learn that they had some very reasonable and delicious happy hour snacks. This is a good place for a Pina Colada. I had one by myself along with some dumplings and fried shrimp appetizer. Sadly I never brought anyone else here with me. It was happy hour heaven but you know? A lot of my friends in AZ pretty much hang out in one neighborhood or another and nobody I know really lives close to the Buddha.\nThe airport is pretty close by. This might be a good pre-flight send-off location.","I have had dim sum in New Orleans and Phoenix (not SF), and this is about equal to the best of New Orleans as far as flavor.\nAs for ambiance, today was a good day. I've had dim sum here about a dozen times, and have had very good service and quality 90% of the time, including weekends. I have had bad days here, but since today was good, I'll rate accordingly. It's closer to a 4.5, but since I can't give half-stars, I rounded up.\nDon't expect me to give these the right names, but... I was less than impressed with the bbq pork balls. They tasted too much like honey and the beef was minimal. The bbq sauce tasted bottled. Outside of that, their herbal hot tea is delicious even on a hot day.\nThe shu mai were very good, and the shrimp in a spinach dumpling was fantastic. A definite don't miss is their sticky rice in lotus leaf. It's among the best I've had anywhere. Just be careful; you'll find bones in it every once in a while. Go for any of their steamed dumplings; they're very flavorful. As others have said, I love the Chinese broccoli, but you'll only find it on the carts on weekends. Otherwise order it off the menu.\nToday (11:30 lunch) the carts came around often, and everything except the pork buns was piping hot and fresh. By the way, despite the price increases, even the sticky rice was considered a medium size entree, and the two of us eating there escaped with a bill under $20 and we were done in under 30 minutes.\nI strongly recommend the dim sum here, whether you've had it a million times or have never had it before. You usually won't be disappointed.","I don't really understand the poor reviews on this place.....maybe it depends on the day you go? We went on a Sunday, it was crazy busy, but service was great! (of course, my view of customer service is a little different then the rest... I used to live on an island where you were just happy to find what you were looking for, let alone expect good customer service) Anyways, our server was very sweet! Always had a smile on her face. The carts served us promplty and none of the food was cold. They always had whatever we wanted (I hate having to wait for the next cart).\n\nNow, as for the actual dim sum and food.......holy cow, to die for! So flavorful and fresh!! The broccoli makes you sing...and the wine noodles, make you cry. You leave with very weird mixed emotions, but mostly a happy belly full of yummy food.\n\nIn my opinion, this is the best dim sum I have been able to find in Phx. I'm ditching my previous spot (Mekong Palace) and will be back to Golden Buddha when the dim sum monster strikes again!"],"type":["Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low

waiter was to be found about ten minutes later they gave us our water and left again! It wasn't even busy! There were only TWO dim sum carts floating around somewhere. Then our waiter finally came around and took our orders of lunch entrees. The food was not even that good as the reviews that are posted on here. When we came up to pay, the bill was super overpriced. I will not be returning here, I am better off eating at Great Wall Cuisine.","If this place had zero stars I would have given them that ! Let me start off by saying I was so excited to read all great reviews so maybe I just came in on a off day? We walked in and were seated came over and asked if we wanted water or tea I guess they don't serve anything Else, Then we placed an order pork dumplings and sticky rice nasty! Then I asked if they served egg rolls they said they were out!!! they pushed their little carts around with hot plates that basically steam the food and is not fresh and what you get is soggy poor customer service we had to get up and look for someone to give us our tab so we could get the heck out of there are get some real food. It looked like it would be a great place for groups of people would not recommend if you are on mission for what you want and want to place an order but it could be a fun experience for some people.","You walk into a Chinese restaurant on a Saturday afternoon for dim sum and you expect the place to be PACKED.  Well, walking in to a pretty much empty dining room, it's a VERY CLEAR SIGN.  But my friend insisted and I was very hesitant for good reasons.  Another indicator, the majority of the patrons were NON Asian.  \n\nFood: You walk in and you see carts of the food by the entrance to the dining room.  Umm, I thought dim sum should come right off the steamer and into the carts and they roll it around, not sitting around.  The dim sum was garbage.  It had the typical selection, but at minimum.  \n\nService: It's ok.  But it doesn't make up for the horrible food.\n\nBottom line: NO WAY!  Stay away!","I've been here many times...Mother's Day with family, dim sum with book club, etc. But I will not go back again.  I stopped in to ask the owner about a donation or reduced price for a class of under-privileged kids that I volunteer with.  His reaction was to scoff and shoo me out the door while handing me his card and saying I could email him.  He turned his back and headed off to the messy newspaper-strewn table he haunts between guests arrivals.  Maybe he's a community-minded business owner, but then again, maybe he's not.  I'll be dining elsewhere.","Being from Chicago, we are used to getting authentic Chinese food all the time.  But when we first starting spending a lot of time in Scottsdale/Phoenix, we found it a challenge to get authentic Chinese food.  We were excited to find the Golden Buddha and have made many trips over the years all the way from the Troon North area to get our fix.  However, service has declined to the point where it is no longer worth the aggravation.  We went there last night for Chinese New Year and will never go back.  Granted they were very busy because of a lot of large tables there, but waiting almost an hour to get our food is not acceptable under any circumstance!  45 mins. into our wait, the waitress came back (after we flagged her down to ask about our food) and said one of the dishes we ordered was not available....after 45 mins.!!!! What makes the whole experience an unforgivable one is that the manager/owner is so indifferent and never apologized or offered a discount off the bill...nothing.  When we left, the same manager was at the piano singing in Chinese. Huh?  Other than Nee House in Scottsdale, the search goes on for a restaurant that serves authentic Chinese food closer to home.","I will NEVER go there again.  I reserved a table for a group of 16 people for 5:00 PM on Christmas Eve .  The person on the phone ( I believe the manager) repeatedly asked me to call ahead and give him an accurate head count since he said they'd be swamped that day.  I followed up with him twice.  \nWhen the first couple of us arrived, we had menus shoved in our faces immediately and told we \"Must order now.  Must order now\" because they were going to be busy later on.  The place was practically empty.  As each person arrived, they were treated the same way. \nWe rushed and placed our orders and then they brought out our checks WAY before we saw any sign of our food.  I have never in my life been treated so rudely by a restaurant.\nIt was utter chaos when the food started coming out while everyone struggled to get the correct dish they ordered.  One person didn't get her food until we were all just about finished eating. \nOne top of all that, the food wasn't even good.  I've had better Kung Pao Chicken at Panda Express!\nAfter being rushed through our meal, the place wasn't even half full by the time we left.  I thought being at the Cultural Center, this restaurant would be a sure thing but boy was I wrong.  Lovely way to spend Christmas Eve..","If you are looking a chinese restaurant to host a big party look some other than the Golden Buddah.  I recently attended a banquet at the Golden Buddah and I was shocked at the level of quality of food and service.  Of the 10 dishes served 4 were nearly inedible.  \n\nThere was a crab claw appetizer, most chinese restaurants prepare this dish by taking a crab claw surrounding it with ground shrimp, batter and then deep fry.  At Golden Buddah, the crab claw served was mostly batter.  \n\nThe shark fin soup served was mostly broth.  Shark fin is an expensive ingredient and most places usually use imitation shark fin, but come on at least put something in there so that I know I'm eating soup and not dirty sink water.  \n\nGinger scallion lobster is battered, fried, and then stir fried in a sauce with ginger and scallions.  The ginger scallion lobster served was over-cooked and dried out.  \n\nLastly, there was a steamed fish.  The fish was raw in the middle.   \n\nIt wasn't all bad, there was a crispy chicken with garlic dish that was pretty good, but out of 10 dishes 4 were bad, 5 were okay, and 1 was good.  \n\nDoes 4 bad dishes out of 10 warrant a one star rating?  Well it does when you factor in the service.  The soup, appetizer, and first entree arrived timely, but after that there was a 1 hour gap before we received the next dish.  The dishes were not served with accompanying white rice which I thought was odd.  We had to ask for it, and even the rice took a while to arrive.","I agree with Crystal C., that the dim sum isn't the greatest I've ever had. In fact, I am not sure if the meal was so tasty that it was memorable. I do remember the \"calamari\" was not really calamari, like you would think. It was presented more like a sweet and sour pork (so calamari with LOTS of breading) without any sauce. As a result, the dish was dry and salty.\n\nThe sticky rice was good (hard to mess up), the chicken feet were okay (needed more five spice powder), and the shumai was alright. The noodles were good, and I can see why the cart ran out after the first round. The diners were an equal mix of Asians and Americans. I would've preferred to see more Asians eating (as I am used to in a Chinatown and gives an indication of authenticity), but I do realize we're in Phoenix where the Asian population is not like San Francisco or Houston. \n\nThe meal came to about $30 for two, including jasmine tea. The carts are loud because they are made out of metal and roll on tile. I am also not used to staff members shouting what they have in their cart, like a newspaper boy yelling \"Extra! Extra!\" Christmas music was playing after mid-January, so the atmosphere felt strange. Next time I visit the city, I probably will pass.","Can't say that I was very impressed. Came for dinner in a hopeful and enthusiastic mood since the reviews have been pretty good, but I don't think this place lives up to its current good, but declining rating.\n\nOrdered the Combo fried rice (shrimp, chicken, beef, pork), sesame chicken, and garlic fried chicken. \n\nThe combo fried rice was pretty good, but ended up drinking about 6 glasses of water due to the MSG and sodium content. You'd think that the cook spent his better years in the French Foreign Legion in the Sahara eating salt tablets and developed a taste for them. \n\nThe sesame chicken had a good flavor and a thick brown sweet sauce. I liked it a lot until it got cool and the sauce looked (with that stringy consistency) more like glue. You think I'm kidding? I'm not.\n\nGarlic fried chicken was bad. Just bad. It was like an over roasted dried out half chicken with some dried garlic pieces sprinkled on top. No spices, no flavor, no good. \n\nWe then got all kinds of lip from the waitress when we asked if they could change the channel on the TV from college football, to the Suns game. They made it into this big deal that the \"customers\" wanted to see the football game. Yeah right, it was University of West Virginia Vs. University of Connecticut! I would have believed it if it was a local team....\n\nIt's better than a 1 star joint, but only because it's borderline edible. To be avoided.","This restaurant is located in the Chinese Cultural Center and was the one restaurant that I had not been to. So after some shopping at one of the shops, we stepped in to have dinner.\n\nWe stepped in and asked for a seat for two. We were seated immediately. The place was decorated nicely and a lady playing the piano made for great ambiance.\n\nWe looked at the menu briefly and ordered our drinks, an appetizer, a soup and two main dishes. The drinks came out promptly and so did the rest of the meal. My goodness everything we ordered was very tasty.\n\nThe waiter service itself however was not even close to the decor and food. He never introduced himself, and although he took our order, our food itself was brought out by a kitchen person.\n\nAfter we ordered our waiter really never came back asking if we needed anything else, except to give us our check at the end and that was after the person I was dining with got up and asked a different waiter for it.\n\nIt's amazing how a place with great food, decor, and ambiance can mess it all up by crappy waiter service.","I love Dim Sum, my favorite Chinese dish.\n\nWhen Golden Buddha first open, they have excellent Dim sum. I went there many times, I tell my friend how good it is, But now,  they change cook, taste more like  week old left over. Rumor has it, they change cook every few month, so Quality of cooking change. (not sure if that is true, but that is what I was told.)\nMy advice is; when you walk in the door and the place is pack, = Good Cook. if the place is bare = bad cook. leave immediately. don't waste your money.","If you just \"want\" dim sum, go here. If you are \"craving\" dim sum, go elsewhere (take a 5 hour drive west to neighboring state, California).\n\nAnyway, I've been visiting Golden Buddha in the noontime for roughly 2 years now. I believe they moved from their original site (7th St. & Osborn), formerly \"China Doll.\" Relocation brought along better atmosphere and smiling faces. This does not mean, better dim sum. But since we are in Phoenix, I will settle for what they have to offer. \n\nBe mindful of the dim sum tab. It's itemized high-medium-low. \n\nShaomai can be found as combinations of pork/mushroom, shrimp, or shark fin (which should not be confused as true shark bits, as the shaomai is prepared to look like a shark's fin). These picks are okay...perhaps on a better day shao mai will be served in less-rigid, or fresher wrappers. Potstickers are okay as well, just the usual scallion and pork, and dry wrapper. The baby pork ribs in light black bean sauce and jalapenos is alright, but sometimes lacks in taste. Tripe is also served in its bare minimum...so if you enjoy the texture and flavor of tripe, try this with its clear sauce and thinly sliced carrots and celery.  \nBuche (that's what I call it), or fried sesame balls are also available, although if you wait until dessert, they will also be a bit stiff. There are a few other things that may be \"spotted\" but are not worth mentioning. \n\nDon't order from their lunch menu, as you can find these over-salted dishes at Panda Express anyway. \n\nOverall, dim sum at Golden Buddha is a place to go if you are around the vicinity and feel like having something apart from the usual fast food. However, discriminating palates- beware.","Not impressed with this place at all. This was not the friendliest place around, maybe because of the language barrier (most or all were clearly native Chinese speakers), or maybe just the attitude of the employees.\n\nI ordered the sweet and sour chicken lunch, which came with the typical egg drop soup, crab rangoon, and egg roll. The soup was ok - maybe it's just me, but I prefer a real spoon to the scoop that they gave me. The egg roll was tiny and not that great, and the crab rangoon was ok, but maybe a little undercooked. The chicken wasn't bad, but nothing special, as was the rice and other stuff on the plate.\n\nOverall, this was just not my kind of Chinese place.","Disappointing.  Mediocre at best.  I am staying at the Aloft hotel in phoenix and ordered some delivery. I ordered a couple american chinese food staples: general tso's chicken, dumplings and hot&sour soup.  Soup had zero flavor, dumplings tasted freezer burned and processed.  General tso chicken was ehh. \n\nA lot of good reviews on here so it must be for eat in and for their dim sum.  Don't order delivery, you will be left hungry and unsatisfied.","Went there on Saturday for early lunch.  My wife did the dim sum, it was okay, we were both disgusted by the sugar cane shrimp; but the rest was good.  \n\nI ordered the chicken szechwuan, the waitress warned me it was \"spicy\" the reason I ordered it.  It came out delicious, but not what I would call spicy.  Overall its hard to find good Chinese in the valley and I would call this good without hesitation.","So I was referred to this place from the front desk of my hotel. I'm from SF so I'm coming from a place with really good chinese food. \n\nThe dim sum is just \"ok\" nothing for me to write home about. The one dish that I really liked was the chinese broccoli cooked with garlic sauce. Yum yum yum.  It's in a big bowl, not oily, not saucy, just really good. I think it's $7.50.  \n\nIt's a somewhat pricey and just like all chinese restaurants, it's not the cleanest.  The chair was filthy.  the dishes weren't all that great.  I wouldn't go back unless I want the chinese broccoli.  \n\nSo I went on a Sunday and it was not crowded at all. There's not a huge asian population  in Phoenix (not that I could tell) so I don't think there's a high demand for dim sum.  And also, I sooooooo felt like taking a pic of this, but a Mexican lady was pushing one of the dim sum carts. That is unheard of in SF.  This is a mainly mandarin restaurant and the dim sum places I go are usually cantonese.  Not a big deal though since the dishes look the same. \n\nDude, there was a turtle in the fish tank that I saw as I left.  I hope they don't eat that!","A Premier Chinese Atmosphere,\nThe Chinese cultural center and Asian Garden produces an Asain atmosphere that can be recognized from the 202.  \n With Dim Sum served this location earns its respect from the local community.\n\nDim Sum tip,  You have to be smart with the Dim Sum ladies they look nice innocent but they are professional sales people that will sell you more dishes than you need before you know what to do.  \n\nI love the desserts here ask the server to see the dessert tray.","This restaurant has a bit of an identity crisis. It is in the Chinese cultural center, but serves Japanese beer (Kirin on tap!) and the live piano music is American pop. We had to ask for chopsticks.\n\nHaving said that, the service was professional. Our waiter held a hot appetizer for one of our party who was away from the table so that it would not be cold when he returned. We were asked frequently--and not too frequently--if things were ok both by our waiter and the manager/proprietor.\n\nThe food was ok-to-good. Fried shrimp egg rolls were dainty but yummy. Duck was tasty but very chewy. Kung-pao chicken was pleasantly spiced. Plenty of rice. A pitcher of ice water with lemon was left at the table. \n\nAtmosphere was also pleasant. Chairs comfortable, tables spaced well, restrooms large and clean...and there is indeed a large golden Buddha by the entrance.","I took a group of friends here and relatives other times. The place is consistently good for Dim-sum during lunch. It is typical Chinese and nothing fancy.\n\nWhat helps this place is the moat scenery.  3 stars for visiting here based on convenience since there are similar places in town.","Having grown up in Hong Kong and having eaten dim sum in London, NY, LA, SF and Vancouver (actually Richmond), I can confidently say I know my dim sum.\n\nGood selection of well-executed dim sum when the carts actually come around and there's anything left in it.  I'd give it 4 stars for food but the wait definitely detracted from the whole experience.\n\nI think the problem with Golden Buddha is that they can't handle the heavy flow on weekends.  There's not enough regular dim sum eaters like LA that can sustain a steady flow of diners throughout the week, forcing restaurants like Golden Buddha to depend heavily on extra part-time help on weekends.  \n\nDim sum takes serious skill so the chef still ends up doing most of the work.  When we looked into the kitchen, we saw a Chinese woman doing most of the cooking herself.  No wonder it took forever for a cart to come out and when it does, it's swarmed on by a pack of vultures.\n\nIf you're willing to eat at a more simply decorated place with a smaller menu, I'd highly recommend China Chan.  It's much more relaxed - usually no wait on weekends.  An experienced chef makes all the dim sum himself so the menu's much shorter but all the classics are on it.  Anything steamed is made to order so is very fresh.","Situated in the Chinese Cultural Center near the SkyHarbor Airport, this was another pleasant find. All I had was the Dim Sum menu, and I would say this is the best you're gonna get in Phoenix. Still worth the stop to get your Dim Sum fix. The cart ladies were pleasant and very happy to converse with me in Cantonese. Only downside was the chicken sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaves, naw mei gai, was way overcooked, and mushy.","Do you want to eat Chinese Food in an elegant environment on a Friday night in Phoenix? \n\nBe entertained by classic, quiet standards being played live on a piano while you dine?\n\nAre you 50 years old and Caucasian?\n\nThen the Golden Buddha is the place for you! \n\nIts in the Chinese Cultural Center Mall on 44th, and a popular weekend spot for Dim Sum. For a DIm Sum starved Valley of the Sun, Golden Buddha's is decent. \n\nFor dinner, though, it is awfully Americanized and not very authentic Chinese. But with a bunch of American customers coming for dinner, what do you expect? They probably think they are getting \"real Chinese\" food by going to the Chinese Mall, but then again, they are used to PF Chang's or Stix normally in their neighborhood, so this is a step up.\n\nThe best thing about this place is the decor, which is clean and nice, with a Hong Kong Junk boat design covering the ceiling from the bar into the dining room. The next best thing is the Piano interludes on weekend nights. The service is next, which is a little overly eager to remove your plate, and the last thing is the food. \n\nThey do give decent portions. I ordered Guo Teh (potstickers) and got 6 fat ones. But they weren't served with the usual soy, chili oil and vinegar, but a soy and green onions mixture. The Mapo Tofu was ok, as they used a nice silky tofu, which was nice, but no green onions, and sliced black mushrooms instead, which I like, but not in this dish.\n\nCome here for the ambiance and music in the evenings, or on the weekend days for Dim Sum.","Decent dim sum, especially to be found in the middle of the desert. Sadly, the best food I've had in Phoenix.","This place is a little difficult for me to review.  I was staying at the Hampton Inn across the street and this is the closest restaurant so off I went.\n\nI walked in and the owner or manager met me at the door and asked \"how many\"?\n\nI told him I wanted to order take out and handed me a menu and pointed to the waiting area which was covered in newspapers.  I chose to go to the bar, order a glass of wine, and peruse the menu.\n\nThe drinks are expensive but I didn't think the food was.  Less than $10 for my Mongolian Chicken which came with white sticky rice and a fortune cookie.  When ordering I asked if I could have fried rice instead of white rice but was told \"no\".  Most places allow this for a nominal fee.\n\nFine by me.  Give the white rice.  Food was prepared and their to-go boxes were a lot better than the standard white Chinese \"to go\" boxes.  They also included the plastic-ware, napkin, and soy sauce, which a lot of places forget.\n\nLooking around I found a whole lot of goodness along with a couple disappointments.  Most notably the newspaper strewn about and behind the bar, to the right were a lot of boxes stacked in an unsightly fashion.  I could have been a little more presentable in my opinion.\n\nI peeked into the dining room because I wanted to see if the piano music was piped in or live.  It was live which was very nice. Also, the dinning room looked very nice and cozy.\n\nAs I was leaving the same man who greeted me upon entering made sure to wish me a good evening.  My initial impression of the man was that he was surly and testy but that's just how he comes off.\n\nThe food was very good.  The Mongolian sauce was mixture of sweet with spice and the chicken and vegetables all tasted fresh.","My husband and I went there Saturday, the service was great!  Our friends were going to be late so they told us to start.  And start we did!\nThey were serving Dim Sum, something we had never tried, so glad we did, it was wonderful, hubby wouldn't do the chicken feet, but I think next time I will, it looked very good.\nOur friends showed up and ordered their food, and ate all of it, they said that usually they take food home, but it was so good they had to eat all of it!\nWe will be going back very soon!","Let's see, over 50... check \nold white man...........check \neats dinner ...............check \nlistens to the piano  check \n\nwow this must be the place for me, I mean after all it is in a Chinese mall, no make that a Chinese Cultural Center. How could I possibly have discerning taste with such trickery to get me here to eat. \nDude if you are going to rate a restaurant no need to degrade others with your arrogance. \nFool is my review of wanugee N. \n\nNow on the restaurant. The last time we were here the food was not good, the piano was too loud and the waitress had a real attitude. IT won't keep me from going back as I have had good meals and wait service too. \n\nBack to wanugee N. I do not expect any place in Phx. to have authentic Chinese food, by that I mean the street food one finds in China. \nBut I do expect what I fork in to my mouth is worth what I am going to fork over in cost. Even an old white guy like me can tell the difference between good and bad food. No matter what it is called.","Okay so Ive been glum the past few days as I have an impending birthday. Every year this time I get all down in the dumps.. not that I'm not happy with my life cause life is good. Its more like getting further away from my youth and closer to being well, old. All of my grandparents were crotchety, sourpuss drama queens.. is that my fate? Can I break the mold or am I to going to be a crotchety sourpuss?\n\nSo as I contemplate and figure out what I'm going to do with my birthday baggage I decide to squash it with food. All weekend Ive been eating out and having a good time. This is one of the few times outside of a vacation where I will live it completely and to the near of sheer gluttony. So why not dim sum? \n\nIve chowed much dim sum in my 36 years of earthen wear.. of course some good and some bad. I have never been to a place where every dish was great.. Golden Buddha is no exception to this.. they do the basics well enough and have enough funky cool Asian style to keep me interested in returning. The carts around 1130 flow well but around noon it' s full blown freeway action! In fact there might be some road kill in there based on some of the looks on that last steam cart.. \n\nMe and 3 others who were feeling my pain ordered 14, count them, 14 different dishes. One of my friends is from Georgia and had never had dim sum but he is so courageous and unflinching that he was just a blast. Just the shot in the arm to get me out of my funk. I remember the first time I had dim sum.. my eyes wide open, nostrils flared and excited to see what was under the next steamer lid. That was him today.. one exciting thing after the next.. he was even willing to try chicken feet but this is one of those dishes not done very well here. \n\nMy friend took me back to a time where I was younger and less experienced. He looked up to me to guide him through the noodles, bao and sui mai.. like a big brother.. I'm privileged that I could show him something new and exciting and he was so into it! So instead of feeling sorry for myself I felt experienced and useful.. that there is something I can give back to others.. that its not all about me and me aging but about what can be shared with others.\n\nThere is so much more to do, give and feel in this short time we are here.. and Ill do it to, one bite at a time.","The best to be found in land locked Arizona.  My favorite sticky rice is here.  They have dim sum every day, but not a huge selection, though you can order off the menu.  I think it is much bigger on the weekends.  I'm just happy I can get my fix 7 days a week.  Beautiful gardens to walk through, with fish ponds, and a 99 market next door!","I ate at Golden Buddha a few weeks ago.  We ate at the restaurant after a day at the zoo with our 4 year old and had a blast.  The piano bar played tunes for my daughter and the staff was more than accommodating.  The general tso chicken was better than anything I can get in Tucson.  The soup was chocked full of fresh, read FRESH, not canned, vegetables.  All in all, I was very satisfied with the meal and the service.  Plus the decor is very nice, clean and cheery. \n\nEat at Golden Buddha.","For those who gave this place low marks, forgive me. I really like this place. Now I haven't tried various dim sum places so I'm reserving the right to downgrade the place as needed. The variety of food is plentiful, and the carts just keep on coming. I love the steamed pork buns, and the shiu mai (not sure if I spelled that correctly). Yesterday, my favorite pick was the deep fried rolls of taro and shrimp. YUM! I have never ordered from their menu so I can only talk about their dim sum. My friends and I try to go eat dim sum almost every Sunday. It's a cheap way to try new foods, and if you don't like it, well.. you can get away with pushing it aside with minimal guilt. Give it a try! You might be surprised.","I like Golden Buddha, have taken many friends there for Dim Sum.  \nTry not to \"hit\" the dumpling cart to heavy; otherwise cannot finish it to the dessert cart (LOL).\nLove the jasmine tea and the staff willing to help you if you do not understand the what each item is.\nSingapore Rice Noodles a favorite, along with any of the shrimp dumplings; also the broccoli and green beans.\nOnly wish that the carts with eggplant stuffed with shrimp or green peppers with shrimp were not on \"heated\" carts; by the time it gets to you the food is cold.\nOnly concern is that went on 22MAY2010 at 1:30PM; there was a closed sign due to electricity???\nREVISED: 26MAY2010 - called this evening - looks like they are back open again.","I've been to the Golden Buddha on several occasions and it is my favorite, by far, for honest Chinese food. \nWhile I've sampled everything from their vegetarian to their beef, I love their mandarin chicken. More recently, I was delighted to relive the wonders of their Kung Pao Chicken and Beef with Broccoli. \nI absolutely love the egg drop soup and mini crab rangoons that come with the meal.","The very first time I went to Golden Buddha was with my BFF and it was our first dim sum experience. Little did I know this would forever change my life and eating experiences. Although I must admit that first time was a bit awkward.\n\nGB wisely takes reservations which was wonderful (even though it wasn't crazy busy). Our assorted dim sum plates were flavorful and fresh. And the carts seemed to be in constant rotation so we were never too far from a good selection.\n\nWhat really helps GB is its location. The Cofco Center is an experience in itself, where one can have herbs specially blended, select a fresh member of marine life to take home and cook or browse through a store with one of the largest selections of Buddhas and hand fans I've experienced outside of San Francisco.","I've been to Golden Buddha a few times and have not been disappointed. \n\nThey have a LARGE selection of Dim Sum and if you're not careful you can get carried away.\n\nTry and get there early and you'll get the best and most fresh selection.\nMake sure you walk around the garden when you're done.","Probably the most comprehensive Chinese menu in the Valley.  Pick from well over 100 dishes, but if you want the best order the Peking Duck.  Everything else is very good, but without a wow factor.  You'll see lots of Chinese people in this massive restaurant, which probably means they're doing a fine job in the kitchen.","I very much enjoyed eating here. Food was great. Fairly fast service. Wasn't expensive either for the 4 of us.","Golden Buddha has GREAT dim sum.  Their prices are reasonable and the staff is very polite wheeling their little carts.  I tend to go on the weekend because there is more selection but they do dim sum throughout the week.  They also have some very authentic dishes on the menu for those who are more of the adventurous types.  Be sure to say hello to the turtles the next time you go.","This place in the Chinese Cultural Center has a very pretty and elegant bar area. I was pleased to learn that they had some very reasonable and delicious happy hour snacks. This is a good place for a Pina Colada. I had one by myself along with some dumplings and fried shrimp appetizer. Sadly I never brought anyone else here with me. It was happy hour heaven but you know? A lot of my friends in AZ pretty much hang out in one neighborhood or another and nobody I know really lives close to the Buddha.\nThe airport is pretty close by. This might be a good pre-flight send-off location.","I have had dim sum in New Orleans and Phoenix (not SF), and this is about equal to the best of New Orleans as far as flavor.\nAs for ambiance, today was a good day. I've had dim sum here about a dozen times, and have had very good service and quality 90% of the time, including weekends. I have had bad days here, but since today was good, I'll rate accordingly. It's closer to a 4.5, but since I can't give half-stars, I rounded up.\nDon't expect me to give these the right names, but... I was less than impressed with the bbq pork balls. They tasted too much like honey and the beef was minimal. The bbq sauce tasted bottled. Outside of that, their herbal hot tea is delicious even on a hot day.\nThe shu mai were very good, and the shrimp in a spinach dumpling was fantastic. A definite don't miss is their sticky rice in lotus leaf. It's among the best I've had anywhere. Just be careful; you'll find bones in it every once in a while. Go for any of their steamed dumplings; they're very flavorful. As others have said, I love the Chinese broccoli, but you'll only find it on the carts on weekends. Otherwise order it off the menu.\nToday (11:30 lunch) the carts came around often, and everything except the pork buns was piping hot and fresh. By the way, despite the price increases, even the sticky rice was considered a medium size entree, and the two of us eating there escaped with a bill under $20 and we were done in under 30 minutes.\nI strongly recommend the dim sum here, whether you've had it a million times or have never had it before. You usually won't be disappointed.","I don't really understand the poor reviews on this place.....maybe it depends on the day you go? We went on a Sunday, it was crazy busy, but service was great! (of course, my view of customer service is a little different then the rest... I used to live on an island where you were just happy to find what you were looking for, let alone expect good customer service) Anyways, our server was very sweet! Always had a smile on her face. The carts served us promplty and none of the food was cold. They always had whatever we wanted (I hate having to wait for the next cart).\n\nNow, as for the actual dim sum and food.......holy cow, to die for! So flavorful and fresh!! The broccoli makes you sing...and the wine noodles, make you cry. You leave with very weird mixed emotions, but mostly a happy belly full of yummy food.\n\nIn my opinion, this is the best dim sum I have been able to find in Phx. I'm ditching my previous spot (Mekong Palace) and will be back to Golden Buddha when the dim sum monster strikes again!"],"type":["Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low

I had a horrible experience.  Vowed never to go back!  At that time, I even had a terrible interaction with the owner.\n\nThis time I was invited with a couple of girlfriends because they love it. Decided to try again since it was more about the \"get together\" than the food/location.\n\nThis time, overpriced food and bad service.  Overall, it was not anything out of the ordinary and not worth the price.   I had the veal speciality.   Large portion, but ok.  Staff was not very attentive for the small amount of customers present.\n\nI am a Pittsburgh native.  This is a bad neighborhood. \n\nI am NOT interested in ever going back!","No better in taste than a Fazoli or even an Olive Garden.  Inflated prices, like the cheapest entree was $40, try to disguise this place as something it is not.  Went with a group of co workers, so we pretty much got everything on the menu and not one thing stuck out really good.  Service is incredibly slow.  Not worth it at all.  Even if you tell yourself that atleast the portions are large, the food is just not good enough to warrant wasting a meal eating there.","The menu online gives no prices, and the entrees are ridiculously overpriced for what you get - a good meal, but far too much food, and nothing extraordinary. The entrees are $50 - $60. BE WARNED - if you want atmosphere to go with your $60 entree, you'd better REQUEST DOWNSTAIRS! Otherwise you can have your anniversary dinner in a small room in front of large televisions. Who knew? And the staff will definitely not accommodate your request for a more romantic spot - even if they know it is your tenth anniversary! Wow. Should have walked out.","I do not say this with many 2 star ratings but I would like to go back for another try.  The reason is simple, in reading the reviews below, I have to assume we hit Alla Famigilia on a bad night, at least I hope so.  The main reason for the low rating was the service.  We were seated on the third floor which is their bar area, at a high top table and the bar tender was our server.  She had to mix drinks for every table on the third floor, tend to the patrons at the bar and come around to wait on our table.  That was not fair to her and definitely not fair to us.  Her service and attentiveness lacked for obvious reasons but even when she was \"free\" she walked by our table without a glance and was apparently hard of hearing.  Furthermore, when ever one person got her attention for another drink or something, she said okay and left, without giving anyone else a chance to order.  The rest of the staff tried to pick up the slack a little but they were jammed as well.  Sounds weird, but I never felt so rushed in a 3 hour dinner.  The food took awhile, which is fine and expected on a busy Saturday night, just keep the drinks flowing and stop by once in a awhile so we don't notice.\n\nI also did not like that we were seated at a high top table.  I love the high tops for drinks and a few apps but for a 3 hour meal, these were uncomfortable, especially if your legs didn't hit the chair cross bars correctly (either too short or too tall).\n\nThe food was good, very good in some instances and disappointing in one.  I loved the pasta with Vodka sauce and the salad, both part of the entree which is unusual for a high end restaurant.  The meatball appetizer and the calamari and shrimp appetizer were the best things I ate all evening.  The biggest disappointment was the veal chop.  I love a good bone in veal chop but was leaning towards a seafood dish. I ended up changing my mind right before I ordered as I saw the veal chop brought out to another table and it looked amazing.  The disappointment was it was over-cooked.  It came out medium well at best (closer to well) and for $68, and for the amount they were serving that night, they should know how to cook them to perfection.  Not a spot of pink to be found.  No one even asked us during our meal if everything was okay or any issues.  When most of the chop remained on my plate and everyone else's entree was 90% eaten, not even a \"was everything okay\".  Just clear me out and get on with the next one.\n\nI hope to have the opportunity to go back and I will not be seated in the third floor bar area and I will not get my same waitress and give it another try.  I expected so much more.","We had the mushrooms, meatball appetizer, pasta, salad, veal piccata and spaghetti with clam sauce. A nice pasta dish with roasted veggies and marinara was made as a special order. But I was not wowed by this restaurant. Large portions are not enough to impress me. The tastes were good, but for the prices, I'd expect better. If you're a big meat eater, or love to eat huge amounts of pasta, ok, this is great. But the sauces were just ok, nothing spectacular. Spaghetti with clams was covered with red pepper flakes but not noted as such on the menu. Would you like someone to cover your pizza slice with red pepper flakes without asking? I'm sure the deserts are good but we didn't have any - but the sizes of the appetizers and entrees is just over the top, but not worth the premium prices to me.","The food was delicious. But it is a ridiculously expensive restaurant. If you're intimidated by spending $100 or more on a complete meal for 1 person, then this is not the place for you. Knowing that we had other plans for our evening, my date and I cut the meal short with appetizers, salad, and a bottle of one of the lesser expensive wines they offer, which was $54 a bottle. Our check was still $120, and we left hungry. Which is a shame, because the little of what we did have, we fully enjoyed. There are plenty of Italian restaurants in Pittsburgh, and many of them are very, very good - where one can enjoy a meal for a fraction of what it costs here.","This used to be my secret place, but I've told so many people about it that I have a hard time getting a reservation.  I've known Jonathan (chef/owner) for a few years and he's done some good improvements.  He's added a bar upstairs which is very cool and they also have a patio that's great.  I had a dinner party there in the summer and have another one planned in March and Jonathan totally goes the extra effort to make it special.  He arranged for a dj last time, so we were able to dance off some of his food.  Okay, the food is great.  I especially recommend the Veal Chop.  The staff is awesome. I really like Marney and Errol (two main servers) and I like Jordan the bartender upstairs (Marney's daughter).  I'd like to give this place 5 stars, but it has a few smaller problems.  It's a little bit pricey.  The good is that the cost does include salad, pasta, and bread, but the bad is that you'll easily spend $50 on an entree.  The Veal Chop is $65.  That's a little much, especially considering the location.  The dishes also which are delicious are simply toooooo big.  I mean literally you can three meals out of one entree,  I would suggest some smaller plates especially for the bar.  One last tip, even though it's not BYOB anymore, you can still BYOB.  He won't turn you away.  This is one of my favorite restaurants.  The chef is really talented and I'd hazard a guess that if he was in New York he could be a celebrity chef if he wanted.  He's got the personality.","The food is unforgettable, but unfortunately so is the bill.  Sicilian themed with fresh ingredients in an intimate setting all prepared in an open kitchen.\n\nAsk before you order a special, or you might be stunned when you are handed the check. But if you love food and money is no object, this is your place. A great place for Valentine's day or a special anniversary splurge, with the emphasis on the word 'splurge'.","Old school Italian. Enough said. This place sets the standard for great Italian food.\nThe meatballs are a muct have and the pastas are incredible.\nI had a veal chop with long hots. It just doesn't get any better.\nAnd don't miss the tiramisu. As good as it gets.","First, the Veal Milanese is easily the best veal chop I've had anywhere. Ever. And I've had plenty of veal.  Second, the veal chop is definitely in my top 5 favorite dishes I've ever had, ever. \n\nFantastic restaurant. The relatively new chef has made this place even better than it was. This is THE most underrated restaurant on Yelp in Pittsburgh. Great service, extremely friendly staff, fantastic atmosphere.\n\nBe sure to come hungry. You cannot leave unsatisfied. Meals typically last me 3-4 hours, but I take my time. BYOB is a bonus too. \n\nIn summary, Alla Famiglia is consistently the best restaurant in Pittsburgh. Try it if you have not, and you won't be disappointed.","I have been frequenting Alla Famiglia since 2007 and it is still my favorite Italian restaurant in Pittsburgh and perhaps my favorite in the world!  \n\nChef Jonathan is a genius - his \"Veal Chop Milanese\" with lump crab, toasted pine nuts, and lemon is the BEST I've ever had.  Every time we eat here, my husband orders this dish and refuses to try anything else - that's how AMAZING it is.  \n\nI have tried a variety of entrees - everything from the the Veal Chop Pizzaiolo to the Steak il pizzaiolo to the Medallions of veal Pomodoro ai Pepperoni.  Each dish is infused with deliciousness that makes these entrees OUT OF THIS WORLD!  \n\nYou have got to try the following:  mozzarella (apptz), hot peppers (apptz), mozzarella stuffed meatball (apptz), vodka pasta (automatically received with your meal - sauce is delicious), veal chop milanese (entr\u00e9e).  \n\nYou won't be disappointed - the kitchen is open so you can even watch as Chef Jonathan prepares your dinner.  \n\nMake a reservation.  Neighborhood is a bit sketchy so be careful.  \n\nPS.  I've taken all my friends, family, and business partners (many who do not live in Pittsburgh) here and everyone absolutely loves it and wishes they lived in Pitt so they could come here more often.  In fact, we no longer live in Pittsburgh, but every time we come into town for a visit, we HAVE to eat dinner at our favorite Alla Famiglia!","This is my second review of Alla Famalgia and again this place gets five stars. I loved every part of my meal. I started out with the twelve ounce stuffed meatball and the truffled mushroom appetizers. The waiter invited me to watch as the mushrooms were being prepared at the kitchen counter. There I chatted with the chef as he prepared my app. Explaining as he went on, first slicing fresh chantrel, portobellos, and button mushrooms. Next he saut\u00e9 them in olive oil, added brown sugar, brandy, raisins, and finished it with heavy cream. They were fantastic. There were a variety of specials including wild boar chops, a risotto with prawns, scallops, and black truffles. But I chose the dry aged filet with lump crab in a leek cream. It was the best piece of filet I've ever had. It was easily a pound of beef and a half pound of crab in a light cream sauce with leeks. I could barely touch it after the pasta, salad, bread, and appetizers. I brought my leftovers home and have them another time. Dessert consisted of a nice portion of carrot cake with an apricot cream cheese icing with apricot jam filling. It was a nice take on an old favorite. For the four of us the bill was over 300 dollars, but well worth it for the attentive service and extremely well prepared food.","Spent the weekend in the city with some friends. This was our first time to Alla Famiglia.  Unbelievable!!!  We enjoyed everything.  If you are looking for high quality food with a great friendly staff, this is it.  It is a little out of the way but it is worth the trip.  If I had the option to give 6 stars I would do it.   Very impressive.","While visiting the Pittsburgh area, my wife and I were intrigued by the excellent reviews we found of Alla Familgia.  While it was a bit of a drive from Cranberry Township, we needed a dining reprieve after a disappointing visit at BRAVO! Cucina Italiana.  East Warrington Avenue is undergoing major construction which made finding parking a bit difficult, fortunately there is valet service in a lot to the side of the restaurant which we took advantage of.  \nUpon entering, we were warmly welcomed by the host.  We visited on a stormy evening and were fortunate to find that some reservations had been cancelled due to the weather, which enabled us to get a table.  I strongly advise to get reservations in advance.  We were seated on the first floor with a view of the chefs cooking.  Awesome.\nAll that has been said in prior reviews, I heartily agree with.  The bread, cheese, and dipping oil was a delicious start.  Ingredients were fresh.  The pasta and main course dishes were done perfectly.  My wife had the Gorgonzola Filet Mignon, which she described as one of the best meals she has ever eaten.\nWhen we are in the area, we'll be back.","I was in Pittsburgh (my hometown) for a visit from Boston.  I was so pleased with the meal at this restaurant.  It was by far the best restaurant I have ever been to in the Burgh.  The wait staff, chef, food, was stellar.  We are known for very good restaurants in Boston and this restaurant could be in Boston or NYC it is that fantastic!  I would highly recommend going here if you have a special occasion, date night, or just want a superb meal.","FACT: Thee best Italian meal I've had in the Burgh, hands down!\nFACT: I ate so much I thought they would have to wheel me out on a stretcher.\nFACT: It's a serious hidden gem in a slightly sketchy neighborhood.\n\nNeed some more info, because I'm comin' atcha with the goods! To start they set the table with \"Holy Oil,\" which is banana pepper olive oil for dipping Italian bread in, a seasoned cecci bean and cheese gustoso and a goat cheese and olive spread. I wish they sold that banana pepper olive oil because I wanted to have it every day of my life! \n\nWe ordered the famous Meatball appetizer. This meatball is for serious! It's massive and stuffed with mozzarella cheese. Yep, I'm for realz. It was just oozing Italian sexiness, in a ball. As soon as I tasted the red sauce, it tasted like my Grandma's, which sparked fond memories and made me want to actually live in this place. \n\nWe also ordered the Trifolata, which is assorted mushrooms and currants in marsala cream. It was also incredible. The bad/good of it was that it wasn't really needed because they give you so much food, but it was delicious, so whatever!\n\nFor the Third course they serve you your choice of pasta either with their famous home made vodka sauce or fettucini. But here's the thing, the fettucini is made in front of you... in a cheese wheel. Yep, I'm for realz again! I know I'm crazy for not ordering it, but I really love me some vodka sauce and was incredibly happy with this amazing homemade sauce. My hubby got the fetticini and loved it. See, we're all happy here!\n\nFourth course is a salad with red vinagariette, roasted red peppers, candied walnuts, golden raisens and gargonzola cheese. It wasn't memorable amongst all the bangin' dishes but not too shabby at all.\n\nFor the Fifth course (and when I finally tapped out) I ordered the Cioppino with shrimp, mussels, clams, scallops and fish in a saffron and tomato broth with sambuca. It matched all the other dishes. Just incredible. Loved the broth, loved the succulent scallop (just one, but I can't complain, I was stuffed by that point!), the shrimp was jumbo and the fish was perfectly cooked. And the garlic bread was excellent.\n\nWhenever anyone says things are expensive, I usually think they're talking $30 a plate. But, this place is legit expensive. Think $50 (ish) a plate. But what I can tell you is it was 100% worth it! We had leftovers for two days! Talk about an Italian hospitality. Which, by the way, the service was exceptional, but I would have expected that here. \n\nA perfect special night out, if you don't mind unbuckling a couple notches in front of your dining companion, of course!","Absolutely incredible restaurant! It is by far my favorite restaurant in the city. Everything about this place is fantastic especially their Veal Chop Milanese, the restaurant is pretty pricey but 100% well worth the money. I recommend this restaurant to anyone who is looking for a fantastic Italian meal.","This is my favorite place to eat!  The greens and beans, the meatball, and the hot cheese for appetizers are excellent.  I love the pasta with a dash of the oil they give you. The Alfredo in the cheese wheel is an excellent alternative to red sauce.   I've tried just about every dish there and never had a bad meal.  The Veal Chop is by far my favorite.  Huge portions which usually come home!! ;)\nThe atmosphere is a very quaint three story house, use valet parking, because the area is not the best! Lol but the police station is a cross the street. So it's all good!   \nThis is the perfect place for a great meal with great service for any function or just date night!","Possibly the best Italian Restaurant I've ever been too.  The Vodka Sauce was phenomenal.  I finished the evening with a  Fernet Branca.....perfection.","This is one of if not the best meals I have ever had.   I have only gone as part of work functions (about 3 different occasions) and every time we get the upstairs private room.  The service is fantastic.  I always have the Veal Chop Milanese which is AMAZING.  They also have a delicious pasta as an appetizer which has a little spice to it.  You will not find a better meal in Pittsburgh.  I have no idea what the prices actually are as I have never paid but it is definitely very pricey.  The neighborhood is real grimey but don't let that dissuade you from going there.","Their prices are exorbitant but so worth it. I've only had Italian this good in NY, LA, and Italy. No wonder there are pictures of celebrities all over the walls. What a hidden gem. $260 for two? Money well spent.","UPDATED: Just wanted to share that we attempted to visit for a third time when my husband's brother was in town in mid-November of 2014.  We had reservations for 7:30 on a Tuesday, so we obviously figured we would be seated immediately.  The brother and his girlfriend arrived a couple minutes before the reservation and were told to go up to the bar while they set the table and wait for the rest of the party.  I arrived about a minute after and my husband a few minutes behind me as he needed to park due to the lack of valet during the week.  There was no one at the host stand when either of us came in.  So we went up to the bar, declined a drink... and waited, and waited.  The bartender soon became deeply involved in picking a wine for a couple at the bar, not his fault.  The brother eventually was able to flag down a waitress to ask if she could check on our table.  She looked very annoyed.  She eventually went over to the phone at the bar, called down, hung up the phone and said, dead pan, \"no, it's not ready yet.\"  Not a smile, not a sorry, not a \"can we get you a drink on the house?\" Meanwhile, there was an open table for 4 on that floor.  The bartender eventually told us \"that's for a reservation.\" \"Yes, we have a reservation... for 25 minutes ago.\"  \"They must have specifically requested that table.\"  They did, however, offer us the table right next to the door on the first floor though - the one with the 10 degree breeze coming in that night.  No thank you.  We were very insulted by the lack of table for our reservation, but more so by the lack of acceptable service.  We decided to leave and spend $20 on pizza instead of $100+ per person and enjoyed much better service.. which is never the way it should be.  Hopefully they solve this problem soon.  We'll give it one more go when the insult has worn off.\n\nMy husband won't hesitate to tell you what his favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh is: Alla Famiglia.  And to be honest, these days I agree with him!  \n\nWhile my husband enjoys many of the more \"up and coming\" restaurants with smaller portions and interesting flavor combinations, he often finds himself longing for the same quality food with better cuts of meat and bigger portions.  This is where we satisfy both of our appetites for big flavor and, well, big portions.  But to reduce Alla Famiglia to those two things alone would not do it justice.\n\nLet's start out instead with addressing the two biggest critiques of this place: its location and the price.  Yes, it is in Allentown, but they also have plenty of parking and valet if you prefer.  Honestly, we drive almost everywhere to get dinner, so this is not an issue for us.  The other thing I always hear about is how expensive it is.  Some of those complaints come from people who I know have no problem giving their money to the big steakhouse chains, while getting a lot less value.  No, it is not cheap.  You will likely pay upwards of $50 for your entry.  The veal chops are close to $70.  But, that's not all you get.  You get delicious, fresh baked bread, a spread, dipping oil and gustoso for same, a delicious salad, and homemade pasta served family style.  If you wanted to be especially frugal, you could approach this place like an Olive Garden senior special: feast on the freebies and take your entree to go.  But, even if you're full, it may be too difficult not to savor the meal as it comes out...\n\nI've been here twice and my husband has been here three times (lucky - he got to go for work and he said they ordered almost every appetizer, all of which were apparently delicious).  The first time I ordered the filet with gorgonzola.  It was one of the most delicious and largest filets I've ever had.  My husband ordered a veal chop with prosciutto which I don't think I recognized on the current menu, but he absolutely loved it.  The veal chop is one of the largest bone-in cuts of meat I've seen and the sear on it was absolutely perfect.  We also ordered the mussels, which were spicy and delicious, and the meatball appetizer, which I remember being tasty, but nothing too out of the ordinary.  I think there are other things on the menu to try first. \n\nThe second time we came I ordered the Milanese veal chop, breaded, slightly citrusy, and absolutely heavenly.    He had the cowboy ribeye which was also large and an absolutely beautiful cut of meat.  The husband has a thing about fatty cuts and avoiding anything that is the least bit chewy, and he barely had to leave a piece on his plate.  We also got the calamari appetizer, which was perfectly, lightly fried with a savory, garlic sauce that sets it apart from the sweet sauces often served with calamari.\n\nFinally, I should note that the service we have received here has always been exceptional.  Everyone is always professional and courteous.","After a friend told me about her wonderful experience here, I knew I had to go. I also knew that it wasn't really in my budget. Well, lucky for me an old college friend of mine decided that he was coming to town for a visit. I sent him the websites for various restaurants and when he saw Alla Famiglia he said, \"Oh honey. Make the reservation - I've got it.\"  YES! I knew I kept him around for some reason!\n\nSo on a cold, snowy Saturday night, we trudged up the mountain. And it was glorious.\n\nFirst off, it IS in a bit of a sketchy neighborhood. But no worries - they have valet, so you don't have to deal with trying to find somewhere to park and walking around.\n\nThe Holy Oil is the best thing I've ever dipped bread into - and I'm a dipper. I come from an Italian family - we dip everything into everything - bread into sauce, cookies into coffee, bread into coffee, etc. This is by far the best dipping experience I've ever had.\n\nOnto the MEATBALL. We got the mozzarella-stuffed meatball for our appetizer. The meatball was good. The sauce was great. There isn't much more I can say about it, to be honest. It was just so, so yummy.\n\nSalad course: Great salad!\n\nPasta course: So, I was slightly disappointed that they did not give us a choice. I was really looking forward to the fettuccine in the cheese wheel that I had read about here! Alas, only vodka sauce. Great vodka sauce, though. I should've asked about that damn cheese wheel...\n\nFor the main course, I got the veal chop milanese and it was perfect. My friend got the cioppino and he enjoyed that very much.\n\nI could not even think about eating dessert. We had so much food. I took 1/2 of my pasta course and 3/4 of my main course home. I really wish I had gotten a dessert to go and eaten it later, though. \n\nI really cannot wait to go again.","I was in Pittsburgh my home town for a recent stay.  Alla Famiglia is the best restaurant I have been to in the Burgh.  It was consistent with the type of upscale dining I have gotten used to in Boston and I was pleasantly surprised.  The area surrounding the restaurant does not seem to be the safest locale, but worth going there for a wonderful dinner.  The service was exceptional!  The food was amazing with cheese plates, bread and side for the bread basket, meatball appetizer, cowboy steak with gorgonzola, and the halibut.  The tiramisu was the best I have had.  The addition of BYOB was a hidden gem as well.  I would highly recommend this for a special night out to celebrate.  Fantastic restaurant.","Simply outstanding...we had a large group (11) and everything was perfect. Several comments that this was the best Italian cuisine several of our group had experienced anywhere in the world.  Can't wait to go back!\n\nThe famous Meatball app did not disappoint (my fav was the stuffed peppers) and the many preparations of veal (main courses) were all exquisite.  \n\nAbsolutely recommend for any and all who are considering this fantastic establishment!","Just recently returned. PHENOMENAL meal! Glenn our waiter was superb. Loved the veal dishes.  I also enjoyed the new cocktail menu. One of the drinks was iced coffee with orangicello and frangelica cream. DELICIOUS!","This restaurant was phenomenal.   We went for my wife's 30th birthday with a large group of people and it was a great experience.  \n\nThe meatball and fried cheese appetizers were really good.  The marinara that came with the meatball was the best I have ever had.\n\nDon't go here if you are in a rush, because the entire dining experience will take several hours.  But we were there to enjoy the night, so we did not care.\n\nI would definitely recommend this to anyone as long as you are willing to spend the money.  If you do  appetizers, drinks and dinner it will run about $100 a person.  But I thought it was well worth it.\n\nThe wait staff was great.  Our server was Emmett and we had a lot of fun with him.  The owner/chef even came out and chatted with us on the upstairs outdoor patio.","My favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. Always delicious and I always order a different entree.

waiter was to be found about ten minutes later they gave us our water and left again! It wasn't even busy! There were only TWO dim sum carts floating around somewhere. Then our waiter finally came around and took our orders of lunch entrees. The food was not even that good as the reviews that are posted on here. When we came up to pay, the bill was super overpriced. I will not be returning here, I am better off eating at Great Wall Cuisine.","If this place had zero stars I would have given them that ! Let me start off by saying I was so excited to read all great reviews so maybe I just came in on a off day? We walked in and were seated came over and asked if we wanted water or tea I guess they don't serve anything Else, Then we placed an order pork dumplings and sticky rice nasty! Then I asked if they served egg rolls they said they were out!!! they pushed their little carts around with hot plates that basically steam the food and is not fresh and what you get is soggy poor customer service we had to get up and look for someone to give us our tab so we could get the heck out of there are get some real food. It looked like it would be a great place for groups of people would not recommend if you are on mission for what you want and want to place an order but it could be a fun experience for some people.","You walk into a Chinese restaurant on a Saturday afternoon for dim sum and you expect the place to be PACKED.  Well, walking in to a pretty much empty dining room, it's a VERY CLEAR SIGN.  But my friend insisted and I was very hesitant for good reasons.  Another indicator, the majority of the patrons were NON Asian.  \n\nFood: You walk in and you see carts of the food by the entrance to the dining room.  Umm, I thought dim sum should come right off the steamer and into the carts and they roll it around, not sitting around.  The dim sum was garbage.  It had the typical selection, but at minimum.  \n\nService: It's ok.  But it doesn't make up for the horrible food.\n\nBottom line: NO WAY!  Stay away!","I've been here many times...Mother's Day with family, dim sum with book club, etc. But I will not go back again.  I stopped in to ask the owner about a donation or reduced price for a class of under-privileged kids that I volunteer with.  His reaction was to scoff and shoo me out the door while handing me his card and saying I could email him.  He turned his back and headed off to the messy newspaper-strewn table he haunts between guests arrivals.  Maybe he's a community-minded business owner, but then again, maybe he's not.  I'll be dining elsewhere.","Being from Chicago, we are used to getting authentic Chinese food all the time.  But when we first starting spending a lot of time in Scottsdale/Phoenix, we found it a challenge to get authentic Chinese food.  We were excited to find the Golden Buddha and have made many trips over the years all the way from the Troon North area to get our fix.  However, service has declined to the point where it is no longer worth the aggravation.  We went there last night for Chinese New Year and will never go back.  Granted they were very busy because of a lot of large tables there, but waiting almost an hour to get our food is not acceptable under any circumstance!  45 mins. into our wait, the waitress came back (after we flagged her down to ask about our food) and said one of the dishes we ordered was not available....after 45 mins.!!!! What makes the whole experience an unforgivable one is that the manager/owner is so indifferent and never apologized or offered a discount off the bill...nothing.  When we left, the same manager was at the piano singing in Chinese. Huh?  Other than Nee House in Scottsdale, the search goes on for a restaurant that serves authentic Chinese food closer to home.","I will NEVER go there again.  I reserved a table for a group of 16 people for 5:00 PM on Christmas Eve .  The person on the phone ( I believe the manager) repeatedly asked me to call ahead and give him an accurate head count since he said they'd be swamped that day.  I followed up with him twice.  \nWhen the first couple of us arrived, we had menus shoved in our faces immediately and told we \"Must order now.  Must order now\" because they were going to be busy later on.  The place was practically empty.  As each person arrived, they were treated the same way. \nWe rushed and placed our orders and then they brought out our checks WAY before we saw any sign of our food.  I have never in my life been treated so rudely by a restaurant.\nIt was utter chaos when the food started coming out while everyone struggled to get the correct dish they ordered.  One person didn't get her food until we were all just about finished eating. \nOne top of all that, the food wasn't even good.  I've had better Kung Pao Chicken at Panda Express!\nAfter being rushed through our meal, the place wasn't even half full by the time we left.  I thought being at the Cultural Center, this restaurant would be a sure thing but boy was I wrong.  Lovely way to spend Christmas Eve..","If you are looking a chinese restaurant to host a big party look some other than the Golden Buddah.  I recently attended a banquet at the Golden Buddah and I was shocked at the level of quality of food and service.  Of the 10 dishes served 4 were nearly inedible.  \n\nThere was a crab claw appetizer, most chinese restaurants prepare this dish by taking a crab claw surrounding it with ground shrimp, batter and then deep fry.  At Golden Buddah, the crab claw served was mostly batter.  \n\nThe shark fin soup served was mostly broth.  Shark fin is an expensive ingredient and most places usually use imitation shark fin, but come on at least put something in there so that I know I'm eating soup and not dirty sink water.  \n\nGinger scallion lobster is battered, fried, and then stir fried in a sauce with ginger and scallions.  The ginger scallion lobster served was over-cooked and dried out.  \n\nLastly, there was a steamed fish.  The fish was raw in the middle.   \n\nIt wasn't all bad, there was a crispy chicken with garlic dish that was pretty good, but out of 10 dishes 4 were bad, 5 were okay, and 1 was good.  \n\nDoes 4 bad dishes out of 10 warrant a one star rating?  Well it does when you factor in the service.  The soup, appetizer, and first entree arrived timely, but after that there was a 1 hour gap before we received the next dish.  The dishes were not served with accompanying white rice which I thought was odd.  We had to ask for it, and even the rice took a while to arrive.","I agree with Crystal C., that the dim sum isn't the greatest I've ever had. In fact, I am not sure if the meal was so tasty that it was memorable. I do remember the \"calamari\" was not really calamari, like you would think. It was presented more like a sweet and sour pork (so calamari with LOTS of breading) without any sauce. As a result, the dish was dry and salty.\n\nThe sticky rice was good (hard to mess up), the chicken feet were okay (needed more five spice powder), and the shumai was alright. The noodles were good, and I can see why the cart ran out after the first round. The diners were an equal mix of Asians and Americans. I would've preferred to see more Asians eating (as I am used to in a Chinatown and gives an indication of authenticity), but I do realize we're in Phoenix where the Asian population is not like San Francisco or Houston. \n\nThe meal came to about $30 for two, including jasmine tea. The carts are loud because they are made out of metal and roll on tile. I am also not used to staff members shouting what they have in their cart, like a newspaper boy yelling \"Extra! Extra!\" Christmas music was playing after mid-January, so the atmosphere felt strange. Next time I visit the city, I probably will pass.","Can't say that I was very impressed. Came for dinner in a hopeful and enthusiastic mood since the reviews have been pretty good, but I don't think this place lives up to its current good, but declining rating.\n\nOrdered the Combo fried rice (shrimp, chicken, beef, pork), sesame chicken, and garlic fried chicken. \n\nThe combo fried rice was pretty good, but ended up drinking about 6 glasses of water due to the MSG and sodium content. You'd think that the cook spent his better years in the French Foreign Legion in the Sahara eating salt tablets and developed a taste for them. \n\nThe sesame chicken had a good flavor and a thick brown sweet sauce. I liked it a lot until it got cool and the sauce looked (with that stringy consistency) more like glue. You think I'm kidding? I'm not.\n\nGarlic fried chicken was bad. Just bad. It was like an over roasted dried out half chicken with some dried garlic pieces sprinkled on top. No spices, no flavor, no good. \n\nWe then got all kinds of lip from the waitress when we asked if they could change the channel on the TV from college football, to the Suns game. They made it into this big deal that the \"customers\" wanted to see the football game. Yeah right, it was University of West Virginia Vs. University of Connecticut! I would have believed it if it was a local team....\n\nIt's better than a 1 star joint, but only because it's borderline edible. To be avoided.","This restaurant is located in the Chinese Cultural Center and was the one restaurant that I had not been to. So after some shopping at one of the shops, we stepped in to have dinner.\n\nWe stepped in and asked for a seat for two. We were seated immediately. The place was decorated nicely and a lady playing the piano made for great ambiance.\n\nWe looked at the menu briefly and ordered our drinks, an appetizer, a soup and two main dishes. The drinks came out promptly and so did the rest of the meal. My goodness everything we ordered was very tasty.\n\nThe waiter service itself however was not even close to the decor and food. He never introduced himself, and although he took our order, our food itself was brought out by a kitchen person.\n\nAfter we ordered our waiter really never came back asking if we needed anything else, except to give us our check at the end and that was after the person I was dining with got up and asked a different waiter for it.\n\nIt's amazing how a place with great food, decor, and ambiance can mess it all up by crappy waiter service.","I love Dim Sum, my favorite Chinese dish.\n\nWhen Golden Buddha first open, they have excellent Dim sum. I went there many times, I tell my friend how good it is, But now,  they change cook, taste more like  week old left over. Rumor has it, they change cook every few month, so Quality of cooking change. (not sure if that is true, but that is what I was told.)\nMy advice is; when you walk in the door and the place is pack, = Good Cook. if the place is bare = bad cook. leave immediately. don't waste your money.","If you just \"want\" dim sum, go here. If you are \"craving\" dim sum, go elsewhere (take a 5 hour drive west to neighboring state, California).\n\nAnyway, I've been visiting Golden Buddha in the noontime for roughly 2 years now. I believe they moved from their original site (7th St. & Osborn), formerly \"China Doll.\" Relocation brought along better atmosphere and smiling faces. This does not mean, better dim sum. But since we are in Phoenix, I will settle for what they have to offer. \n\nBe mindful of the dim sum tab. It's itemized high-medium-low. \n\nShaomai can be found as combinations of pork/mushroom, shrimp, or shark fin (which should not be confused as true shark bits, as the shaomai is prepared to look like a shark's fin). These picks are okay...perhaps on a better day shao mai will be served in less-rigid, or fresher wrappers. Potstickers are okay as well, just the usual scallion and pork, and dry wrapper. The baby pork ribs in light black bean sauce and jalapenos is alright, but sometimes lacks in taste. Tripe is also served in its bare minimum...so if you enjoy the texture and flavor of tripe, try this with its clear sauce and thinly sliced carrots and celery.  \nBuche (that's what I call it), or fried sesame balls are also available, although if you wait until dessert, they will also be a bit stiff. There are a few other things that may be \"spotted\" but are not worth mentioning. \n\nDon't order from their lunch menu, as you can find these over-salted dishes at Panda Express anyway. \n\nOverall, dim sum at Golden Buddha is a place to go if you are around the vicinity and feel like having something apart from the usual fast food. However, discriminating palates- beware.","Not impressed with this place at all. This was not the friendliest place around, maybe because of the language barrier (most or all were clearly native Chinese speakers), or maybe just the attitude of the employees.\n\nI ordered the sweet and sour chicken lunch, which came with the typical egg drop soup, crab rangoon, and egg roll. The soup was ok - maybe it's just me, but I prefer a real spoon to the scoop that they gave me. The egg roll was tiny and not that great, and the crab rangoon was ok, but maybe a little undercooked. The chicken wasn't bad, but nothing special, as was the rice and other stuff on the plate.\n\nOverall, this was just not my kind of Chinese place.","Disappointing.  Mediocre at best.  I am staying at the Aloft hotel in phoenix and ordered some delivery. I ordered a couple american chinese food staples: general tso's chicken, dumplings and hot&sour soup.  Soup had zero flavor, dumplings tasted freezer burned and processed.  General tso chicken was ehh. \n\nA lot of good reviews on here so it must be for eat in and for their dim sum.  Don't order delivery, you will be left hungry and unsatisfied.","Went there on Saturday for early lunch.  My wife did the dim sum, it was okay, we were both disgusted by the sugar cane shrimp; but the rest was good.  \n\nI ordered the chicken szechwuan, the waitress warned me it was \"spicy\" the reason I ordered it.  It came out delicious, but not what I would call spicy.  Overall its hard to find good Chinese in the valley and I would call this good without hesitation.","So I was referred to this place from the front desk of my hotel. I'm from SF so I'm coming from a place with really good chinese food. \n\nThe dim sum is just \"ok\" nothing for me to write home about. The one dish that I really liked was the chinese broccoli cooked with garlic sauce. Yum yum yum.  It's in a big bowl, not oily, not saucy, just really good. I think it's $7.50.  \n\nIt's a somewhat pricey and just like all chinese restaurants, it's not the cleanest.  The chair was filthy.  the dishes weren't all that great.  I wouldn't go back unless I want the chinese broccoli.  \n\nSo I went on a Sunday and it was not crowded at all. There's not a huge asian population  in Phoenix (not that I could tell) so I don't think there's a high demand for dim sum.  And also, I sooooooo felt like taking a pic of this, but a Mexican lady was pushing one of the dim sum carts. That is unheard of in SF.  This is a mainly mandarin restaurant and the dim sum places I go are usually cantonese.  Not a big deal though since the dishes look the same. \n\nDude, there was a turtle in the fish tank that I saw as I left.  I hope they don't eat that!","A Premier Chinese Atmosphere,\nThe Chinese cultural center and Asian Garden produces an Asain atmosphere that can be recognized from the 202.  \n With Dim Sum served this location earns its respect from the local community.\n\nDim Sum tip,  You have to be smart with the Dim Sum ladies they look nice innocent but they are professional sales people that will sell you more dishes than you need before you know what to do.  \n\nI love the desserts here ask the server to see the dessert tray.","This restaurant has a bit of an identity crisis. It is in the Chinese cultural center, but serves Japanese beer (Kirin on tap!) and the live piano music is American pop. We had to ask for chopsticks.\n\nHaving said that, the service was professional. Our waiter held a hot appetizer for one of our party who was away from the table so that it would not be cold when he returned. We were asked frequently--and not too frequently--if things were ok both by our waiter and the manager/proprietor.\n\nThe food was ok-to-good. Fried shrimp egg rolls were dainty but yummy. Duck was tasty but very chewy. Kung-pao chicken was pleasantly spiced. Plenty of rice. A pitcher of ice water with lemon was left at the table. \n\nAtmosphere was also pleasant. Chairs comfortable, tables spaced well, restrooms large and clean...and there is indeed a large golden Buddha by the entrance.","I took a group of friends here and relatives other times. The place is consistently good for Dim-sum during lunch. It is typical Chinese and nothing fancy.\n\nWhat helps this place is the moat scenery.  3 stars for visiting here based on convenience since there are similar places in town.","Having grown up in Hong Kong and having eaten dim sum in London, NY, LA, SF and Vancouver (actually Richmond), I can confidently say I know my dim sum.\n\nGood selection of well-executed dim sum when the carts actually come around and there's anything left in it.  I'd give it 4 stars for food but the wait definitely detracted from the whole experience.\n\nI think the problem with Golden Buddha is that they can't handle the heavy flow on weekends.  There's not enough regular dim sum eaters like LA that can sustain a steady flow of diners throughout the week, forcing restaurants like Golden Buddha to depend heavily on extra part-time help on weekends.  \n\nDim sum takes serious skill so the chef still ends up doing most of the work.  When we looked into the kitchen, we saw a Chinese woman doing most of the cooking herself.  No wonder it took forever for a cart to come out and when it does, it's swarmed on by a pack of vultures.\n\nIf you're willing to eat at a more simply decorated place with a smaller menu, I'd highly recommend China Chan.  It's much more relaxed - usually no wait on weekends.  An experienced chef makes all the dim sum himself so the menu's much shorter but all the classics are on it.  Anything steamed is made to order so is very fresh.","Situated in the Chinese Cultural Center near the SkyHarbor Airport, this was another pleasant find. All I had was the Dim Sum menu, and I would say this is the best you're gonna get in Phoenix. Still worth the stop to get your Dim Sum fix. The cart ladies were pleasant and very happy to converse with me in Cantonese. Only downside was the chicken sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaves, naw mei gai, was way overcooked, and mushy.","Do you want to eat Chinese Food in an elegant environment on a Friday night in Phoenix? \n\nBe entertained by classic, quiet standards being played live on a piano while you dine?\n\nAre you 50 years old and Caucasian?\n\nThen the Golden Buddha is the place for you! \n\nIts in the Chinese Cultural Center Mall on 44th, and a popular weekend spot for Dim Sum. For a DIm Sum starved Valley of the Sun, Golden Buddha's is decent. \n\nFor dinner, though, it is awfully Americanized and not very authentic Chinese. But with a bunch of American customers coming for dinner, what do you expect? They probably think they are getting \"real Chinese\" food by going to the Chinese Mall, but then again, they are used to PF Chang's or Stix normally in their neighborhood, so this is a step up.\n\nThe best thing about this place is the decor, which is clean and nice, with a Hong Kong Junk boat design covering the ceiling from the bar into the dining room. The next best thing is the Piano interludes on weekend nights. The service is next, which is a little overly eager to remove your plate, and the last thing is the food. \n\nThey do give decent portions. I ordered Guo Teh (potstickers) and got 6 fat ones. But they weren't served with the usual soy, chili oil and vinegar, but a soy and green onions mixture. The Mapo Tofu was ok, as they used a nice silky tofu, which was nice, but no green onions, and sliced black mushrooms instead, which I like, but not in this dish.\n\nCome here for the ambiance and music in the evenings, or on the weekend days for Dim Sum.","Decent dim sum, especially to be found in the middle of the desert. Sadly, the best food I've had in Phoenix.","This place is a little difficult for me to review.  I was staying at the Hampton Inn across the street and this is the closest restaurant so off I went.\n\nI walked in and the owner or manager met me at the door and asked \"how many\"?\n\nI told him I wanted to order take out and handed me a menu and pointed to the waiting area which was covered in newspapers.  I chose to go to the bar, order a glass of wine, and peruse the menu.\n\nThe drinks are expensive but I didn't think the food was.  Less than $10 for my Mongolian Chicken which came with white sticky rice and a fortune cookie.  When ordering I asked if I could have fried rice instead of white rice but was told \"no\".  Most places allow this for a nominal fee.\n\nFine by me.  Give the white rice.  Food was prepared and their to-go boxes were a lot better than the standard white Chinese \"to go\" boxes.  They also included the plastic-ware, napkin, and soy sauce, which a lot of places forget.\n\nLooking around I found a whole lot of goodness along with a couple disappointments.  Most notably the newspaper strewn about and behind the bar, to the right were a lot of boxes stacked in an unsightly fashion.  I could have been a little more presentable in my opinion.\n\nI peeked into the dining room because I wanted to see if the piano music was piped in or live.  It was live which was very nice. Also, the dinning room looked very nice and cozy.\n\nAs I was leaving the same man who greeted me upon entering made sure to wish me a good evening.  My initial impression of the man was that he was surly and testy but that's just how he comes off.\n\nThe food was very good.  The Mongolian sauce was mixture of sweet with spice and the chicken and vegetables all tasted fresh.","My husband and I went there Saturday, the service was great!  Our friends were going to be late so they told us to start.  And start we did!\nThey were serving Dim Sum, something we had never tried, so glad we did, it was wonderful, hubby wouldn't do the chicken feet, but I think next time I will, it looked very good.\nOur friends showed up and ordered their food, and ate all of it, they said that usually they take food home, but it was so good they had to eat all of it!\nWe will be going back very soon!","Let's see, over 50... check \nold white man...........check \neats dinner ...............check \nlistens to the piano  check \n\nwow this must be the place for me, I mean after all it is in a Chinese mall, no make that a Chinese Cultural Center. How could I possibly have discerning taste with such trickery to get me here to eat. \nDude if you are going to rate a restaurant no need to degrade others with your arrogance. \nFool is my review of wanugee N. \n\nNow on the restaurant. The last time we were here the food was not good, the piano was too loud and the waitress had a real attitude. IT won't keep me from going back as I have had good meals and wait service too. \n\nBack to wanugee N. I do not expect any place in Phx. to have authentic Chinese food, by that I mean the street food one finds in China. \nBut I do expect what I fork in to my mouth is worth what I am going to fork over in cost. Even an old white guy like me can tell the difference between good and bad food. No matter what it is called.","Okay so Ive been glum the past few days as I have an impending birthday. Every year this time I get all down in the dumps.. not that I'm not happy with my life cause life is good. Its more like getting further away from my youth and closer to being well, old. All of my grandparents were crotchety, sourpuss drama queens.. is that my fate? Can I break the mold or am I to going to be a crotchety sourpuss?\n\nSo as I contemplate and figure out what I'm going to do with my birthday baggage I decide to squash it with food. All weekend Ive been eating out and having a good time. This is one of the few times outside of a vacation where I will live it completely and to the near of sheer gluttony. So why not dim sum? \n\nIve chowed much dim sum in my 36 years of earthen wear.. of course some good and some bad. I have never been to a place where every dish was great.. Golden Buddha is no exception to this.. they do the basics well enough and have enough funky cool Asian style to keep me interested in returning. The carts around 1130 flow well but around noon it' s full blown freeway action! In fact there might be some road kill in there based on some of the looks on that last steam cart.. \n\nMe and 3 others who were feeling my pain ordered 14, count them, 14 different dishes. One of my friends is from Georgia and had never had dim sum but he is so courageous and unflinching that he was just a blast. Just the shot in the arm to get me out of my funk. I remember the first time I had dim sum.. my eyes wide open, nostrils flared and excited to see what was under the next steamer lid. That was him today.. one exciting thing after the next.. he was even willing to try chicken feet but this is one of those dishes not done very well here. \n\nMy friend took me back to a time where I was younger and less experienced. He looked up to me to guide him through the noodles, bao and sui mai.. like a big brother.. I'm privileged that I could show him something new and exciting and he was so into it! So instead of feeling sorry for myself I felt experienced and useful.. that there is something I can give back to others.. that its not all about me and me aging but about what can be shared with others.\n\nThere is so much more to do, give and feel in this short time we are here.. and Ill do it to, one bite at a time.","The best to be found in land locked Arizona.  My favorite sticky rice is here.  They have dim sum every day, but not a huge selection, though you can order off the menu.  I think it is much bigger on the weekends.  I'm just happy I can get my fix 7 days a week.  Beautiful gardens to walk through, with fish ponds, and a 99 market next door!","I ate at Golden Buddha a few weeks ago.  We ate at the restaurant after a day at the zoo with our 4 year old and had a blast.  The piano bar played tunes for my daughter and the staff was more than accommodating.  The general tso chicken was better than anything I can get in Tucson.  The soup was chocked full of fresh, read FRESH, not canned, vegetables.  All in all, I was very satisfied with the meal and the service.  Plus the decor is very nice, clean and cheery. \n\nEat at Golden Buddha.","For those who gave this place low marks, forgive me. I really like this place. Now I haven't tried various dim sum places so I'm reserving the right to downgrade the place as needed. The variety of food is plentiful, and the carts just keep on coming. I love the steamed pork buns, and the shiu mai (not sure if I spelled that correctly). Yesterday, my favorite pick was the deep fried rolls of taro and shrimp. YUM! I have never ordered from their menu so I can only talk about their dim sum. My friends and I try to go eat dim sum almost every Sunday. It's a cheap way to try new foods, and if you don't like it, well.. you can get away with pushing it aside with minimal guilt. Give it a try! You might be surprised.","I like Golden Buddha, have taken many friends there for Dim Sum.  \nTry not to \"hit\" the dumpling cart to heavy; otherwise cannot finish it to the dessert cart (LOL).\nLove the jasmine tea and the staff willing to help you if you do not understand the what each item is.\nSingapore Rice Noodles a favorite, along with any of the shrimp dumplings; also the broccoli and green beans.\nOnly wish that the carts with eggplant stuffed with shrimp or green peppers with shrimp were not on \"heated\" carts; by the time it gets to you the food is cold.\nOnly concern is that went on 22MAY2010 at 1:30PM; there was a closed sign due to electricity???\nREVISED: 26MAY2010 - called this evening - looks like they are back open again.","I've been to the Golden Buddha on several occasions and it is my favorite, by far, for honest Chinese food. \nWhile I've sampled everything from their vegetarian to their beef, I love their mandarin chicken. More recently, I was delighted to relive the wonders of their Kung Pao Chicken and Beef with Broccoli. \nI absolutely love the egg drop soup and mini crab rangoons that come with the meal.","The very first time I went to Golden Buddha was with my BFF and it was our first dim sum experience. Little did I know this would forever change my life and eating experiences. Although I must admit that first time was a bit awkward.\n\nGB wisely takes reservations which was wonderful (even though it wasn't crazy busy). Our assorted dim sum plates were flavorful and fresh. And the carts seemed to be in constant rotation so we were never too far from a good selection.\n\nWhat really helps GB is its location. The Cofco Center is an experience in itself, where one can have herbs specially blended, select a fresh member of marine life to take home and cook or browse through a store with one of the largest selections of Buddhas and hand fans I've experienced outside of San Francisco.","I've been to Golden Buddha a few times and have not been disappointed. \n\nThey have a LARGE selection of Dim Sum and if you're not careful you can get carried away.\n\nTry and get there early and you'll get the best and most fresh selection.\nMake sure you walk around the garden when you're done.","Probably the most comprehensive Chinese menu in the Valley.  Pick from well over 100 dishes, but if you want the best order the Peking Duck.  Everything else is very good, but without a wow factor.  You'll see lots of Chinese people in this massive restaurant, which probably means they're doing a fine job in the kitchen.","I very much enjoyed eating here. Food was great. Fairly fast service. Wasn't expensive either for the 4 of us.","Golden Buddha has GREAT dim sum.  Their prices are reasonable and the staff is very polite wheeling their little carts.  I tend to go on the weekend because there is more selection but they do dim sum throughout the week.  They also have some very authentic dishes on the menu for those who are more of the adventurous types.  Be sure to say hello to the turtles the next time you go.","This place in the Chinese Cultural Center has a very pretty and elegant bar area. I was pleased to learn that they had some very reasonable and delicious happy hour snacks. This is a good place for a Pina Colada. I had one by myself along with some dumplings and fried shrimp appetizer. Sadly I never brought anyone else here with me. It was happy hour heaven but you know? A lot of my friends in AZ pretty much hang out in one neighborhood or another and nobody I know really lives close to the Buddha.\nThe airport is pretty close by. This might be a good pre-flight send-off location.","I have had dim sum in New Orleans and Phoenix (not SF), and this is about equal to the best of New Orleans as far as flavor.\nAs for ambiance, today was a good day. I've had dim sum here about a dozen times, and have had very good service and quality 90% of the time, including weekends. I have had bad days here, but since today was good, I'll rate accordingly. It's closer to a 4.5, but since I can't give half-stars, I rounded up.\nDon't expect me to give these the right names, but... I was less than impressed with the bbq pork balls. They tasted too much like honey and the beef was minimal. The bbq sauce tasted bottled. Outside of that, their herbal hot tea is delicious even on a hot day.\nThe shu mai were very good, and the shrimp in a spinach dumpling was fantastic. A definite don't miss is their sticky rice in lotus leaf. It's among the best I've had anywhere. Just be careful; you'll find bones in it every once in a while. Go for any of their steamed dumplings; they're very flavorful. As others have said, I love the Chinese broccoli, but you'll only find it on the carts on weekends. Otherwise order it off the menu.\nToday (11:30 lunch) the carts came around often, and everything except the pork buns was piping hot and fresh. By the way, despite the price increases, even the sticky rice was considered a medium size entree, and the two of us eating there escaped with a bill under $20 and we were done in under 30 minutes.\nI strongly recommend the dim sum here, whether you've had it a million times or have never had it before. You usually won't be disappointed.","I don't really understand the poor reviews on this place.....maybe it depends on the day you go? We went on a Sunday, it was crazy busy, but service was great! (of course, my view of customer service is a little different then the rest... I used to live on an island where you were just happy to find what you were looking for, let alone expect good customer service) Anyways, our server was very sweet! Always had a smile on her face. The carts served us promplty and none of the food was cold. They always had whatever we wanted (I hate having to wait for the next cart).\n\nNow, as for the actual dim sum and food.......holy cow, to die for! So flavorful and fresh!! The broccoli makes you sing...and the wine noodles, make you cry. You leave with very weird mixed emotions, but mostly a happy belly full of yummy food.\n\nIn my opinion, this is the best dim sum I have been able to find in Phx. I'm ditching my previous spot (Mekong Palace) and will be back to Golden Buddha when the dim sum monster strikes again!"],"type":["Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low

waiter was to be found about ten minutes later they gave us our water and left again! It wasn't even busy! There were only TWO dim sum carts floating around somewhere. Then our waiter finally came around and took our orders of lunch entrees. The food was not even that good as the reviews that are posted on here. When we came up to pay, the bill was super overpriced. I will not be returning here, I am better off eating at Great Wall Cuisine.","If this place had zero stars I would have given them that ! Let me start off by saying I was so excited to read all great reviews so maybe I just came in on a off day? We walked in and were seated came over and asked if we wanted water or tea I guess they don't serve anything Else, Then we placed an order pork dumplings and sticky rice nasty! Then I asked if they served egg rolls they said they were out!!! they pushed their little carts around with hot plates that basically steam the food and is not fresh and what you get is soggy poor customer service we had to get up and look for someone to give us our tab so we could get the heck out of there are get some real food. It looked like it would be a great place for groups of people would not recommend if you are on mission for what you want and want to place an order but it could be a fun experience for some people.","You walk into a Chinese restaurant on a Saturday afternoon for dim sum and you expect the place to be PACKED.  Well, walking in to a pretty much empty dining room, it's a VERY CLEAR SIGN.  But my friend insisted and I was very hesitant for good reasons.  Another indicator, the majority of the patrons were NON Asian.  \n\nFood: You walk in and you see carts of the food by the entrance to the dining room.  Umm, I thought dim sum should come right off the steamer and into the carts and they roll it around, not sitting around.  The dim sum was garbage.  It had the typical selection, but at minimum.  \n\nService: It's ok.  But it doesn't make up for the horrible food.\n\nBottom line: NO WAY!  Stay away!","I've been here many times...Mother's Day with family, dim sum with book club, etc. But I will not go back again.  I stopped in to ask the owner about a donation or reduced price for a class of under-privileged kids that I volunteer with.  His reaction was to scoff and shoo me out the door while handing me his card and saying I could email him.  He turned his back and headed off to the messy newspaper-strewn table he haunts between guests arrivals.  Maybe he's a community-minded business owner, but then again, maybe he's not.  I'll be dining elsewhere.","Being from Chicago, we are used to getting authentic Chinese food all the time.  But when we first starting spending a lot of time in Scottsdale/Phoenix, we found it a challenge to get authentic Chinese food.  We were excited to find the Golden Buddha and have made many trips over the years all the way from the Troon North area to get our fix.  However, service has declined to the point where it is no longer worth the aggravation.  We went there last night for Chinese New Year and will never go back.  Granted they were very busy because of a lot of large tables there, but waiting almost an hour to get our food is not acceptable under any circumstance!  45 mins. into our wait, the waitress came back (after we flagged her down to ask about our food) and said one of the dishes we ordered was not available....after 45 mins.!!!! What makes the whole experience an unforgivable one is that the manager/owner is so indifferent and never apologized or offered a discount off the bill...nothing.  When we left, the same manager was at the piano singing in Chinese. Huh?  Other than Nee House in Scottsdale, the search goes on for a restaurant that serves authentic Chinese food closer to home.","I will NEVER go there again.  I reserved a table for a group of 16 people for 5:00 PM on Christmas Eve .  The person on the phone ( I believe the manager) repeatedly asked me to call ahead and give him an accurate head count since he said they'd be swamped that day.  I followed up with him twice.  \nWhen the first couple of us arrived, we had menus shoved in our faces immediately and told we \"Must order now.  Must order now\" because they were going to be busy later on.  The place was practically empty.  As each person arrived, they were treated the same way. \nWe rushed and placed our orders and then they brought out our checks WAY before we saw any sign of our food.  I have never in my life been treated so rudely by a restaurant.\nIt was utter chaos when the food started coming out while everyone struggled to get the correct dish they ordered.  One person didn't get her food until we were all just about finished eating. \nOne top of all that, the food wasn't even good.  I've had better Kung Pao Chicken at Panda Express!\nAfter being rushed through our meal, the place wasn't even half full by the time we left.  I thought being at the Cultural Center, this restaurant would be a sure thing but boy was I wrong.  Lovely way to spend Christmas Eve..","If you are looking a chinese restaurant to host a big party look some other than the Golden Buddah.  I recently attended a banquet at the Golden Buddah and I was shocked at the level of quality of food and service.  Of the 10 dishes served 4 were nearly inedible.  \n\nThere was a crab claw appetizer, most chinese restaurants prepare this dish by taking a crab claw surrounding it with ground shrimp, batter and then deep fry.  At Golden Buddah, the crab claw served was mostly batter.  \n\nThe shark fin soup served was mostly broth.  Shark fin is an expensive ingredient and most places usually use imitation shark fin, but come on at least put something in there so that I know I'm eating soup and not dirty sink water.  \n\nGinger scallion lobster is battered, fried, and then stir fried in a sauce with ginger and scallions.  The ginger scallion lobster served was over-cooked and dried out.  \n\nLastly, there was a steamed fish.  The fish was raw in the middle.   \n\nIt wasn't all bad, there was a crispy chicken with garlic dish that was pretty good, but out of 10 dishes 4 were bad, 5 were okay, and 1 was good.  \n\nDoes 4 bad dishes out of 10 warrant a one star rating?  Well it does when you factor in the service.  The soup, appetizer, and first entree arrived timely, but after that there was a 1 hour gap before we received the next dish.  The dishes were not served with accompanying white rice which I thought was odd.  We had to ask for it, and even the rice took a while to arrive.","I agree with Crystal C., that the dim sum isn't the greatest I've ever had. In fact, I am not sure if the meal was so tasty that it was memorable. I do remember the \"calamari\" was not really calamari, like you would think. It was presented more like a sweet and sour pork (so calamari with LOTS of breading) without any sauce. As a result, the dish was dry and salty.\n\nThe sticky rice was good (hard to mess up), the chicken feet were okay (needed more five spice powder), and the shumai was alright. The noodles were good, and I can see why the cart ran out after the first round. The diners were an equal mix of Asians and Americans. I would've preferred to see more Asians eating (as I am used to in a Chinatown and gives an indication of authenticity), but I do realize we're in Phoenix where the Asian population is not like San Francisco or Houston. \n\nThe meal came to about $30 for two, including jasmine tea. The carts are loud because they are made out of metal and roll on tile. I am also not used to staff members shouting what they have in their cart, like a newspaper boy yelling \"Extra! Extra!\" Christmas music was playing after mid-January, so the atmosphere felt strange. Next time I visit the city, I probably will pass.","Can't say that I was very impressed. Came for dinner in a hopeful and enthusiastic mood since the reviews have been pretty good, but I don't think this place lives up to its current good, but declining rating.\n\nOrdered the Combo fried rice (shrimp, chicken, beef, pork), sesame chicken, and garlic fried chicken. \n\nThe combo fried rice was pretty good, but ended up drinking about 6 glasses of water due to the MSG and sodium content. You'd think that the cook spent his better years in the French Foreign Legion in the Sahara eating salt tablets and developed a taste for them. \n\nThe sesame chicken had a good flavor and a thick brown sweet sauce. I liked it a lot until it got cool and the sauce looked (with that stringy consistency) more like glue. You think I'm kidding? I'm not.\n\nGarlic fried chicken was bad. Just bad. It was like an over roasted dried out half chicken with some dried garlic pieces sprinkled on top. No spices, no flavor, no good. \n\nWe then got all kinds of lip from the waitress when we asked if they could change the channel on the TV from college football, to the Suns game. They made it into this big deal that the \"customers\" wanted to see the football game. Yeah right, it was University of West Virginia Vs. University of Connecticut! I would have believed it if it was a local team....\n\nIt's better than a 1 star joint, but only because it's borderline edible. To be avoided.","This restaurant is located in the Chinese Cultural Center and was the one restaurant that I had not been to. So after some shopping at one of the shops, we stepped in to have dinner.\n\nWe stepped in and asked for a seat for two. We were seated immediately. The place was decorated nicely and a lady playing the piano made for great ambiance.\n\nWe looked at the menu briefly and ordered our drinks, an appetizer, a soup and two main dishes. The drinks came out promptly and so did the rest of the meal. My goodness everything we ordered was very tasty.\n\nThe waiter service itself however was not even close to the decor and food. He never introduced himself, and although he took our order, our food itself was brought out by a kitchen person.\n\nAfter we ordered our waiter really never came back asking if we needed anything else, except to give us our check at the end and that was after the person I was dining with got up and asked a different waiter for it.\n\nIt's amazing how a place with great food, decor, and ambiance can mess it all up by crappy waiter service.","I love Dim Sum, my favorite Chinese dish.\n\nWhen Golden Buddha first open, they have excellent Dim sum. I went there many times, I tell my friend how good it is, But now,  they change cook, taste more like  week old left over. Rumor has it, they change cook every few month, so Quality of cooking change. (not sure if that is true, but that is what I was told.)\nMy advice is; when you walk in the door and the place is pack, = Good Cook. if the place is bare = bad cook. leave immediately. don't waste your money.","If you just \"want\" dim sum, go here. If you are \"craving\" dim sum, go elsewhere (take a 5 hour drive west to neighboring state, California).\n\nAnyway, I've been visiting Golden Buddha in the noontime for roughly 2 years now. I believe they moved from their original site (7th St. & Osborn), formerly \"China Doll.\" Relocation brought along better atmosphere and smiling faces. This does not mean, better dim sum. But since we are in Phoenix, I will settle for what they have to offer. \n\nBe mindful of the dim sum tab. It's itemized high-medium-low. \n\nShaomai can be found as combinations of pork/mushroom, shrimp, or shark fin (which should not be confused as true shark bits, as the shaomai is prepared to look like a shark's fin). These picks are okay...perhaps on a better day shao mai will be served in less-rigid, or fresher wrappers. Potstickers are okay as well, just the usual scallion and pork, and dry wrapper. The baby pork ribs in light black bean sauce and jalapenos is alright, but sometimes lacks in taste. Tripe is also served in its bare minimum...so if you enjoy the texture and flavor of tripe, try this with its clear sauce and thinly sliced carrots and celery.  \nBuche (that's what I call it), or fried sesame balls are also available, although if you wait until dessert, they will also be a bit stiff. There are a few other things that may be \"spotted\" but are not worth mentioning. \n\nDon't order from their lunch menu, as you can find these over-salted dishes at Panda Express anyway. \n\nOverall, dim sum at Golden Buddha is a place to go if you are around the vicinity and feel like having something apart from the usual fast food. However, discriminating palates- beware.","Not impressed with this place at all. This was not the friendliest place around, maybe because of the language barrier (most or all were clearly native Chinese speakers), or maybe just the attitude of the employees.\n\nI ordered the sweet and sour chicken lunch, which came with the typical egg drop soup, crab rangoon, and egg roll. The soup was ok - maybe it's just me, but I prefer a real spoon to the scoop that they gave me. The egg roll was tiny and not that great, and the crab rangoon was ok, but maybe a little undercooked. The chicken wasn't bad, but nothing special, as was the rice and other stuff on the plate.\n\nOverall, this was just not my kind of Chinese place.","Disappointing.  Mediocre at best.  I am staying at the Aloft hotel in phoenix and ordered some delivery. I ordered a couple american chinese food staples: general tso's chicken, dumplings and hot&sour soup.  Soup had zero flavor, dumplings tasted freezer burned and processed.  General tso chicken was ehh. \n\nA lot of good reviews on here so it must be for eat in and for their dim sum.  Don't order delivery, you will be left hungry and unsatisfied.","Went there on Saturday for early lunch.  My wife did the dim sum, it was okay, we were both disgusted by the sugar cane shrimp; but the rest was good.  \n\nI ordered the chicken szechwuan, the waitress warned me it was \"spicy\" the reason I ordered it.  It came out delicious, but not what I would call spicy.  Overall its hard to find good Chinese in the valley and I would call this good without hesitation.","So I was referred to this place from the front desk of my hotel. I'm from SF so I'm coming from a place with really good chinese food. \n\nThe dim sum is just \"ok\" nothing for me to write home about. The one dish that I really liked was the chinese broccoli cooked with garlic sauce. Yum yum yum.  It's in a big bowl, not oily, not saucy, just really good. I think it's $7.50.  \n\nIt's a somewhat pricey and just like all chinese restaurants, it's not the cleanest.  The chair was filthy.  the dishes weren't all that great.  I wouldn't go back unless I want the chinese broccoli.  \n\nSo I went on a Sunday and it was not crowded at all. There's not a huge asian population  in Phoenix (not that I could tell) so I don't think there's a high demand for dim sum.  And also, I sooooooo felt like taking a pic of this, but a Mexican lady was pushing one of the dim sum carts. That is unheard of in SF.  This is a mainly mandarin restaurant and the dim sum places I go are usually cantonese.  Not a big deal though since the dishes look the same. \n\nDude, there was a turtle in the fish tank that I saw as I left.  I hope they don't eat that!","A Premier Chinese Atmosphere,\nThe Chinese cultural center and Asian Garden produces an Asain atmosphere that can be recognized from the 202.  \n With Dim Sum served this location earns its respect from the local community.\n\nDim Sum tip,  You have to be smart with the Dim Sum ladies they look nice innocent but they are professional sales people that will sell you more dishes than you need before you know what to do.  \n\nI love the desserts here ask the server to see the dessert tray.","This restaurant has a bit of an identity crisis. It is in the Chinese cultural center, but serves Japanese beer (Kirin on tap!) and the live piano music is American pop. We had to ask for chopsticks.\n\nHaving said that, the service was professional. Our waiter held a hot appetizer for one of our party who was away from the table so that it would not be cold when he returned. We were asked frequently--and not too frequently--if things were ok both by our waiter and the manager/proprietor.\n\nThe food was ok-to-good. Fried shrimp egg rolls were dainty but yummy. Duck was tasty but very chewy. Kung-pao chicken was pleasantly spiced. Plenty of rice. A pitcher of ice water with lemon was left at the table. \n\nAtmosphere was also pleasant. Chairs comfortable, tables spaced well, restrooms large and clean...and there is indeed a large golden Buddha by the entrance.","I took a group of friends here and relatives other times. The place is consistently good for Dim-sum during lunch. It is typical Chinese and nothing fancy.\n\nWhat helps this place is the moat scenery.  3 stars for visiting here based on convenience since there are similar places in town.","Having grown up in Hong Kong and having eaten dim sum in London, NY, LA, SF and Vancouver (actually Richmond), I can confidently say I know my dim sum.\n\nGood selection of well-executed dim sum when the carts actually come around and there's anything left in it.  I'd give it 4 stars for food but the wait definitely detracted from the whole experience.\n\nI think the problem with Golden Buddha is that they can't handle the heavy flow on weekends.  There's not enough regular dim sum eaters like LA that can sustain a steady flow of diners throughout the week, forcing restaurants like Golden Buddha to depend heavily on extra part-time help on weekends.  \n\nDim sum takes serious skill so the chef still ends up doing most of the work.  When we looked into the kitchen, we saw a Chinese woman doing most of the cooking herself.  No wonder it took forever for a cart to come out and when it does, it's swarmed on by a pack of vultures.\n\nIf you're willing to eat at a more simply decorated place with a smaller menu, I'd highly recommend China Chan.  It's much more relaxed - usually no wait on weekends.  An experienced chef makes all the dim sum himself so the menu's much shorter but all the classics are on it.  Anything steamed is made to order so is very fresh.","Situated in the Chinese Cultural Center near the SkyHarbor Airport, this was another pleasant find. All I had was the Dim Sum menu, and I would say this is the best you're gonna get in Phoenix. Still worth the stop to get your Dim Sum fix. The cart ladies were pleasant and very happy to converse with me in Cantonese. Only downside was the chicken sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaves, naw mei gai, was way overcooked, and mushy.","Do you want to eat Chinese Food in an elegant environment on a Friday night in Phoenix? \n\nBe entertained by classic, quiet standards being played live on a piano while you dine?\n\nAre you 50 years old and Caucasian?\n\nThen the Golden Buddha is the place for you! \n\nIts in the Chinese Cultural Center Mall on 44th, and a popular weekend spot for Dim Sum. For a DIm Sum starved Valley of the Sun, Golden Buddha's is decent. \n\nFor dinner, though, it is awfully Americanized and not very authentic Chinese. But with a bunch of American customers coming for dinner, what do you expect? They probably think they are getting \"real Chinese\" food by going to the Chinese Mall, but then again, they are used to PF Chang's or Stix normally in their neighborhood, so this is a step up.\n\nThe best thing about this place is the decor, which is clean and nice, with a Hong Kong Junk boat design covering the ceiling from the bar into the dining room. The next best thing is the Piano interludes on weekend nights. The service is next, which is a little overly eager to remove your plate, and the last thing is the food. \n\nThey do give decent portions. I ordered Guo Teh (potstickers) and got 6 fat ones. But they weren't served with the usual soy, chili oil and vinegar, but a soy and green onions mixture. The Mapo Tofu was ok, as they used a nice silky tofu, which was nice, but no green onions, and sliced black mushrooms instead, which I like, but not in this dish.\n\nCome here for the ambiance and music in the evenings, or on the weekend days for Dim Sum.","Decent dim sum, especially to be found in the middle of the desert. Sadly, the best food I've had in Phoenix.","This place is a little difficult for me to review.  I was staying at the Hampton Inn across the street and this is the closest restaurant so off I went.\n\nI walked in and the owner or manager met me at the door and asked \"how many\"?\n\nI told him I wanted to order take out and handed me a menu and pointed to the waiting area which was covered in newspapers.  I chose to go to the bar, order a glass of wine, and peruse the menu.\n\nThe drinks are expensive but I didn't think the food was.  Less than $10 for my Mongolian Chicken which came with white sticky rice and a fortune cookie.  When ordering I asked if I could have fried rice instead of white rice but was told \"no\".  Most places allow this for a nominal fee.\n\nFine by me.  Give the white rice.  Food was prepared and their to-go boxes were a lot better than the standard white Chinese \"to go\" boxes.  They also included the plastic-ware, napkin, and soy sauce, which a lot of places forget.\n\nLooking around I found a whole lot of goodness along with a couple disappointments.  Most notably the newspaper strewn about and behind the bar, to the right were a lot of boxes stacked in an unsightly fashion.  I could have been a little more presentable in my opinion.\n\nI peeked into the dining room because I wanted to see if the piano music was piped in or live.  It was live which was very nice. Also, the dinning room looked very nice and cozy.\n\nAs I was leaving the same man who greeted me upon entering made sure to wish me a good evening.  My initial impression of the man was that he was surly and testy but that's just how he comes off.\n\nThe food was very good.  The Mongolian sauce was mixture of sweet with spice and the chicken and vegetables all tasted fresh.","My husband and I went there Saturday, the service was great!  Our friends were going to be late so they told us to start.  And start we did!\nThey were serving Dim Sum, something we had never tried, so glad we did, it was wonderful, hubby wouldn't do the chicken feet, but I think next time I will, it looked very good.\nOur friends showed up and ordered their food, and ate all of it, they said that usually they take food home, but it was so good they had to eat all of it!\nWe will be going back very soon!","Let's see, over 50... check \nold white man...........check \neats dinner ...............check \nlistens to the piano  check \n\nwow this must be the place for me, I mean after all it is in a Chinese mall, no make that a Chinese Cultural Center. How could I possibly have discerning taste with such trickery to get me here to eat. \nDude if you are going to rate a restaurant no need to degrade others with your arrogance. \nFool is my review of wanugee N. \n\nNow on the restaurant. The last time we were here the food was not good, the piano was too loud and the waitress had a real attitude. IT won't keep me from going back as I have had good meals and wait service too. \n\nBack to wanugee N. I do not expect any place in Phx. to have authentic Chinese food, by that I mean the street food one finds in China. \nBut I do expect what I fork in to my mouth is worth what I am going to fork over in cost. Even an old white guy like me can tell the difference between good and bad food. No matter what it is called.","Okay so Ive been glum the past few days as I have an impending birthday. Every year this time I get all down in the dumps.. not that I'm not happy with my life cause life is good. Its more like getting further away from my youth and closer to being well, old. All of my grandparents were crotchety, sourpuss drama queens.. is that my fate? Can I break the mold or am I to going to be a crotchety sourpuss?\n\nSo as I contemplate and figure out what I'm going to do with my birthday baggage I decide to squash it with food. All weekend Ive been eating out and having a good time. This is one of the few times outside of a vacation where I will live it completely and to the near of sheer gluttony. So why not dim sum? \n\nIve chowed much dim sum in my 36 years of earthen wear.. of course some good and some bad. I have never been to a place where every dish was great.. Golden Buddha is no exception to this.. they do the basics well enough and have enough funky cool Asian style to keep me interested in returning. The carts around 1130 flow well but around noon it' s full blown freeway action! In fact there might be some road kill in there based on some of the looks on that last steam cart.. \n\nMe and 3 others who were feeling my pain ordered 14, count them, 14 different dishes. One of my friends is from Georgia and had never had dim sum but he is so courageous and unflinching that he was just a blast. Just the shot in the arm to get me out of my funk. I remember the first time I had dim sum.. my eyes wide open, nostrils flared and excited to see what was under the next steamer lid. That was him today.. one exciting thing after the next.. he was even willing to try chicken feet but this is one of those dishes not done very well here. \n\nMy friend took me back to a time where I was younger and less experienced. He looked up to me to guide him through the noodles, bao and sui mai.. like a big brother.. I'm privileged that I could show him something new and exciting and he was so into it! So instead of feeling sorry for myself I felt experienced and useful.. that there is something I can give back to others.. that its not all about me and me aging but about what can be shared with others.\n\nThere is so much more to do, give and feel in this short time we are here.. and Ill do it to, one bite at a time.","The best to be found in land locked Arizona.  My favorite sticky rice is here.  They have dim sum every day, but not a huge selection, though you can order off the menu.  I think it is much bigger on the weekends.  I'm just happy I can get my fix 7 days a week.  Beautiful gardens to walk through, with fish ponds, and a 99 market next door!","I ate at Golden Buddha a few weeks ago.  We ate at the restaurant after a day at the zoo with our 4 year old and had a blast.  The piano bar played tunes for my daughter and the staff was more than accommodating.  The general tso chicken was better than anything I can get in Tucson.  The soup was chocked full of fresh, read FRESH, not canned, vegetables.  All in all, I was very satisfied with the meal and the service.  Plus the decor is very nice, clean and cheery. \n\nEat at Golden Buddha.","For those who gave this place low marks, forgive me. I really like this place. Now I haven't tried various dim sum places so I'm reserving the right to downgrade the place as needed. The variety of food is plentiful, and the carts just keep on coming. I love the steamed pork buns, and the shiu mai (not sure if I spelled that correctly). Yesterday, my favorite pick was the deep fried rolls of taro and shrimp. YUM! I have never ordered from their menu so I can only talk about their dim sum. My friends and I try to go eat dim sum almost every Sunday. It's a cheap way to try new foods, and if you don't like it, well.. you can get away with pushing it aside with minimal guilt. Give it a try! You might be surprised.","I like Golden Buddha, have taken many friends there for Dim Sum.  \nTry not to \"hit\" the dumpling cart to heavy; otherwise cannot finish it to the dessert cart (LOL).\nLove the jasmine tea and the staff willing to help you if you do not understand the what each item is.\nSingapore Rice Noodles a favorite, along with any of the shrimp dumplings; also the broccoli and green beans.\nOnly wish that the carts with eggplant stuffed with shrimp or green peppers with shrimp were not on \"heated\" carts; by the time it gets to you the food is cold.\nOnly concern is that went on 22MAY2010 at 1:30PM; there was a closed sign due to electricity???\nREVISED: 26MAY2010 - called this evening - looks like they are back open again.","I've been to the Golden Buddha on several occasions and it is my favorite, by far, for honest Chinese food. \nWhile I've sampled everything from their vegetarian to their beef, I love their mandarin chicken. More recently, I was delighted to relive the wonders of their Kung Pao Chicken and Beef with Broccoli. \nI absolutely love the egg drop soup and mini crab rangoons that come with the meal.","The very first time I went to Golden Buddha was with my BFF and it was our first dim sum experience. Little did I know this would forever change my life and eating experiences. Although I must admit that first time was a bit awkward.\n\nGB wisely takes reservations which was wonderful (even though it wasn't crazy busy). Our assorted dim sum plates were flavorful and fresh. And the carts seemed to be in constant rotation so we were never too far from a good selection.\n\nWhat really helps GB is its location. The Cofco Center is an experience in itself, where one can have herbs specially blended, select a fresh member of marine life to take home and cook or browse through a store with one of the largest selections of Buddhas and hand fans I've experienced outside of San Francisco.","I've been to Golden Buddha a few times and have not been disappointed. \n\nThey have a LARGE selection of Dim Sum and if you're not careful you can get carried away.\n\nTry and get there early and you'll get the best and most fresh selection.\nMake sure you walk around the garden when you're done.","Probably the most comprehensive Chinese menu in the Valley.  Pick from well over 100 dishes, but if you want the best order the Peking Duck.  Everything else is very good, but without a wow factor.  You'll see lots of Chinese people in this massive restaurant, which probably means they're doing a fine job in the kitchen.","I very much enjoyed eating here. Food was great. Fairly fast service. Wasn't expensive either for the 4 of us.","Golden Buddha has GREAT dim sum.  Their prices are reasonable and the staff is very polite wheeling their little carts.  I tend to go on the weekend because there is more selection but they do dim sum throughout the week.  They also have some very authentic dishes on the menu for those who are more of the adventurous types.  Be sure to say hello to the turtles the next time you go.","This place in the Chinese Cultural Center has a very pretty and elegant bar area. I was pleased to learn that they had some very reasonable and delicious happy hour snacks. This is a good place for a Pina Colada. I had one by myself along with some dumplings and fried shrimp appetizer. Sadly I never brought anyone else here with me. It was happy hour heaven but you know? A lot of my friends in AZ pretty much hang out in one neighborhood or another and nobody I know really lives close to the Buddha.\nThe airport is pretty close by. This might be a good pre-flight send-off location.","I have had dim sum in New Orleans and Phoenix (not SF), and this is about equal to the best of New Orleans as far as flavor.\nAs for ambiance, today was a good day. I've had dim sum here about a dozen times, and have had very good service and quality 90% of the time, including weekends. I have had bad days here, but since today was good, I'll rate accordingly. It's closer to a 4.5, but since I can't give half-stars, I rounded up.\nDon't expect me to give these the right names, but... I was less than impressed with the bbq pork balls. They tasted too much like honey and the beef was minimal. The bbq sauce tasted bottled. Outside of that, their herbal hot tea is delicious even on a hot day.\nThe shu mai were very good, and the shrimp in a spinach dumpling was fantastic. A definite don't miss is their sticky rice in lotus leaf. It's among the best I've had anywhere. Just be careful; you'll find bones in it every once in a while. Go for any of their steamed dumplings; they're very flavorful. As others have said, I love the Chinese broccoli, but you'll only find it on the carts on weekends. Otherwise order it off the menu.\nToday (11:30 lunch) the carts came around often, and everything except the pork buns was piping hot and fresh. By the way, despite the price increases, even the sticky rice was considered a medium size entree, and the two of us eating there escaped with a bill under $20 and we were done in under 30 minutes.\nI strongly recommend the dim sum here, whether you've had it a million times or have never had it before. You usually won't be disappointed.","I don't really understand the poor reviews on this place.....maybe it depends on the day you go? We went on a Sunday, it was crazy busy, but service was great! (of course, my view of customer service is a little different then the rest... I used to live on an island where you were just happy to find what you were looking for, let alone expect good customer service) Anyways, our server was very sweet! Always had a smile on her face. The carts served us promplty and none of the food was cold. They always had whatever we wanted (I hate having to wait for the next cart).\n\nNow, as for the actual dim sum and food.......holy cow, to die for! So flavorful and fresh!! The broccoli makes you sing...and the wine noodles, make you cry. You leave with very weird mixed emotions, but mostly a happy belly full of yummy food.\n\nIn my opinion, this is the best dim sum I have been able to find in Phx. I'm ditching my previous spot (Mekong Palace) and will be back to Golden Buddha when the dim sum monster strikes again!"],"type":["Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low

waiter was to be found about ten minutes later they gave us our water and left again! It wasn't even busy! There were only TWO dim sum carts floating around somewhere. Then our waiter finally came around and took our orders of lunch entrees. The food was not even that good as the reviews that are posted on here. When we came up to pay, the bill was super overpriced. I will not be returning here, I am better off eating at Great Wall Cuisine.","If this place had zero stars I would have given them that ! Let me start off by saying I was so excited to read all great reviews so maybe I just came in on a off day? We walked in and were seated came over and asked if we wanted water or tea I guess they don't serve anything Else, Then we placed an order pork dumplings and sticky rice nasty! Then I asked if they served egg rolls they said they were out!!! they pushed their little carts around with hot plates that basically steam the food and is not fresh and what you get is soggy poor customer service we had to get up and look for someone to give us our tab so we could get the heck out of there are get some real food. It looked like it would be a great place for groups of people would not recommend if you are on mission for what you want and want to place an order but it could be a fun experience for some people.","You walk into a Chinese restaurant on a Saturday afternoon for dim sum and you expect the place to be PACKED.  Well, walking in to a pretty much empty dining room, it's a VERY CLEAR SIGN.  But my friend insisted and I was very hesitant for good reasons.  Another indicator, the majority of the patrons were NON Asian.  \n\nFood: You walk in and you see carts of the food by the entrance to the dining room.  Umm, I thought dim sum should come right off the steamer and into the carts and they roll it around, not sitting around.  The dim sum was garbage.  It had the typical selection, but at minimum.  \n\nService: It's ok.  But it doesn't make up for the horrible food.\n\nBottom line: NO WAY!  Stay away!","I've been here many times...Mother's Day with family, dim sum with book club, etc. But I will not go back again.  I stopped in to ask the owner about a donation or reduced price for a class of under-privileged kids that I volunteer with.  His reaction was to scoff and shoo me out the door while handing me his card and saying I could email him.  He turned his back and headed off to the messy newspaper-strewn table he haunts between guests arrivals.  Maybe he's a community-minded business owner, but then again, maybe he's not.  I'll be dining elsewhere.","Being from Chicago, we are used to getting authentic Chinese food all the time.  But when we first starting spending a lot of time in Scottsdale/Phoenix, we found it a challenge to get authentic Chinese food.  We were excited to find the Golden Buddha and have made many trips over the years all the way from the Troon North area to get our fix.  However, service has declined to the point where it is no longer worth the aggravation.  We went there last night for Chinese New Year and will never go back.  Granted they were very busy because of a lot of large tables there, but waiting almost an hour to get our food is not acceptable under any circumstance!  45 mins. into our wait, the waitress came back (after we flagged her down to ask about our food) and said one of the dishes we ordered was not available....after 45 mins.!!!! What makes the whole experience an unforgivable one is that the manager/owner is so indifferent and never apologized or offered a discount off the bill...nothing.  When we left, the same manager was at the piano singing in Chinese. Huh?  Other than Nee House in Scottsdale, the search goes on for a restaurant that serves authentic Chinese food closer to home.","I will NEVER go there again.  I reserved a table for a group of 16 people for 5:00 PM on Christmas Eve .  The person on the phone ( I believe the manager) repeatedly asked me to call ahead and give him an accurate head count since he said they'd be swamped that day.  I followed up with him twice.  \nWhen the first couple of us arrived, we had menus shoved in our faces immediately and told we \"Must order now.  Must order now\" because they were going to be busy later on.  The place was practically empty.  As each person arrived, they were treated the same way. \nWe rushed and placed our orders and then they brought out our checks WAY before we saw any sign of our food.  I have never in my life been treated so rudely by a restaurant.\nIt was utter chaos when the food started coming out while everyone struggled to get the correct dish they ordered.  One person didn't get her food until we were all just about finished eating. \nOne top of all that, the food wasn't even good.  I've had better Kung Pao Chicken at Panda Express!\nAfter being rushed through our meal, the place wasn't even half full by the time we left.  I thought being at the Cultural Center, this restaurant would be a sure thing but boy was I wrong.  Lovely way to spend Christmas Eve..","If you are looking a chinese restaurant to host a big party look some other than the Golden Buddah.  I recently attended a banquet at the Golden Buddah and I was shocked at the level of quality of food and service.  Of the 10 dishes served 4 were nearly inedible.  \n\nThere was a crab claw appetizer, most chinese restaurants prepare this dish by taking a crab claw surrounding it with ground shrimp, batter and then deep fry.  At Golden Buddah, the crab claw served was mostly batter.  \n\nThe shark fin soup served was mostly broth.  Shark fin is an expensive ingredient and most places usually use imitation shark fin, but come on at least put something in there so that I know I'm eating soup and not dirty sink water.  \n\nGinger scallion lobster is battered, fried, and then stir fried in a sauce with ginger and scallions.  The ginger scallion lobster served was over-cooked and dried out.  \n\nLastly, there was a steamed fish.  The fish was raw in the middle.   \n\nIt wasn't all bad, there was a crispy chicken with garlic dish that was pretty good, but out of 10 dishes 4 were bad, 5 were okay, and 1 was good.  \n\nDoes 4 bad dishes out of 10 warrant a one star rating?  Well it does when you factor in the service.  The soup, appetizer, and first entree arrived timely, but after that there was a 1 hour gap before we received the next dish.  The dishes were not served with accompanying white rice which I thought was odd.  We had to ask for it, and even the rice took a while to arrive.","I agree with Crystal C., that the dim sum isn't the greatest I've ever had. In fact, I am not sure if the meal was so tasty that it was memorable. I do remember the \"calamari\" was not really calamari, like you would think. It was presented more like a sweet and sour pork (so calamari with LOTS of breading) without any sauce. As a result, the dish was dry and salty.\n\nThe sticky rice was good (hard to mess up), the chicken feet were okay (needed more five spice powder), and the shumai was alright. The noodles were good, and I can see why the cart ran out after the first round. The diners were an equal mix of Asians and Americans. I would've preferred to see more Asians eating (as I am used to in a Chinatown and gives an indication of authenticity), but I do realize we're in Phoenix where the Asian population is not like San Francisco or Houston. \n\nThe meal came to about $30 for two, including jasmine tea. The carts are loud because they are made out of metal and roll on tile. I am also not used to staff members shouting what they have in their cart, like a newspaper boy yelling \"Extra! Extra!\" Christmas music was playing after mid-January, so the atmosphere felt strange. Next time I visit the city, I probably will pass.","Can't say that I was very impressed. Came for dinner in a hopeful and enthusiastic mood since the reviews have been pretty good, but I don't think this place lives up to its current good, but declining rating.\n\nOrdered the Combo fried rice (shrimp, chicken, beef, pork), sesame chicken, and garlic fried chicken. \n\nThe combo fried rice was pretty good, but ended up drinking about 6 glasses of water due to the MSG and sodium content. You'd think that the cook spent his better years in the French Foreign Legion in the Sahara eating salt tablets and developed a taste for them. \n\nThe sesame chicken had a good flavor and a thick brown sweet sauce. I liked it a lot until it got cool and the sauce looked (with that stringy consistency) more like glue. You think I'm kidding? I'm not.\n\nGarlic fried chicken was bad. Just bad. It was like an over roasted dried out half chicken with some dried garlic pieces sprinkled on top. No spices, no flavor, no good. \n\nWe then got all kinds of lip from the waitress when we asked if they could change the channel on the TV from college football, to the Suns game. They made it into this big deal that the \"customers\" wanted to see the football game. Yeah right, it was University of West Virginia Vs. University of Connecticut! I would have believed it if it was a local team....\n\nIt's better than a 1 star joint, but only because it's borderline edible. To be avoided.","This restaurant is located in the Chinese Cultural Center and was the one restaurant that I had not been to. So after some shopping at one of the shops, we stepped in to have dinner.\n\nWe stepped in and asked for a seat for two. We were seated immediately. The place was decorated nicely and a lady playing the piano made for great ambiance.\n\nWe looked at the menu briefly and ordered our drinks, an appetizer, a soup and two main dishes. The drinks came out promptly and so did the rest of the meal. My goodness everything we ordered was very tasty.\n\nThe waiter service itself however was not even close to the decor and food. He never introduced himself, and although he took our order, our food itself was brought out by a kitchen person.\n\nAfter we ordered our waiter really never came back asking if we needed anything else, except to give us our check at the end and that was after the person I was dining with got up and asked a different waiter for it.\n\nIt's amazing how a place with great food, decor, and ambiance can mess it all up by crappy waiter service.","I love Dim Sum, my favorite Chinese dish.\n\nWhen Golden Buddha first open, they have excellent Dim sum. I went there many times, I tell my friend how good it is, But now,  they change cook, taste more like  week old left over. Rumor has it, they change cook every few month, so Quality of cooking change. (not sure if that is true, but that is what I was told.)\nMy advice is; when you walk in the door and the place is pack, = Good Cook. if the place is bare = bad cook. leave immediately. don't waste your money.","If you just \"want\" dim sum, go here. If you are \"craving\" dim sum, go elsewhere (take a 5 hour drive west to neighboring state, California).\n\nAnyway, I've been visiting Golden Buddha in the noontime for roughly 2 years now. I believe they moved from their original site (7th St. & Osborn), formerly \"China Doll.\" Relocation brought along better atmosphere and smiling faces. This does not mean, better dim sum. But since we are in Phoenix, I will settle for what they have to offer. \n\nBe mindful of the dim sum tab. It's itemized high-medium-low. \n\nShaomai can be found as combinations of pork/mushroom, shrimp, or shark fin (which should not be confused as true shark bits, as the shaomai is prepared to look like a shark's fin). These picks are okay...perhaps on a better day shao mai will be served in less-rigid, or fresher wrappers. Potstickers are okay as well, just the usual scallion and pork, and dry wrapper. The baby pork ribs in light black bean sauce and jalapenos is alright, but sometimes lacks in taste. Tripe is also served in its bare minimum...so if you enjoy the texture and flavor of tripe, try this with its clear sauce and thinly sliced carrots and celery.  \nBuche (that's what I call it), or fried sesame balls are also available, although if you wait until dessert, they will also be a bit stiff. There are a few other things that may be \"spotted\" but are not worth mentioning. \n\nDon't order from their lunch menu, as you can find these over-salted dishes at Panda Express anyway. \n\nOverall, dim sum at Golden Buddha is a place to go if you are around the vicinity and feel like having something apart from the usual fast food. However, discriminating palates- beware.","Not impressed with this place at all. This was not the friendliest place around, maybe because of the language barrier (most or all were clearly native Chinese speakers), or maybe just the attitude of the employees.\n\nI ordered the sweet and sour chicken lunch, which came with the typical egg drop soup, crab rangoon, and egg roll. The soup was ok - maybe it's just me, but I prefer a real spoon to the scoop that they gave me. The egg roll was tiny and not that great, and the crab rangoon was ok, but maybe a little undercooked. The chicken wasn't bad, but nothing special, as was the rice and other stuff on the plate.\n\nOverall, this was just not my kind of Chinese place.","Disappointing.  Mediocre at best.  I am staying at the Aloft hotel in phoenix and ordered some delivery. I ordered a couple american chinese food staples: general tso's chicken, dumplings and hot&sour soup.  Soup had zero flavor, dumplings tasted freezer burned and processed.  General tso chicken was ehh. \n\nA lot of good reviews on here so it must be for eat in and for their dim sum.  Don't order delivery, you will be left hungry and unsatisfied.","Went there on Saturday for early lunch.  My wife did the dim sum, it was okay, we were both disgusted by the sugar cane shrimp; but the rest was good.  \n\nI ordered the chicken szechwuan, the waitress warned me it was \"spicy\" the reason I ordered it.  It came out delicious, but not what I would call spicy.  Overall its hard to find good Chinese in the valley and I would call this good without hesitation.","So I was referred to this place from the front desk of my hotel. I'm from SF so I'm coming from a place with really good chinese food. \n\nThe dim sum is just \"ok\" nothing for me to write home about. The one dish that I really liked was the chinese broccoli cooked with garlic sauce. Yum yum yum.  It's in a big bowl, not oily, not saucy, just really good. I think it's $7.50.  \n\nIt's a somewhat pricey and just like all chinese restaurants, it's not the cleanest.  The chair was filthy.  the dishes weren't all that great.  I wouldn't go back unless I want the chinese broccoli.  \n\nSo I went on a Sunday and it was not crowded at all. There's not a huge asian population  in Phoenix (not that I could tell) so I don't think there's a high demand for dim sum.  And also, I sooooooo felt like taking a pic of this, but a Mexican lady was pushing one of the dim sum carts. That is unheard of in SF.  This is a mainly mandarin restaurant and the dim sum places I go are usually cantonese.  Not a big deal though since the dishes look the same. \n\nDude, there was a turtle in the fish tank that I saw as I left.  I hope they don't eat that!","A Premier Chinese Atmosphere,\nThe Chinese cultural center and Asian Garden produces an Asain atmosphere that can be recognized from the 202.  \n With Dim Sum served this location earns its respect from the local community.\n\nDim Sum tip,  You have to be smart with the Dim Sum ladies they look nice innocent but they are professional sales people that will sell you more dishes than you need before you know what to do.  \n\nI love the desserts here ask the server to see the dessert tray.","This restaurant has a bit of an identity crisis. It is in the Chinese cultural center, but serves Japanese beer (Kirin on tap!) and the live piano music is American pop. We had to ask for chopsticks.\n\nHaving said that, the service was professional. Our waiter held a hot appetizer for one of our party who was away from the table so that it would not be cold when he returned. We were asked frequently--and not too frequently--if things were ok both by our waiter and the manager/proprietor.\n\nThe food was ok-to-good. Fried shrimp egg rolls were dainty but yummy. Duck was tasty but very chewy. Kung-pao chicken was pleasantly spiced. Plenty of rice. A pitcher of ice water with lemon was left at the table. \n\nAtmosphere was also pleasant. Chairs comfortable, tables spaced well, restrooms large and clean...and there is indeed a large golden Buddha by the entrance.","I took a group of friends here and relatives other times. The place is consistently good for Dim-sum during lunch. It is typical Chinese and nothing fancy.\n\nWhat helps this place is the moat scenery.  3 stars for visiting here based on convenience since there are similar places in town.","Having grown up in Hong Kong and having eaten dim sum in London, NY, LA, SF and Vancouver (actually Richmond), I can confidently say I know my dim sum.\n\nGood selection of well-executed dim sum when the carts actually come around and there's anything left in it.  I'd give it 4 stars for food but the wait definitely detracted from the whole experience.\n\nI think the problem with Golden Buddha is that they can't handle the heavy flow on weekends.  There's not enough regular dim sum eaters like LA that can sustain a steady flow of diners throughout the week, forcing restaurants like Golden Buddha to depend heavily on extra part-time help on weekends.  \n\nDim sum takes serious skill so the chef still ends up doing most of the work.  When we looked into the kitchen, we saw a Chinese woman doing most of the cooking herself.  No wonder it took forever for a cart to come out and when it does, it's swarmed on by a pack of vultures.\n\nIf you're willing to eat at a more simply decorated place with a smaller menu, I'd highly recommend China Chan.  It's much more relaxed - usually no wait on weekends.  An experienced chef makes all the dim sum himself so the menu's much shorter but all the classics are on it.  Anything steamed is made to order so is very fresh.","Situated in the Chinese Cultural Center near the SkyHarbor Airport, this was another pleasant find. All I had was the Dim Sum menu, and I would say this is the best you're gonna get in Phoenix. Still worth the stop to get your Dim Sum fix. The cart ladies were pleasant and very happy to converse with me in Cantonese. Only downside was the chicken sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaves, naw mei gai, was way overcooked, and mushy.","Do you want to eat Chinese Food in an elegant environment on a Friday night in Phoenix? \n\nBe entertained by classic, quiet standards being played live on a piano while you dine?\n\nAre you 50 years old and Caucasian?\n\nThen the Golden Buddha is the place for you! \n\nIts in the Chinese Cultural Center Mall on 44th, and a popular weekend spot for Dim Sum. For a DIm Sum starved Valley of the Sun, Golden Buddha's is decent. \n\nFor dinner, though, it is awfully Americanized and not very authentic Chinese. But with a bunch of American customers coming for dinner, what do you expect? They probably think they are getting \"real Chinese\" food by going to the Chinese Mall, but then again, they are used to PF Chang's or Stix normally in their neighborhood, so this is a step up.\n\nThe best thing about this place is the decor, which is clean and nice, with a Hong Kong Junk boat design covering the ceiling from the bar into the dining room. The next best thing is the Piano interludes on weekend nights. The service is next, which is a little overly eager to remove your plate, and the last thing is the food. \n\nThey do give decent portions. I ordered Guo Teh (potstickers) and got 6 fat ones. But they weren't served with the usual soy, chili oil and vinegar, but a soy and green onions mixture. The Mapo Tofu was ok, as they used a nice silky tofu, which was nice, but no green onions, and sliced black mushrooms instead, which I like, but not in this dish.\n\nCome here for the ambiance and music in the evenings, or on the weekend days for Dim Sum.","Decent dim sum, especially to be found in the middle of the desert. Sadly, the best food I've had in Phoenix.","This place is a little difficult for me to review.  I was staying at the Hampton Inn across the street and this is the closest restaurant so off I went.\n\nI walked in and the owner or manager met me at the door and asked \"how many\"?\n\nI told him I wanted to order take out and handed me a menu and pointed to the waiting area which was covered in newspapers.  I chose to go to the bar, order a glass of wine, and peruse the menu.\n\nThe drinks are expensive but I didn't think the food was.  Less than $10 for my Mongolian Chicken which came with white sticky rice and a fortune cookie.  When ordering I asked if I could have fried rice instead of white rice but was told \"no\".  Most places allow this for a nominal fee.\n\nFine by me.  Give the white rice.  Food was prepared and their to-go boxes were a lot better than the standard white Chinese \"to go\" boxes.  They also included the plastic-ware, napkin, and soy sauce, which a lot of places forget.\n\nLooking around I found a whole lot of goodness along with a couple disappointments.  Most notably the newspaper strewn about and behind the bar, to the right were a lot of boxes stacked in an unsightly fashion.  I could have been a little more presentable in my opinion.\n\nI peeked into the dining room because I wanted to see if the piano music was piped in or live.  It was live which was very nice. Also, the dinning room looked very nice and cozy.\n\nAs I was leaving the same man who greeted me upon entering made sure to wish me a good evening.  My initial impression of the man was that he was surly and testy but that's just how he comes off.\n\nThe food was very good.  The Mongolian sauce was mixture of sweet with spice and the chicken and vegetables all tasted fresh.","My husband and I went there Saturday, the service was great!  Our friends were going to be late so they told us to start.  And start we did!\nThey were serving Dim Sum, something we had never tried, so glad we did, it was wonderful, hubby wouldn't do the chicken feet, but I think next time I will, it looked very good.\nOur friends showed up and ordered their food, and ate all of it, they said that usually they take food home, but it was so good they had to eat all of it!\nWe will be going back very soon!","Let's see, over 50... check \nold white man...........check \neats dinner ...............check \nlistens to the piano  check \n\nwow this must be the place for me, I mean after all it is in a Chinese mall, no make that a Chinese Cultural Center. How could I possibly have discerning taste with such trickery to get me here to eat. \nDude if you are going to rate a restaurant no need to degrade others with your arrogance. \nFool is my review of wanugee N. \n\nNow on the restaurant. The last time we were here the food was not good, the piano was too loud and the waitress had a real attitude. IT won't keep me from going back as I have had good meals and wait service too. \n\nBack to wanugee N. I do not expect any place in Phx. to have authentic Chinese food, by that I mean the street food one finds in China. \nBut I do expect what I fork in to my mouth is worth what I am going to fork over in cost. Even an old white guy like me can tell the difference between good and bad food. No matter what it is called.","Okay so Ive been glum the past few days as I have an impending birthday. Every year this time I get all down in the dumps.. not that I'm not happy with my life cause life is good. Its more like getting further away from my youth and closer to being well, old. All of my grandparents were crotchety, sourpuss drama queens.. is that my fate? Can I break the mold or am I to going to be a crotchety sourpuss?\n\nSo as I contemplate and figure out what I'm going to do with my birthday baggage I decide to squash it with food. All weekend Ive been eating out and having a good time. This is one of the few times outside of a vacation where I will live it completely and to the near of sheer gluttony. So why not dim sum? \n\nIve chowed much dim sum in my 36 years of earthen wear.. of course some good and some bad. I have never been to a place where every dish was great.. Golden Buddha is no exception to this.. they do the basics well enough and have enough funky cool Asian style to keep me interested in returning. The carts around 1130 flow well but around noon it' s full blown freeway action! In fact there might be some road kill in there based on some of the looks on that last steam cart.. \n\nMe and 3 others who were feeling my pain ordered 14, count them, 14 different dishes. One of my friends is from Georgia and had never had dim sum but he is so courageous and unflinching that he was just a blast. Just the shot in the arm to get me out of my funk. I remember the first time I had dim sum.. my eyes wide open, nostrils flared and excited to see what was under the next steamer lid. That was him today.. one exciting thing after the next.. he was even willing to try chicken feet but this is one of those dishes not done very well here. \n\nMy friend took me back to a time where I was younger and less experienced. He looked up to me to guide him through the noodles, bao and sui mai.. like a big brother.. I'm privileged that I could show him something new and exciting and he was so into it! So instead of feeling sorry for myself I felt experienced and useful.. that there is something I can give back to others.. that its not all about me and me aging but about what can be shared with others.\n\nThere is so much more to do, give and feel in this short time we are here.. and Ill do it to, one bite at a time.","The best to be found in land locked Arizona.  My favorite sticky rice is here.  They have dim sum every day, but not a huge selection, though you can order off the menu.  I think it is much bigger on the weekends.  I'm just happy I can get my fix 7 days a week.  Beautiful gardens to walk through, with fish ponds, and a 99 market next door!","I ate at Golden Buddha a few weeks ago.  We ate at the restaurant after a day at the zoo with our 4 year old and had a blast.  The piano bar played tunes for my daughter and the staff was more than accommodating.  The general tso chicken was better than anything I can get in Tucson.  The soup was chocked full of fresh, read FRESH, not canned, vegetables.  All in all, I was very satisfied with the meal and the service.  Plus the decor is very nice, clean and cheery. \n\nEat at Golden Buddha.","For those who gave this place low marks, forgive me. I really like this place. Now I haven't tried various dim sum places so I'm reserving the right to downgrade the place as needed. The variety of food is plentiful, and the carts just keep on coming. I love the steamed pork buns, and the shiu mai (not sure if I spelled that correctly). Yesterday, my favorite pick was the deep fried rolls of taro and shrimp. YUM! I have never ordered from their menu so I can only talk about their dim sum. My friends and I try to go eat dim sum almost every Sunday. It's a cheap way to try new foods, and if you don't like it, well.. you can get away with pushing it aside with minimal guilt. Give it a try! You might be surprised.","I like Golden Buddha, have taken many friends there for Dim Sum.  \nTry not to \"hit\" the dumpling cart to heavy; otherwise cannot finish it to the dessert cart (LOL).\nLove the jasmine tea and the staff willing to help you if you do not understand the what each item is.\nSingapore Rice Noodles a favorite, along with any of the shrimp dumplings; also the broccoli and green beans.\nOnly wish that the carts with eggplant stuffed with shrimp or green peppers with shrimp were not on \"heated\" carts; by the time it gets to you the food is cold.\nOnly concern is that went on 22MAY2010 at 1:30PM; there was a closed sign due to electricity???\nREVISED: 26MAY2010 - called this evening - looks like they are back open again.","I've been to the Golden Buddha on several occasions and it is my favorite, by far, for honest Chinese food. \nWhile I've sampled everything from their vegetarian to their beef, I love their mandarin chicken. More recently, I was delighted to relive the wonders of their Kung Pao Chicken and Beef with Broccoli. \nI absolutely love the egg drop soup and mini crab rangoons that come with the meal.","The very first time I went to Golden Buddha was with my BFF and it was our first dim sum experience. Little did I know this would forever change my life and eating experiences. Although I must admit that first time was a bit awkward.\n\nGB wisely takes reservations which was wonderful (even though it wasn't crazy busy). Our assorted dim sum plates were flavorful and fresh. And the carts seemed to be in constant rotation so we were never too far from a good selection.\n\nWhat really helps GB is its location. The Cofco Center is an experience in itself, where one can have herbs specially blended, select a fresh member of marine life to take home and cook or browse through a store with one of the largest selections of Buddhas and hand fans I've experienced outside of San Francisco.","I've been to Golden Buddha a few times and have not been disappointed. \n\nThey have a LARGE selection of Dim Sum and if you're not careful you can get carried away.\n\nTry and get there early and you'll get the best and most fresh selection.\nMake sure you walk around the garden when you're done.","Probably the most comprehensive Chinese menu in the Valley.  Pick from well over 100 dishes, but if you want the best order the Peking Duck.  Everything else is very good, but without a wow factor.  You'll see lots of Chinese people in this massive restaurant, which probably means they're doing a fine job in the kitchen.","I very much enjoyed eating here. Food was great. Fairly fast service. Wasn't expensive either for the 4 of us.","Golden Buddha has GREAT dim sum.  Their prices are reasonable and the staff is very polite wheeling their little carts.  I tend to go on the weekend because there is more selection but they do dim sum throughout the week.  They also have some very authentic dishes on the menu for those who are more of the adventurous types.  Be sure to say hello to the turtles the next time you go.","This place in the Chinese Cultural Center has a very pretty and elegant bar area. I was pleased to learn that they had some very reasonable and delicious happy hour snacks. This is a good place for a Pina Colada. I had one by myself along with some dumplings and fried shrimp appetizer. Sadly I never brought anyone else here with me. It was happy hour heaven but you know? A lot of my friends in AZ pretty much hang out in one neighborhood or another and nobody I know really lives close to the Buddha.\nThe airport is pretty close by. This might be a good pre-flight send-off location.","I have had dim sum in New Orleans and Phoenix (not SF), and this is about equal to the best of New Orleans as far as flavor.\nAs for ambiance, today was a good day. I've had dim sum here about a dozen times, and have had very good service and quality 90% of the time, including weekends. I have had bad days here, but since today was good, I'll rate accordingly. It's closer to a 4.5, but since I can't give half-stars, I rounded up.\nDon't expect me to give these the right names, but... I was less than impressed with the bbq pork balls. They tasted too much like honey and the beef was minimal. The bbq sauce tasted bottled. Outside of that, their herbal hot tea is delicious even on a hot day.\nThe shu mai were very good, and the shrimp in a spinach dumpling was fantastic. A definite don't miss is their sticky rice in lotus leaf. It's among the best I've had anywhere. Just be careful; you'll find bones in it every once in a while. Go for any of their steamed dumplings; they're very flavorful. As others have said, I love the Chinese broccoli, but you'll only find it on the carts on weekends. Otherwise order it off the menu.\nToday (11:30 lunch) the carts came around often, and everything except the pork buns was piping hot and fresh. By the way, despite the price increases, even the sticky rice was considered a medium size entree, and the two of us eating there escaped with a bill under $20 and we were done in under 30 minutes.\nI strongly recommend the dim sum here, whether you've had it a million times or have never had it before. You usually won't be disappointed.","I don't really understand the poor reviews on this place.....maybe it depends on the day you go? We went on a Sunday, it was crazy busy, but service was great! (of course, my view of customer service is a little different then the rest... I used to live on an island where you were just happy to find what you were looking for, let alone expect good customer service) Anyways, our server was very sweet! Always had a smile on her face. The carts served us promplty and none of the food was cold. They always had whatever we wanted (I hate having to wait for the next cart).\n\nNow, as for the actual dim sum and food.......holy cow, to die for! So flavorful and fresh!! The broccoli makes you sing...and the wine noodles, make you cry. You leave with very weird mixed emotions, but mostly a happy belly full of yummy food.\n\nIn my opinion, this is the best dim sum I have been able to find in Phx. I'm ditching my previous spot (Mekong Palace) and will be back to Golden Buddha when the dim sum monster strikes again!"],"type":["Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low

to eat and a local told me this was \"the best pizza in the city.\"  I got a plain slice and a pepperoni slice. Possibly the worst pizza I have ever eaten.  This wouldn't even qualify as pizza in North Jersey.  I ate half of the plain slice because I was starving....then threw both in the garbage.  \n\nIf this is really the best pizza in Pittsburgh... wow.","I ordered from Pizza Parma out of storm necessity. I ordered a chicken parmigiana \"hoagie\", which was dry and luke warm. The potato bacon soup was like something out of a can, except the chunks of potato were hard and undercooked..all pretty nasty and overly salty.\n\nNever order from them.","Zero stars. Came in 10 mins before close. Female manager on duty asked for $100 in exchange for a pizza. When we refused she said she could not serve us because her employees had been working since 9am..,it is currently 2:00 am... Sounds pretty illegal to me","Average pizza.

hotel and not really having eaten much all day, I was hungry.\n\nThe service was terrible....no one knew what they were doing so it took 10 minutes to get a freaking slice of pizza and then when said pizza came it was NASTY.\n\nMy husband once got a pizza in Milwaukee where they put Kraft singles on it as cheese and Pizza Parma is just behind that for worst pizza ever.","Looking for a quick bite to eat and a local told me this was \"the best pizza in the city.\"  I got a plain slice and a pepperoni slice. Possibly the worst pizza I have ever eaten.  This wouldn't even qualify as pizza in North Jersey.  I ate half of the plain slice because I was starving....then threw both in the garbage.  \n\nIf this is really the best pizza in Pittsburgh... wow.","I ordered from Pizza Parma out of storm necessity. I ordered a chicken parmigiana \"hoagie\", which was dry and luke warm. The potato bacon soup was like something out of a can, except the chunks of potato were hard and undercooked..all pretty nasty and overly salty.\n\nNever order from them.","Zero stars. Came in 10 mins before close. Female manager on duty asked for $100 in exchange for a pizza. When we refused she said she could not serve us because her employees had been working since 9am..,it is currently 2:00 am... Sounds pretty illegal to me","Average pizza. But with ten guys working - and not much business at the moment - it still took twenty minutes to get a slice of pepperoni. I'll walk across the street next time.","My butthole hasn't been right for days, nor my stomach. \n\nWe ordered in because we all had a long day and were set to have a family movie night.\n\nA pizza and hoagie. \n\nThe hoagie wasn't anything to run and go scream from the rooftops about but the pizza was covered in little ass ruining intestinal demons and this I am nearly sure of.\n\nI had to be talked out of sending pizza Parma a bill for several rolls of toilet paper.\n\nBe weary of the pizza, distrustful actually.\n\nYour butthole will thank me for it!","Hubby and I dropped in after a hellish morning at the Social Security office. Hubby loves pizza so we made a stop.\n\nPizza wan't bad, it was actually pretty decent. But the place was disgusting and the cashier was incredibly rude.","I eat this pizza all the time when downtown, usually when running around at events like First Night or the Gallery Crawls...not the best pizza I have ever had in my life, but it's not bad!  And I haven't ever gotten sick from it.  Just wanted to offer a different opinion.","PIzza Parma's decent tasting mega-big-2ft-long hot sausage hoagie was let down by the piss poor attitude of the staff, the lack of cleanliness of the tables and floor, the out-of-order red door restroom, the bright yellow for no-explicable reason walls. \n\nThe large color-striped 80's retro tables and green chairs have come back in style but this win is purely accidental and achieved only by laziness and lack of renovation.\n\nThat is all.","My fiance & I have lived in downtown Pittsburgh for over a year + now & this place is fabulous. \nMy sweetie LOVES LOVES LOVESSS pizza & we order from here a ton.  We haven't ordered anything here that wasn't super tasty.\nThe shop is small & the decor is super bright which makes you want to get in & out quickly but who the hell eats in there anyways. ... you're grabbing your order & running.","I'm glad I listened to my friend's recommendation and not some of these bad reviews. We're just in town for the night and wanted something delivered to our hotel. They said it would take an hour, which I expected on Super Bowl Sunday right at game time, but it was here in less than half an hour. \n\nThe pizza was delicious! Just the right balance of cheese and a tasty sauce, generous with the toppings, and a nicely crispy crust but not too thin.","This place has great service! My best friend and I got 2 custom orders and the older guy in back came out to the register to take our orders personally.  I assume he's either the cook, owner, or both. We ordered 2 cheeselss pizzas; a lot of places mess this up. Pizza Parma however, makes great cheeseless pizza. Our personal pizzas were nice and toasty, not over nor undercooked, and it was not dried out at all! There was more than enough sauce mmmmmmmmm.","My fiance & I have lived in downtown Pittsburgh for over a year + now & this place is fabulous. \nMy sweetie LOVES LOVES LOVESSS pizza & we order from here a ton.

I guess you can't believe everything your parents tell you right?  \n\nSo going in here, I was thinking, great...mom's goulash!  What was set in front me looked NOTHING like what I was used to.  It was a mish mosh of veggies,noodles, gravy and some random unidentifiable food items.  I usually eat whatever is put in front of me, so I wasn't scared to dive it.  Sadly, I just didn't like it.  I thought it was actually not very appetizing at all.  I know, I know, this is like \"world famous\" goulash, but I was NOT into it!  \n\nWhat I was into was the German Potato Salad.  I love it, and honestly, I feel like I never get the same version of it anywhere in the Burgh.  This was a no frills version, with scallop sliced potatoes and a thick vinegar sauce.  Maybe a bit too much, but not enough for me to eat it all!  \n\nWould I go back? If someone else really wanted to go there, but I wouldn't suggest it nor would I go on my own.  Oh well, on to the next one right?","This used to be the best German food in town. I have seen a gradual decline in the food over the past several years. The gravies have changed and the Max's Goulash (one of my favorite dishes) has a different sauce (strangely dessert sweet) and change in the protein. The sides are still great, but the food used to be so much better.","The goulash was (sickeningly) sweet and the bread pudding wasn't sweet at all.  But the atmosphere is kind of cool.  And the prices are downright cheap.","After hearing Hofbrauhaus-haters say that Max's Allegheny Tavern is the only place to go in Pittsburgh for German food, my husband and I decided to finally try the restaurant this afternoon.\n\nWe were seated in little booths right next to the bar. They were cozy, but the seats reminded me of old fashioned church pews. Our waitress soon brought us a little basket of four rolls with butter, sauerkraut relish, and apple butter. Though I liked the different varieties of bread, it was nothing special. The relish and apple butter were a nice touch though.\n\nOur waitress was busy with both waiting tables and tending the bar, but she managed to check on us pretty frequently. Our food also came out relatively promptly. I order the Wiener Schnitzel with Potato Pancakes and Spatzle on the side. The Wiener Schnitzel was amazing -- by far the best I've ever had! The veal was tender and the fried surface was perfectly crispy. However, the sides sadly did not match this main dish. The Potato Pancakes were oddly bitter, and I did not enjoy them with either the sour cream or applesauce. I only ate two or three bites and completely stopped eating them. (I must add that Hofbrauhaus's potato pancakes are delicious and something that I order every time that I go there.) I also did not enjoy the Spatzle, but I am accustomed to eating cheese Spatzle.... So I may be reviewing this harshly since I'm just not used to plain Spatzle, but in my opinion, it was terribly bland and watery.\n\nOverall, Max's Allegheny Tavern served one incredible item (Wiener Schnitzel), but everything else was merely mediocre. Because of this, I really don't plan on returning to the restaurant again any time soon. I'll be sticking with the fun environment and overall good food at Hofbrauhaus, actually.","I really thought I'd never be back.  The goulash I had was so so gross.  But then,  was roped in by some friends who were doing a Sunday brunch book club.  Of course I couldn't miss out on tantalizing conversation... so I obliged.  \n\nI really had no clue what they offered for brunch options, but quickly learned they have a a pretty decent size brunch buffet.  I'm not below buffets at all, it's the fat kid in me!  Most things still looked a little questionable to me, but I went for the big ticket items.  Make your own omelets, potato pancakes and dessert.  I'd hit up the buffet again, but still be hasty to check out the regular menu again.  \n\nThe omelet was made right in front of you, so I added cheese, mushrooms, peppers, tomatoes and onions.  I was super excited about it because it was the size of a football.  Sadly, it was pretty tasteless.  I don't think they added any salt or pepper to the egg mix, so it came out really bland, despite loading up on ingredients.  \n\nBut the potato pancakes... I could survive on them forever.  They were amazeballs!  Add some sour cream and I was in potato patch heaven!  I had to keep myself from getting more because of the other thing I loaded up on... dessert.  \n\nThe desserts looked unassuming, but they were also awesome.  I had a smattering of delectable bites.  The scones were so moist and tasty.  I had to stop myself from taking more than 20.  I also had some carrot cake, brownies, cookies among other things I inhaled and didn't pay attention too.  Should I be embarrassed?  Probably.  But I don't care because it was darn good!","I took my boyfriend, a German-food enthusiast, to Max's Allegheny Tavern last night. We had been looking forward to a night out together for a while. \n\nI think the food was good, but it's hard to say, because all I could focus on was the LOUD -- and I mean LOUD -- woman seated behind my boyfriend and me.\n\nHer profanity-laden discussion with her dining partners was so bad that for the first time in my life, I turned around and asked a fellow restaurant patron to take the volume down a few notches. \n\nThe restaurant was almost empty; I have no idea why the host chose to seat a loud party of five next to a couple having a quiet dinner.","FYI: New happy hour specials are awful. Just awful. Sorry guys, as much as i love you   I've got to put my food down somewhere. Even raising the prices on all of the apps to 3.99 would've been better than taking the pierogie (aka potato pockets) special off all together. \n\nWon't be back.","I've been here once because this was an easy place to meet for dinner with a friend. I enjoyed eating here well enough.\n\nI'm honestly not a die-hard fan of German food, although I guess that wouldn't have mattered: a peak at the menu beforehand revealed that this place's menu is mostly Americanized - proof of this is the fact that my salad was topped with French fries (only in Pittsburgh...). Trust me, even if you don't really like German food, there'll at least be a sandwich you'll like here.\n\nThinking about my usual \"overall\" summary, I have to say this place wasn't bad and served as a reasonable place to meet - the beer menu looked nice from what I saw and the atmosphere was pretty cozy and even nostalgic and homely - but man, the dining options really weren't that extraordinary. I'm still torn as to how to feel about its menu, because on the one hand obviously it being Americanized meant even I could find something to enjoy, but on the other I feel bad for the people who do like German food and may not be getting what they hope for. \n\nIt wasn't bad enough that I'd say don't try it and see - just understand it may not be exactly what you expect.","Authentic German fare. German beer. Best soft pretzels in Pittsburgh. Reasonable prices. Friendly service. Very fair portion sizes. You'll be taking a box home. The basement is nice. But sometimes used for private events. Has a very cozy \"grotto\" feel to it.","Want a taste of the old ethnic communities of Pittsburgh? Go to Max's Allegheny Tavern. German never tasted sooo nice!\n\nMenu Fav: Potato Pancake Reuben. Forget the bread and wrap your lips around sweet potato pancakes and loads of corned beef. Try the hot potato salad too.","This place is great for brunch on Sunday! The service is great and the food is delicious. I always leave stuffed and happy.","I have a friend that loves this place, and I have been told it's the best German food in Pittsburgh so I had to give it a try.\n\nI had the Roasted Loin of Pork Stubenkuchen Style with German Style Potato Salad, and Sauerkraut. Everything was really good. The Pork was delicious and that mushroom gravy that they put on it was nothing short of amazing. I want a whole bucket of the stuff to put on everything. The Sauerkraut was interesting featuring shredded pork mixed in. The german potato salad was good but was pretty much what I expected. \n\nTheir draft  beer Selection left a little bit to be desired but featured 5-8 beers many of them popular german style beers. \n\nI got a good idea what this place is all about and I have to say that I will be back for more.","I ordered the Roast Pork loin with Apple raisin dressing, sauerkraut, and German potatoes. Oh yeah... Right Choice! Took a little longer than usual as there was a Large Party of 16 that ordered Just prior to us. Happy to say the waitress took Great care of us, plenty of rolls, drink refills, etc. as we waited. Apple Strudel for the Final Act. So Good, I forgot to take a picture. lol","Diane is awesome, i used to live in PA and\nmoved to CA and this is a great place for a beer,\ncheap food and good friends.\nI miss this place.\nOne of my favorites places back home in PA!","I've been going to Max's off and on for 31 years (I KNOW!  How could someone as young as I am been going there for THAT long?)    And I am not from nor ever lived in the North Side!\n\nThat said...i have always loved the food and the place.   I was great the first time and was great last night!   Most of the mains can be recommended without reservation....last night I had roasted pork with dressing and gravy.  It was deliscious!    As for sides....I ALWAYS have potato pancakes and sweet and sour cabbage.  (Because of my eastern european background I am partial to both cabbage and potatoes.   Do not be afraid of the cabbage unless you dislike sour! \n\nWe didn't have dessert, but did have beer and drinks.   They have a nice selection.\n\nMy only complaint was that the food was slow to come out.   It was a busy Friday night and I wasn't going anywhere so I had anover beer.   No big problem.\n\nGive Max's a try.....it might make your favorite like it did mine!","I have a confession to make........the thing I like most about Max's is their bread!!! They are free....they are fresh made....hot and soft...different kinds....and so so delicious!\nI'm not a big fan of German food, but it's just my personal taste. The portions are large and atmosphere is very relaxing and casual. I like it.","Our first stop in Pittsburgh, what a great start! Had a couple of yuenglings, a warm, salty yummy soft pretzel and a big ole plate of German goodness in da tummy!\n\nThe Peasant Platter had knock wurst, weisswurst and a pork chop on top of heap of sauerkraut...with potato pancakes, spaetzel and a basket of baked breads!  So.much.food.  And oh soooo good!\n\nThe bar is cool, staff is really nice and I believe they offer their patrons a free ride to and from on game days!","We (my fiance and I) went out for a pseudo-couples' date with our good friends, Sara and Thom, to Max's to introduce them to some of the most authentic German food in da Burgh. Where most people associate Hofbrauhaus with the ultimate German beer-hall experience, I prefer Max's for the quieter, less raucous environs. (At least when it's not Oktoberfest)\n\nWe'd been there once before and immediately fell in love with the place. I (still) keep raving about the Sausage and Cheese platter. They've got some good Gouda. The Potato Pockets (pierogies) were OK -- I'd take some Pierogies Plus or Forgotten Taste over Max's, but that's just me.\n\nThe spaetzel was to die for, however. It's like a German Mac n' Cheese. And boy, do I love me some Mac n' Cheese. It literally melts in your mouth with its' ooey-gooey-ness.\n\nDrink-wise, I tried their German lager and Thom tried the sampler. Thom is a beer enthusiast. For around eight bucks, you get a GOOD amount of beers to try -- they are not some dinky little shot glass samples, either. Thom had some trouble near the end finishing it...it was so much beer. Bob had a Captain and ginger-ale...in a king-size goblet. Goblets are the ONLY way to serve adult bevvies.\n\nFor dinner, I had the pork loin over an apple-raisin gravy/bread concoction. The pork loin was flavorful and tender, and quite delicious. Sara had the sauerbraten and seemed to enjoy it. Bob's burger was ginormous and looked extra tasty.\n\nWe finished it off with the Apple Fritters. Now, these fritters aren't for the faint of heart. And they aren't your average dinky small sized portions, either. You get two huge deep fried apple fritters, covered in vanilla ice cream. One person CANNOT eat the whole serving. You must, I repeat MUST share them. If you attempt to eat the whole plate yourself, you will have flavor explosion, followed by severe heartburn. But damn, are they GOOD.\n\nOur visit ended up totaling 2 hours. One thing, though...please fix your outdoor sign. Usually it shines out like a red and blue beacon in the night for people to find their way there, but on Wednesday, it was out. Driving there, I got confused on where it exactly was (but I had a general idea, as I had been there before.).","Max's is my parents' favorite restaurant when they're in town visiting me. Good, solid food with a great deal of [German] variety. I love the German beer flights (i.e., beer sampler) and the atmosphere is funny - a bit like your grandmother's parlor. The bread that comes with entrees is delicious (pumperknickel + others), and their cherry sauer kraut is delicious as well.\n\nThe food is good, but you must be careful with certain dishes. One of the schnitzels that comes with carrots/peas is clearly bedecked in carrots & peas that were recently frozen. German food isn't exactly known for its vegetables, so I let it slide but I always remember not to order that dish when I'm there.","I have been coming to Max Allegheny Tavern since I was still in my mother's womb.  But seriously.  This place has been an institution for my family, and I really love it here.  I feel like this is some of the only German food in Pittsburgh, and I think it represents fairly well.  My thoughts:\n\nBrunch Buffet- I love the Sunday brunch buffet more than life.  Omelette station, German and American breakfast and lunch foods, and lots and lots of beautiful, delicious, and decadent desserts.  It's heaven on Earth.  There is usually a decent selection of meats, and the potato pancakes are almost always featured.  They've changed it a bit over the years, but I still love this buffet.\n\nAppetizers- My family loves the soft pretzels.  They are so yummy and buttery, but a bit heavy if you are going to eat your entire meal.  So make sure to share.\n\nMeals-  I, personally, have never had a bad meal here.  The sauasages of all varieties have been great.  The weinerschnitzel also great.  Sandwiches all good as well.  I really like the cheesy spaetzle dish that is just like macaroni and cheese but with spaetzle noodles!  I don't get too crazy and order anything complicated, though.\n\nSides-  I love love love their sides.  I could live on the spaetzle and potato pancakes.  Don't pass the sides up!\n\nDessert:  Also love their desserts.  There is a chocolate chocolate cake that they heat up with homemade whipped cream that is TO DIE FOR.  Not so shockingly, the apple strudel is wonderful as well.\n\nBesides the food, the servers are always very friendly and efficient.  There is also ample street parking, which is really nice.  Definitley check this place out if you have not yet.","How can there be no reviews of Max's Allegheny? This north side German food institution in Pittsburgh has been around for years and years and has menus that tell you so. They also tell you the story of the north side of Pittsburgh, which I also found interesting. The place itself has a lot of character and looks like it's seen a lot of years there. It's a little weathered, but definitely homey and sturdy.\n\nRandy S. and I headed there post Tazza D'Oro on a Sunday for brunch. It happened to be the same very Sunday the Pens were playing the Flyers in game 7, so all the waitresses were wearing Pens paraphernalia, which definitely added to the experience. On Sunday morning it has a brunch buffet with all the standards, plus a healthy dose of Germanic add ons like German farmers breakfast (eggs, sausage and gravy-ed potatoes), red cabbage, pork chops, sauerkraut and potato pancakes. \n\nThe brunch buffet is in a room with a giant tapestry of Neuschwanstein behind the guys at the omelet bar. If that's not rad, I don't know what is. We told the waitress we were going in, went and got back and sat down to find our two ice teas on the table in mason jars (always dope). \n\nThe food was just what you would expect in Pittsburgh: gut busting. It wasn't artisinal or fancy, healthy or particularly remarkable, but it was pretty fonking good and to eat that food in that restaurant really made me feel like I was in Pittsburgh. I can imagine all the food there would be of the 'hot and brown' category, in a positive way. And the waitress was probably the nicest on our drive from Dallas to CT. \n\nA really fun place, if showing it's age (though remorselessly).","Real german food (sausage, etc) and decent beer in family friendly atmosphere.\n\nThis is one of the good joints.","Max's is a great place for German food.  I've had several sandwiches, most of the appetizers and even the Sunday brunch (which has a good spread but can be hit or miss) -  though not all in one visit.\n\nI most recently took my Mom out for dinner using a Living Social deal I had.  Somehow, even though we have both been to Max's quite a few times before neither of us had ever seen the sampler platter option on their menu.  For just a bit more than the cost of the regular entrees, you can choose three entrees and two sides.  Obviously the portions of each selection are smaller than the individual meals, but the size is still generous and there were only a couple things not available for the sampler platter.  Between the two of us we selected six different items and four different sides to try and shared everything - and still had enough left for a full meal each the next day.  I can't even decide on my favorite of all the items we tried.  If you aren't sure about some of the entrees, this is a great way to see what you like.  I personally loved everything so much that I think my new go-to menu item from now on will be the sampler platter.  Not being forced to choose just one item is what living in America is all about.\n\nAll together I think our bill was around $35 (no alcoholic beverages consumed).  Some might consider this a tad pricey but the food is so good I usually don't mind the slightly higher cost.  Service has never been a problem for me in fact they've always been helpful when I have questions about the menu.  Full bar with numerous good beers on tap.  If you want German food in Pittsburgh, Max's is definitely the place to start.","Quaint spot on a back street in the North Side.  Very polite service, and delicious food at a great value.  Will definitely go back for authentic German fare.","One of my favorite north side haunts. Great to take visitors who need to understand what it means to be German in Pittsburgh. \n\nGet the soft pretzels. Get anything that comes with a potato pancake. Get the kielbasa. Get it all. You can't go wrong. \n\nOh, and the spaetzle. The spaetzle.......","Max's is one of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh.  It's the Kennywood Thunderbolt of Pittsburgh restaurants.  The Thunderbolt is considered one of the best rollercoasters in the country.  It's not the fastest, it's old, it doesn't have the biggest drops or flip you upside-down.  And yet it's great.  It's classic.  This is Max's Allegheny Tavern.  I'm sure there's better German food with cuter waitresses somewhere out there that doesn't have the decor aesthetics of your grandma's living room.  But who cares.  This place is just right.\n\nFinal note, I can't speak for the brunch buffet.  I went in there for the buffet once and decided that my money would be better spent on the menu.","This is my favorite restaurant on the Northside, possibly favorite restaurant in all of Pittsburgh.  I tell all my friends that this little restaurant is the best kept secret in Pittsburgh.  Max's is a quaint little German place that always has plenty of seating, even on Friday and Saturday nights.  The service is good.  The food is great, I always end up getting the potato pancakes.  If you are looking for a place to check out that isn't going to be as crowded and will be more \"authentic\" German food than other places you should definitely come to Max's!","German food and German beer served in a mason jar. Best in Pittsburgh. The history of the tavern and the friendly makes this wish me that I lived closer to Max's.","Tremendous selection of German dishes.  All the sausages come from a particular manufacturer in Wisconsin that uses 100 year old methods of making them (according to the menu).  I don't know if that's a good thing or not, but they taste terrific.  \n\nThe options for sides are as plentiful as the moan dishes and the hot bacon potato salad was awesome.  \n\nDefinitely recommend giving this a try.","Crap!  I can't believe that I missed a \"First to Review\" by just a matter of weeks.  Max's Allegheny Tavern has been a shining star and a \"must\" for my Pittsburgh rotation of places to visit.  Years ago, when I worked on the Northside for Heinz, I spent many a rowdy Friday night here in the basement with factory workers.  \n\nWhat's there to say?  It's a Northside institution and always has a mixed crowd that is super cool and friendly.  The bartenders are friendly and manage to remember my name and drink choice even though I'm here only a few times a year.  My Friday nights here must have made quite an impression!  I love the decor here, dark wood paneling with lots of stained glass, and the downstairs bar is where the naughty people hang.  Jukebox and room for dancing.  The food is very homey and very reasonably priced.  The German nachos are always worth ordering, and they are smothered with Gouda cheese.  The spatzle is also a creamy indulgent treat.  And for those seeking the real Deutsch culinary experience, they have a large variety of sausages and schnitzels.  So it's a sausage factory in more ways than one.","5 stars because I accept it for what it is.  Really good German comfort  food with killer drafts.  And the fact that the place has been there for forever makes it super cool.  I love the player piano and put a quarter in every time!  PS. the popcorn at the bar is sooooooooo good too.","Been coming to Max's for years. Very consistent. \n\nFood is always excellent, beer is always cold.\n\nPastrami and Swiss was great, but the meal of pork and apple/raisin sauce was out of this world.","Excellent German food.  I went in for an early lunch, the service was great.  Had a whole feast of great dishes.  The best sauerkraut i've ever had -- subtle, with caraway.  Sweet and sour cabbage, potato salad, spaetzle, a great weisswurst, and a great wheat beer on tap.","Best place in town.

waiter was to be found about ten minutes later they gave us our water and left again! It wasn't even busy! There were only TWO dim sum carts floating around somewhere. Then our waiter finally came around and took our orders of lunch entrees. The food was not even that good as the reviews that are posted on here. When we came up to pay, the bill was super overpriced. I will not be returning here, I am better off eating at Great Wall Cuisine.","If this place had zero stars I would have given them that ! Let me start off by saying I was so excited to read all great reviews so maybe I just came in on a off day? We walked in and were seated came over and asked if we wanted water or tea I guess they don't serve anything Else, Then we placed an order pork dumplings and sticky rice nasty! Then I asked if they served egg rolls they said they were out!!! they pushed their little carts around with hot plates that basically steam the food and is not fresh and what you get is soggy poor customer service we had to get up and look for someone to give us our tab so we could get the heck out of there are get some real food. It looked like it would be a great place for groups of people would not recommend if you are on mission for what you want and want to place an order but it could be a fun experience for some people.","You walk into a Chinese restaurant on a Saturday afternoon for dim sum and you expect the place to be PACKED.  Well, walking in to a pretty much empty dining room, it's a VERY CLEAR SIGN.  But my friend insisted and I was very hesitant for good reasons.  Another indicator, the majority of the patrons were NON Asian.  \n\nFood: You walk in and you see carts of the food by the entrance to the dining room.  Umm, I thought dim sum should come right off the steamer and into the carts and they roll it around, not sitting around.  The dim sum was garbage.  It had the typical selection, but at minimum.  \n\nService: It's ok.  But it doesn't make up for the horrible food.\n\nBottom line: NO WAY!  Stay away!","I've been here many times...Mother's Day with family, dim sum with book club, etc. But I will not go back again.  I stopped in to ask the owner about a donation or reduced price for a class of under-privileged kids that I volunteer with.  His reaction was to scoff and shoo me out the door while handing me his card and saying I could email him.  He turned his back and headed off to the messy newspaper-strewn table he haunts between guests arrivals.  Maybe he's a community-minded business owner, but then again, maybe he's not.  I'll be dining elsewhere.","Being from Chicago, we are used to getting authentic Chinese food all the time.  But when we first starting spending a lot of time in Scottsdale/Phoenix, we found it a challenge to get authentic Chinese food.  We were excited to find the Golden Buddha and have made many trips over the years all the way from the Troon North area to get our fix.  However, service has declined to the point where it is no longer worth the aggravation.  We went there last night for Chinese New Year and will never go back.  Granted they were very busy because of a lot of large tables there, but waiting almost an hour to get our food is not acceptable under any circumstance!  45 mins. into our wait, the waitress came back (after we flagged her down to ask about our food) and said one of the dishes we ordered was not available....after 45 mins.!!!! What makes the whole experience an unforgivable one is that the manager/owner is so indifferent and never apologized or offered a discount off the bill...nothing.  When we left, the same manager was at the piano singing in Chinese. Huh?  Other than Nee House in Scottsdale, the search goes on for a restaurant that serves authentic Chinese food closer to home.","I will NEVER go there again.  I reserved a table for a group of 16 people for 5:00 PM on Christmas Eve .  The person on the phone ( I believe the manager) repeatedly asked me to call ahead and give him an accurate head count since he said they'd be swamped that day.  I followed up with him twice.  \nWhen the first couple of us arrived, we had menus shoved in our faces immediately and told we \"Must order now.  Must order now\" because they were going to be busy later on.  The place was practically empty.  As each person arrived, they were treated the same way. \nWe rushed and placed our orders and then they brought out our checks WAY before we saw any sign of our food.  I have never in my life been treated so rudely by a restaurant.\nIt was utter chaos when the food started coming out while everyone struggled to get the correct dish they ordered.  One person didn't get her food until we were all just about finished eating. \nOne top of all that, the food wasn't even good.  I've had better Kung Pao Chicken at Panda Express!\nAfter being rushed through our meal, the place wasn't even half full by the time we left.  I thought being at the Cultural Center, this restaurant would be a sure thing but boy was I wrong.  Lovely way to spend Christmas Eve..","If you are looking a chinese restaurant to host a big party look some other than the Golden Buddah.  I recently attended a banquet at the Golden Buddah and I was shocked at the level of quality of food and service.  Of the 10 dishes served 4 were nearly inedible.  \n\nThere was a crab claw appetizer, most chinese restaurants prepare this dish by taking a crab claw surrounding it with ground shrimp, batter and then deep fry.  At Golden Buddah, the crab claw served was mostly batter.  \n\nThe shark fin soup served was mostly broth.  Shark fin is an expensive ingredient and most places usually use imitation shark fin, but come on at least put something in there so that I know I'm eating soup and not dirty sink water.  \n\nGinger scallion lobster is battered, fried, and then stir fried in a sauce with ginger and scallions.  The ginger scallion lobster served was over-cooked and dried out.  \n\nLastly, there was a steamed fish.  The fish was raw in the middle.   \n\nIt wasn't all bad, there was a crispy chicken with garlic dish that was pretty good, but out of 10 dishes 4 were bad, 5 were okay, and 1 was good.  \n\nDoes 4 bad dishes out of 10 warrant a one star rating?  Well it does when you factor in the service.  The soup, appetizer, and first entree arrived timely, but after that there was a 1 hour gap before we received the next dish.  The dishes were not served with accompanying white rice which I thought was odd.  We had to ask for it, and even the rice took a while to arrive.","I agree with Crystal C., that the dim sum isn't the greatest I've ever had. In fact, I am not sure if the meal was so tasty that it was memorable. I do remember the \"calamari\" was not really calamari, like you would think. It was presented more like a sweet and sour pork (so calamari with LOTS of breading) without any sauce. As a result, the dish was dry and salty.\n\nThe sticky rice was good (hard to mess up), the chicken feet were okay (needed more five spice powder), and the shumai was alright. The noodles were good, and I can see why the cart ran out after the first round. The diners were an equal mix of Asians and Americans. I would've preferred to see more Asians eating (as I am used to in a Chinatown and gives an indication of authenticity), but I do realize we're in Phoenix where the Asian population is not like San Francisco or Houston. \n\nThe meal came to about $30 for two, including jasmine tea. The carts are loud because they are made out of metal and roll on tile. I am also not used to staff members shouting what they have in their cart, like a newspaper boy yelling \"Extra! Extra!\" Christmas music was playing after mid-January, so the atmosphere felt strange. Next time I visit the city, I probably will pass.","Can't say that I was very impressed. Came for dinner in a hopeful and enthusiastic mood since the reviews have been pretty good, but I don't think this place lives up to its current good, but declining rating.\n\nOrdered the Combo fried rice (shrimp, chicken, beef, pork), sesame chicken, and garlic fried chicken. \n\nThe combo fried rice was pretty good, but ended up drinking about 6 glasses of water due to the MSG and sodium content. You'd think that the cook spent his better years in the French Foreign Legion in the Sahara eating salt tablets and developed a taste for them. \n\nThe sesame chicken had a good flavor and a thick brown sweet sauce. I liked it a lot until it got cool and the sauce looked (with that stringy consistency) more like glue. You think I'm kidding? I'm not.\n\nGarlic fried chicken was bad. Just bad. It was like an over roasted dried out half chicken with some dried garlic pieces sprinkled on top. No spices, no flavor, no good. \n\nWe then got all kinds of lip from the waitress when we asked if they could change the channel on the TV from college football, to the Suns game. They made it into this big deal that the \"customers\" wanted to see the football game. Yeah right, it was University of West Virginia Vs. University of Connecticut! I would have believed it if it was a local team....\n\nIt's better than a 1 star joint, but only because it's borderline edible. To be avoided.","This restaurant is located in the Chinese Cultural Center and was the one restaurant that I had not been to. So after some shopping at one of the shops, we stepped in to have dinner.\n\nWe stepped in and asked for a seat for two. We were seated immediately. The place was decorated nicely and a lady playing the piano made for great ambiance.\n\nWe looked at the menu briefly and ordered our drinks, an appetizer, a soup and two main dishes. The drinks came out promptly and so did the rest of the meal. My goodness everything we ordered was very tasty.\n\nThe waiter service itself however was not even close to the decor and food. He never introduced himself, and although he took our order, our food itself was brought out by a kitchen person.\n\nAfter we ordered our waiter really never came back asking if we needed anything else, except to give us our check at the end and that was after the person I was dining with got up and asked a different waiter for it.\n\nIt's amazing how a place with great food, decor, and ambiance can mess it all up by crappy waiter service.","I love Dim Sum, my favorite Chinese dish.\n\nWhen Golden Buddha first open, they have excellent Dim sum. I went there many times, I tell my friend how good it is, But now,  they change cook, taste more like  week old left over. Rumor has it, they change cook every few month, so Quality of cooking change. (not sure if that is true, but that is what I was told.)\nMy advice is; when you walk in the door and the place is pack, = Good Cook. if the place is bare = bad cook. leave immediately. don't waste your money.","If you just \"want\" dim sum, go here. If you are \"craving\" dim sum, go elsewhere (take a 5 hour drive west to neighboring state, California).\n\nAnyway, I've been visiting Golden Buddha in the noontime for roughly 2 years now. I believe they moved from their original site (7th St. & Osborn), formerly \"China Doll.\" Relocation brought along better atmosphere and smiling faces. This does not mean, better dim sum. But since we are in Phoenix, I will settle for what they have to offer. \n\nBe mindful of the dim sum tab. It's itemized high-medium-low. \n\nShaomai can be found as combinations of pork/mushroom, shrimp, or shark fin (which should not be confused as true shark bits, as the shaomai is prepared to look like a shark's fin). These picks are okay...perhaps on a better day shao mai will be served in less-rigid, or fresher wrappers. Potstickers are okay as well, just the usual scallion and pork, and dry wrapper. The baby pork ribs in light black bean sauce and jalapenos is alright, but sometimes lacks in taste. Tripe is also served in its bare minimum...so if you enjoy the texture and flavor of tripe, try this with its clear sauce and thinly sliced carrots and celery.  \nBuche (that's what I call it), or fried sesame balls are also available, although if you wait until dessert, they will also be a bit stiff. There are a few other things that may be \"spotted\" but are not worth mentioning. \n\nDon't order from their lunch menu, as you can find these over-salted dishes at Panda Express anyway. \n\nOverall, dim sum at Golden Buddha is a place to go if you are around the vicinity and feel like having something apart from the usual fast food. However, discriminating palates- beware.","Not impressed with this place at all. This was not the friendliest place around, maybe because of the language barrier (most or all were clearly native Chinese speakers), or maybe just the attitude of the employees.\n\nI ordered the sweet and sour chicken lunch, which came with the typical egg drop soup, crab rangoon, and egg roll. The soup was ok - maybe it's just me, but I prefer a real spoon to the scoop that they gave me. The egg roll was tiny and not that great, and the crab rangoon was ok, but maybe a little undercooked. The chicken wasn't bad, but nothing special, as was the rice and other stuff on the plate.\n\nOverall, this was just not my kind of Chinese place.","Disappointing.  Mediocre at best.  I am staying at the Aloft hotel in phoenix and ordered some delivery. I ordered a couple american chinese food staples: general tso's chicken, dumplings and hot&sour soup.  Soup had zero flavor, dumplings tasted freezer burned and processed.  General tso chicken was ehh. \n\nA lot of good reviews on here so it must be for eat in and for their dim sum.  Don't order delivery, you will be left hungry and unsatisfied.","Went there on Saturday for early lunch.  My wife did the dim sum, it was okay, we were both disgusted by the sugar cane shrimp; but the rest was good.  \n\nI ordered the chicken szechwuan, the waitress warned me it was \"spicy\" the reason I ordered it.  It came out delicious, but not what I would call spicy.  Overall its hard to find good Chinese in the valley and I would call this good without hesitation.","So I was referred to this place from the front desk of my hotel. I'm from SF so I'm coming from a place with really good chinese food. \n\nThe dim sum is just \"ok\" nothing for me to write home about. The one dish that I really liked was the chinese broccoli cooked with garlic sauce. Yum yum yum.  It's in a big bowl, not oily, not saucy, just really good. I think it's $7.50.  \n\nIt's a somewhat pricey and just like all chinese restaurants, it's not the cleanest.  The chair was filthy.  the dishes weren't all that great.  I wouldn't go back unless I want the chinese broccoli.  \n\nSo I went on a Sunday and it was not crowded at all. There's not a huge asian population  in Phoenix (not that I could tell) so I don't think there's a high demand for dim sum.  And also, I sooooooo felt like taking a pic of this, but a Mexican lady was pushing one of the dim sum carts. That is unheard of in SF.  This is a mainly mandarin restaurant and the dim sum places I go are usually cantonese.  Not a big deal though since the dishes look the same. \n\nDude, there was a turtle in the fish tank that I saw as I left.  I hope they don't eat that!","A Premier Chinese Atmosphere,\nThe Chinese cultural center and Asian Garden produces an Asain atmosphere that can be recognized from the 202.  \n With Dim Sum served this location earns its respect from the local community.\n\nDim Sum tip,  You have to be smart with the Dim Sum ladies they look nice innocent but they are professional sales people that will sell you more dishes than you need before you know what to do.  \n\nI love the desserts here ask the server to see the dessert tray.","This restaurant has a bit of an identity crisis. It is in the Chinese cultural center, but serves Japanese beer (Kirin on tap!) and the live piano music is American pop. We had to ask for chopsticks.\n\nHaving said that, the service was professional. Our waiter held a hot appetizer for one of our party who was away from the table so that it would not be cold when he returned. We were asked frequently--and not too frequently--if things were ok both by our waiter and the manager/proprietor.\n\nThe food was ok-to-good. Fried shrimp egg rolls were dainty but yummy. Duck was tasty but very chewy. Kung-pao chicken was pleasantly spiced. Plenty of rice. A pitcher of ice water with lemon was left at the table. \n\nAtmosphere was also pleasant. Chairs comfortable, tables spaced well, restrooms large and clean...and there is indeed a large golden Buddha by the entrance.","I took a group of friends here and relatives other times. The place is consistently good for Dim-sum during lunch. It is typical Chinese and nothing fancy.\n\nWhat helps this place is the moat scenery.  3 stars for visiting here based on convenience since there are similar places in town.","Having grown up in Hong Kong and having eaten dim sum in London, NY, LA, SF and Vancouver (actually Richmond), I can confidently say I know my dim sum.\n\nGood selection of well-executed dim sum when the carts actually come around and there's anything left in it.  I'd give it 4 stars for food but the wait definitely detracted from the whole experience.\n\nI think the problem with Golden Buddha is that they can't handle the heavy flow on weekends.  There's not enough regular dim sum eaters like LA that can sustain a steady flow of diners throughout the week, forcing restaurants like Golden Buddha to depend heavily on extra part-time help on weekends.  \n\nDim sum takes serious skill so the chef still ends up doing most of the work.  When we looked into the kitchen, we saw a Chinese woman doing most of the cooking herself.  No wonder it took forever for a cart to come out and when it does, it's swarmed on by a pack of vultures.\n\nIf you're willing to eat at a more simply decorated place with a smaller menu, I'd highly recommend China Chan.  It's much more relaxed - usually no wait on weekends.  An experienced chef makes all the dim sum himself so the menu's much shorter but all the classics are on it.  Anything steamed is made to order so is very fresh.","Situated in the Chinese Cultural Center near the SkyHarbor Airport, this was another pleasant find. All I had was the Dim Sum menu, and I would say this is the best you're gonna get in Phoenix. Still worth the stop to get your Dim Sum fix. The cart ladies were pleasant and very happy to converse with me in Cantonese. Only downside was the chicken sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaves, naw mei gai, was way overcooked, and mushy.","Do you want to eat Chinese Food in an elegant environment on a Friday night in Phoenix? \n\nBe entertained by classic, quiet standards being played live on a piano while you dine?\n\nAre you 50 years old and Caucasian?\n\nThen the Golden Buddha is the place for you! \n\nIts in the Chinese Cultural Center Mall on 44th, and a popular weekend spot for Dim Sum. For a DIm Sum starved Valley of the Sun, Golden Buddha's is decent. \n\nFor dinner, though, it is awfully Americanized and not very authentic Chinese. But with a bunch of American customers coming for dinner, what do you expect? They probably think they are getting \"real Chinese\" food by going to the Chinese Mall, but then again, they are used to PF Chang's or Stix normally in their neighborhood, so this is a step up.\n\nThe best thing about this place is the decor, which is clean and nice, with a Hong Kong Junk boat design covering the ceiling from the bar into the dining room. The next best thing is the Piano interludes on weekend nights. The service is next, which is a little overly eager to remove your plate, and the last thing is the food. \n\nThey do give decent portions. I ordered Guo Teh (potstickers) and got 6 fat ones. But they weren't served with the usual soy, chili oil and vinegar, but a soy and green onions mixture. The Mapo Tofu was ok, as they used a nice silky tofu, which was nice, but no green onions, and sliced black mushrooms instead, which I like, but not in this dish.\n\nCome here for the ambiance and music in the evenings, or on the weekend days for Dim Sum.","Decent dim sum, especially to be found in the middle of the desert. Sadly, the best food I've had in Phoenix.","This place is a little difficult for me to review.  I was staying at the Hampton Inn across the street and this is the closest restaurant so off I went.\n\nI walked in and the owner or manager met me at the door and asked \"how many\"?\n\nI told him I wanted to order take out and handed me a menu and pointed to the waiting area which was covered in newspapers.  I chose to go to the bar, order a glass of wine, and peruse the menu.\n\nThe drinks are expensive but I didn't think the food was.  Less than $10 for my Mongolian Chicken which came with white sticky rice and a fortune cookie.  When ordering I asked if I could have fried rice instead of white rice but was told \"no\".  Most places allow this for a nominal fee.\n\nFine by me.  Give the white rice.  Food was prepared and their to-go boxes were a lot better than the standard white Chinese \"to go\" boxes.  They also included the plastic-ware, napkin, and soy sauce, which a lot of places forget.\n\nLooking around I found a whole lot of goodness along with a couple disappointments.  Most notably the newspaper strewn about and behind the bar, to the right were a lot of boxes stacked in an unsightly fashion.  I could have been a little more presentable in my opinion.\n\nI peeked into the dining room because I wanted to see if the piano music was piped in or live.  It was live which was very nice. Also, the dinning room looked very nice and cozy.\n\nAs I was leaving the same man who greeted me upon entering made sure to wish me a good evening.  My initial impression of the man was that he was surly and testy but that's just how he comes off.\n\nThe food was very good.  The Mongolian sauce was mixture of sweet with spice and the chicken and vegetables all tasted fresh.","My husband and I went there Saturday, the service was great!  Our friends were going to be late so they told us to start.  And start we did!\nThey were serving Dim Sum, something we had never tried, so glad we did, it was wonderful, hubby wouldn't do the chicken feet, but I think next time I will, it looked very good.\nOur friends showed up and ordered their food, and ate all of it, they said that usually they take food home, but it was so good they had to eat all of it!\nWe will be going back very soon!","Let's see, over 50... check \nold white man...........check \neats dinner ...............check \nlistens to the piano  check \n\nwow this must be the place for me, I mean after all it is in a Chinese mall, no make that a Chinese Cultural Center. How could I possibly have discerning taste with such trickery to get me here to eat. \nDude if you are going to rate a restaurant no need to degrade others with your arrogance. \nFool is my review of wanugee N. \n\nNow on the restaurant. The last time we were here the food was not good, the piano was too loud and the waitress had a real attitude. IT won't keep me from going back as I have had good meals and wait service too. \n\nBack to wanugee N. I do not expect any place in Phx. to have authentic Chinese food, by that I mean the street food one finds in China. \nBut I do expect what I fork in to my mouth is worth what I am going to fork over in cost. Even an old white guy like me can tell the difference between good and bad food. No matter what it is called.","Okay so Ive been glum the past few days as I have an impending birthday. Every year this time I get all down in the dumps.. not that I'm not happy with my life cause life is good. Its more like getting further away from my youth and closer to being well, old. All of my grandparents were crotchety, sourpuss drama queens.. is that my fate? Can I break the mold or am I to going to be a crotchety sourpuss?\n\nSo as I contemplate and figure out what I'm going to do with my birthday baggage I decide to squash it with food. All weekend Ive been eating out and having a good time. This is one of the few times outside of a vacation where I will live it completely and to the near of sheer gluttony. So why not dim sum? \n\nIve chowed much dim sum in my 36 years of earthen wear.. of course some good and some bad. I have never been to a place where every dish was great.. Golden Buddha is no exception to this.. they do the basics well enough and have enough funky cool Asian style to keep me interested in returning. The carts around 1130 flow well but around noon it' s full blown freeway action! In fact there might be some road kill in there based on some of the looks on that last steam cart.. \n\nMe and 3 others who were feeling my pain ordered 14, count them, 14 different dishes. One of my friends is from Georgia and had never had dim sum but he is so courageous and unflinching that he was just a blast. Just the shot in the arm to get me out of my funk. I remember the first time I had dim sum.. my eyes wide open, nostrils flared and excited to see what was under the next steamer lid. That was him today.. one exciting thing after the next.. he was even willing to try chicken feet but this is one of those dishes not done very well here. \n\nMy friend took me back to a time where I was younger and less experienced. He looked up to me to guide him through the noodles, bao and sui mai.. like a big brother.. I'm privileged that I could show him something new and exciting and he was so into it! So instead of feeling sorry for myself I felt experienced and useful.. that there is something I can give back to others.. that its not all about me and me aging but about what can be shared with others.\n\nThere is so much more to do, give and feel in this short time we are here.. and Ill do it to, one bite at a time.","The best to be found in land locked Arizona.  My favorite sticky rice is here.  They have dim sum every day, but not a huge selection, though you can order off the menu.  I think it is much bigger on the weekends.  I'm just happy I can get my fix 7 days a week.  Beautiful gardens to walk through, with fish ponds, and a 99 market next door!","I ate at Golden Buddha a few weeks ago.  We ate at the restaurant after a day at the zoo with our 4 year old and had a blast.  The piano bar played tunes for my daughter and the staff was more than accommodating.  The general tso chicken was better than anything I can get in Tucson.  The soup was chocked full of fresh, read FRESH, not canned, vegetables.  All in all, I was very satisfied with the meal and the service.  Plus the decor is very nice, clean and cheery. \n\nEat at Golden Buddha.","For those who gave this place low marks, forgive me. I really like this place. Now I haven't tried various dim sum places so I'm reserving the right to downgrade the place as needed. The variety of food is plentiful, and the carts just keep on coming. I love the steamed pork buns, and the shiu mai (not sure if I spelled that correctly). Yesterday, my favorite pick was the deep fried rolls of taro and shrimp. YUM! I have never ordered from their menu so I can only talk about their dim sum. My friends and I try to go eat dim sum almost every Sunday. It's a cheap way to try new foods, and if you don't like it, well.. you can get away with pushing it aside with minimal guilt. Give it a try! You might be surprised.","I like Golden Buddha, have taken many friends there for Dim Sum.  \nTry not to \"hit\" the dumpling cart to heavy; otherwise cannot finish it to the dessert cart (LOL).\nLove the jasmine tea and the staff willing to help you if you do not understand the what each item is.\nSingapore Rice Noodles a favorite, along with any of the shrimp dumplings; also the broccoli and green beans.\nOnly wish that the carts with eggplant stuffed with shrimp or green peppers with shrimp were not on \"heated\" carts; by the time it gets to you the food is cold.\nOnly concern is that went on 22MAY2010 at 1:30PM; there was a closed sign due to electricity???\nREVISED: 26MAY2010 - called this evening - looks like they are back open again.","I've been to the Golden Buddha on several occasions and it is my favorite, by far, for honest Chinese food. \nWhile I've sampled everything from their vegetarian to their beef, I love their mandarin chicken. More recently, I was delighted to relive the wonders of their Kung Pao Chicken and Beef with Broccoli. \nI absolutely love the egg drop soup and mini crab rangoons that come with the meal.","The very first time I went to Golden Buddha was with my BFF and it was our first dim sum experience. Little did I know this would forever change my life and eating experiences. Although I must admit that first time was a bit awkward.\n\nGB wisely takes reservations which was wonderful (even though it wasn't crazy busy). Our assorted dim sum plates were flavorful and fresh. And the carts seemed to be in constant rotation so we were never too far from a good selection.\n\nWhat really helps GB is its location. The Cofco Center is an experience in itself, where one can have herbs specially blended, select a fresh member of marine life to take home and cook or browse through a store with one of the largest selections of Buddhas and hand fans I've experienced outside of San Francisco.","I've been to Golden Buddha a few times and have not been disappointed. \n\nThey have a LARGE selection of Dim Sum and if you're not careful you can get carried away.\n\nTry and get there early and you'll get the best and most fresh selection.\nMake sure you walk around the garden when you're done.","Probably the most comprehensive Chinese menu in the Valley.  Pick from well over 100 dishes, but if you want the best order the Peking Duck.  Everything else is very good, but without a wow factor.  You'll see lots of Chinese people in this massive restaurant, which probably means they're doing a fine job in the kitchen.","I very much enjoyed eating here. Food was great. Fairly fast service. Wasn't expensive either for the 4 of us.","Golden Buddha has GREAT dim sum.  Their prices are reasonable and the staff is very polite wheeling their little carts.  I tend to go on the weekend because there is more selection but they do dim sum throughout the week.  They also have some very authentic dishes on the menu for those who are more of the adventurous types.  Be sure to say hello to the turtles the next time you go.","This place in the Chinese Cultural Center has a very pretty and elegant bar area. I was pleased to learn that they had some very reasonable and delicious happy hour snacks. This is a good place for a Pina Colada. I had one by myself along with some dumplings and fried shrimp appetizer. Sadly I never brought anyone else here with me. It was happy hour heaven but you know? A lot of my friends in AZ pretty much hang out in one neighborhood or another and nobody I know really lives close to the Buddha.\nThe airport is pretty close by. This might be a good pre-flight send-off location.","I have had dim sum in New Orleans and Phoenix (not SF), and this is about equal to the best of New Orleans as far as flavor.\nAs for ambiance, today was a good day. I've had dim sum here about a dozen times, and have had very good service and quality 90% of the time, including weekends. I have had bad days here, but since today was good, I'll rate accordingly. It's closer to a 4.5, but since I can't give half-stars, I rounded up.\nDon't expect me to give these the right names, but... I was less than impressed with the bbq pork balls. They tasted too much like honey and the beef was minimal. The bbq sauce tasted bottled. Outside of that, their herbal hot tea is delicious even on a hot day.\nThe shu mai were very good, and the shrimp in a spinach dumpling was fantastic. A definite don't miss is their sticky rice in lotus leaf. It's among the best I've had anywhere. Just be careful; you'll find bones in it every once in a while. Go for any of their steamed dumplings; they're very flavorful. As others have said, I love the Chinese broccoli, but you'll only find it on the carts on weekends. Otherwise order it off the menu.\nToday (11:30 lunch) the carts came around often, and everything except the pork buns was piping hot and fresh. By the way, despite the price increases, even the sticky rice was considered a medium size entree, and the two of us eating there escaped with a bill under $20 and we were done in under 30 minutes.\nI strongly recommend the dim sum here, whether you've had it a million times or have never had it before. You usually won't be disappointed.","I don't really understand the poor reviews on this place.....maybe it depends on the day you go? We went on a Sunday, it was crazy busy, but service was great! (of course, my view of customer service is a little different then the rest... I used to live on an island where you were just happy to find what you were looking for, let alone expect good customer service) Anyways, our server was very sweet! Always had a smile on her face. The carts served us promplty and none of the food was cold. They always had whatever we wanted (I hate having to wait for the next cart).\n\nNow, as for the actual dim sum and food.......holy cow, to die for! So flavorful and fresh!! The broccoli makes you sing...and the wine noodles, make you cry. You leave with very weird mixed emotions, but mostly a happy belly full of yummy food.\n\nIn my opinion, this is the best dim sum I have been able to find in Phx. I'm ditching my previous spot (Mekong Palace) and will be back to Golden Buddha when the dim sum monster strikes again!"],"type":["Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low

Un-fresh and damn near flavorless all but for some powdery heat. Please invest in fresh chillies; they keep well and will make that \"8\" really pop with flavor.","I have been to this place this weekend with my fried family. We expected some authentic Indian style food. We ordered chicken biriyani, lamb biriyani, peas pulav and Chicken Pakora, Gulab jam. Biriyani was awful it's taste less. Full of racines. This restaurants is definitely not for South Indians. Maintainance and service was good but food is completely tasteless. Chicken pakora is at best. Papad is awesome. On Biriyani and pees pulav we Wasted money.","This place is terrible. Pittsburgh does not know how to make any food correct, let alone the complexity of Indian cuisine.  This city is the dumpster of the eastern U.S.  Do not go here, do not ever go to Pittsburgh.","I had high hopes for Taste of India, after reading the reviews, but I was not impressed. The food did not taste fresh (I had pakoras and an eggplant dish) and the rice was definitely old and crisp from sitting in the bottom of the cooker. I asked for spicy and my dish was quite mild. We were there toward the end of the night and the staff seemed resentful of our presence. As much as I love Indian food, I'll probably give Taste of India one more chance sometime, earlier in the evening. I hope to report back with at least one additional star.","The problem is inconsistency.  Sometimes a dish is very good, other times not so good.  Dal Makhni last night was like soup--all liquid, little dal. Lamb Curry lacked flavor when in the past it has been wonderful.  It appears that there are different cooks whose approach to dishes can be radically different.  I'd like to be able to count on a consistent product.","If you really know and like Indian cuisine then food here gonna be flavorless and bland for you. Tandoori chicken doesn't taste like one etc. Decor is tasteless and old. Carpet looks really dirty. I'm definitely not coming back.","Good, solid, and strangely inexpensive. \n\nWhile I didn't find Taste of India to be amazingly awesome, its currently in the running for my favorite Indian option in Pittsburgh. Service was fairly attentive, the naan was hot & crispy, and the chicken tikka was really tasty. \nA surprise: the veggie samosas have just a bit of spice-- unexpected and fun! Parking can be a challenge due to the location (directly across the street from Children's Hospital), but there are lots of meters around (and parking is free after 6pm).","Cozy and dim lighting. Food is okay - large quantities for take-out, watch out!","Friendly, kind staff and good service.  I'll go here again and again, for eat-in or take-out.  I don't really have any favorites here...everything is tasty!","Had a great experience here.  Service was super friendly and prompt.  The chicken tikka masala is excellent as well as the paneer naan.  I also tried the chicken curry, which used dark meat.  I thought it was just OK because of the poor quality of the chicken.  However, the curry was excellent.  I can't wait to go back!","The food is good, and excellently spiced.  Though others on this site have reported not being able to get dishes spicy enough, I've never had that problem (when I've ordered 10 out of 10, I got 10).  In fact, that's one of my favorite things about this restaurant: they cook the food exactly the way I want it, pretty consistently.  Sauces are creamy; meat is tender; and prices are reasonable.  I'd say this is easily one of the better Indian restaurants in the city, which is saying something given the plethora of good options.","I got with the tandoori dinner. 18$ for a full meal from appetizer to a nice small desert. Level 7 of spice, it was spicy but if you enjoy extra spicy kick it to a 10. The tandoori dinner was perfect size including the lamb saag I got as my 2nd meat pick. I also got king fisher Indian beer. A Good lager. It was a cold Monday night so I ended up eating my meal and chatting with the guy working the front of the house. It was rather nice since I went alone.\n\nIn the end good service and a relaxing meal with a nice hot cup of tea at the end.\n\nIt was all very good but I have had better lamb saag in the past.","I've drive by, seen the neon sign and the dark windows and have been very skeptical. But I finally went inside and it was delicious! Clean, yummy, and the BYOB!","I love this place! Its the best Indian food I've had in Pittsburgh! I absolutely love the chicken tikka masala, it is sooo good!! My boyfriend and I ordered take out once and I like spicy rating of 1 and he likes a 7 and when we got home and tried it they were both sevens. So if you're really sensitive like me, make sure to double check your order. I would definitely recommend Taste of India! I also really like all the vegetarian options!","Tried the vegetarian thali ($12ish) and was really impressed by the quality, variety, and spiciness to order.  Will head back here with a smile.","I have been really struggling to find a good indian place in Pittsburgh, since I moved back into town.  I ordered takeout from Taste of India, and it was ready very quickly (~15 minutes).  I ordered the Saag paneer, chicken tikka masala and an order of plain and garlic naan.  The naan was amazing!  My girlfriend who doesn't even really like Indian food loved the Chicken tikka masala, which was also really good.  The chicken was of really good quality and the sauce was delicious.  I also enjoyed the saag paneer, but probably not the best i've ever had.  Either way, the food was delicious and I will definitely go back!","Just moved from Pittsburgh and I miss Taste of India - this place is great.","Let me explain to you something. I didn't know, until I moved 12 hours away from here, what a magical place Taste of India really is. I also didn't know, that when I fly into Pittsburgh, I would directly be driving from the airport to pick up take out before seeing my family. Helllooo! Here is your daughter you haven't seen in over a year, she comes reeking of curries and spices every-single-time! \n\nCan we start with the fact that the service here is spectacular?! My friends and I have been coming here for years. The owners are cute and funny and we are terrors when we are there because we bring large parties and we are so excited to order an entire table of plates.\n\nWhat fills our table? \n\nBooze, yes, they have beer.\n\nBread: Chapatti (Yummy Whole Wheat Goodness!)\n\nVeggie Options:\nPaneer Jalferji (Cheese and Veg)\nDal Sag (Lentils)\nPaneer Makhni (Cheese and Peas)\nChana Masala (Duh)\n*Personal Fav: Malia Kofta (These little fried vegetable balls with creamy tomato sauce and almonds!) --Haven't found this one anywhere else as good as theirs! Ah! I am drooling thinking of it. \n\nWhat do they do to this freaking food? I just don't know. Go soon! Ask for spice level of 7-8 if you want to tantalize your taste-buds with some fiery food and if you would like to ship me a container of the Malia Kofta I will be more than happy to message you my address.....\n\n\nOh, and my favorite date in Pittsburgh? Taste of India and dancing at Brillo Box. So iconic. So Pittsburgh.","I have been to Taste of India several times, and every time they have never disappointed me. The service is great and the food is amazing. We were seated promptly, orders were taken, water replenished as soon as I was close to being empty and food came out right away. The food are delicious, proportioned and well priced. I always have the chicken tikka masala and butter chicken. I also had their garlic naan, beef and lamb curry. So if you're in the mood for some good Indian cuisine, Taste of India is a great choice.","There are two Indian restaurants pretty close to each other: Taste of India and People's. People's has better appetizers, and of course they have 1/2 off during certain hours, but Taste of India is better by far at entrees, and their masala tea is delicious. The nan is always hot, like hot hot, steaming hot, burn your hands hot, and perfectly done. \n\nChicken Tikka Masala leftovers are sitting in the fridge right now, calling my name. Everything is good and the portions are beyond generous. What is particularly striking is the pricing. Indian food in Orlando and DC tends to be expensive, and those are my frames of reference, but Taste of India is completely reasonable. Even bizarrely inexpensive considering the quality of the food you get.\n\nThe store front is odd, and the place never looks open, but don't be discouraged from going. Once you walk in you'll be seated quickly and served an onion and a mint chutney. Generally there is a young kid in the far back table playing on a computer or GameBoy.\n\nAt the end of the meal, your tip tray comes covered in an anise and sugar mixture with little pink, yellow, and white pellet things. I'm an addict, but always end up eating one pinch more than I ought, where the flavor becomes unappealing. And as much as I know this, I cannot help myself.","I asked the waitress what she recommended. She said they were all good and it's hard to make a decision. I was going to be the judge of that, and she was indeed telling the truth. So good!","Jordan & I have been eating Taste of India at CMU for a while, without knowing it was Taste of India.  At CMU they offer super inexpensive lunches that are more filling than anywhere else to eat at lunch. During this winter break, we have been going through some serious withdraw while the cafe is closed.\n\nThank you YELPERS once again, in our search to satiate our curry addiction, we have found our distributor!  We were excited to read that this restaurant supplied our weekly lunches and we ordered!!\n\nI ordered the Alu Matar Mushroom at a spicy rating of 3 (yes, I'm a sissy), but it was EXACTLY what I wanted!!  Jordan ordered Alu Gobhi which was cauliflower & potato at a spicy rating of 5.  We truly weren't sure how to scale our tolerance; but we decided that next time we could both go hotter.\n\nWe also can't wait to try the Lunch Buffet! We really wish we would have known that this existed during the week in between Christmas & New Years when we were fiending for Indian food.  Now that we know, I have no doubt we will soon become regulars.\n\nWe have also tried Tamarind in Oakland, but that place just made my mouth go numb after it was all said and done (and left me with an unpleasant digestion experience).  All of the bad cliche things you hear about Indian food, is nothing like Taste of India.  You can taste the love cooked in.","Buffet, while small is totally worth it. Has all the essentials!","Darren brought me here, and as a Indian food n00b, I was impressed with everything included in the economical Dinner for Two which gets a diner nan, a meat dish, a veggie dish, dal, a dessert, and tea. The tea and kheer was a nice way to cap off the meal. The mango beef and alu palak were superb. I could live on the bread alone. They look to have renovated the place, and Darren said the bathrooms were much nicer this time around.","Delicious food! The decor is a little lacking, but the food was so outstanding that I have to give it 5 stars. We had 3 types of bread, along with goat mango curry, chana masala, and chicken tikka masala. All of these were excellent, with fresh flavor and nuanced taste. We asked for a spice level of 8, and the spice was spot on.  Flavors were so without being muddled. \n\nI would definitely, definitely return next time I come to Pittsburgh.","This place knocked me out.\n\nI had garlic naan and the lamb Shahajahani.  The sauce was so good, I used all the naan to sop it up.  (The waiter told me it was OK to do that.  Not sure if it really was, but I don't care.  I wasn't gonna leave any.)\n\nI travel a lot, and enjoy finding little places like this that are inconspicuous, where you can get great food, great service at a really decent price.  I had what I described above, plus a half-carafe of their house wine (not spectacular, but who cares) for $29, tip included.  And it was a good tip.\n\nThe server was very friendly and helpful and took time to help select the best choice for what I was in the mood for. And, he thanked me about six times for coming in, which was really refreshing.\n\nThis beats Indian I've had in Boston, New York and Berlin.  Will definitely be back on next trip to Pittsburgh.","That woman that you see in the corner, a table full of food? Yeah - that's me. Don't judge....  I lose all ability to think rationally when I cross through the door. 4 entrees, biryani and a samosa? Yes. Why not? How can I possibly be expected to choose between such flavorful and reasonably priced food? It's the culinary equivalent of Sophie's Choice.\n\nThe staff is wonderful, the food is terrific - get the Samosas, saag paneer and dal makhni. Oh, and the tikka masala. And the muglai korma.\nOr you could do the lunch buffet and save your dignity. But then you wouldn't have leftovers for lunch. And - trust me - you'll want leftovers for lunch."],"type":["Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Medium Rating","Medium Rating","High Rating","High

waiter was to be found about ten minutes later they gave us our water and left again! It wasn't even busy! There were only TWO dim sum carts floating around somewhere. Then our waiter finally came around and took our orders of lunch entrees. The food was not even that good as the reviews that are posted on here. When we came up to pay, the bill was super overpriced. I will not be returning here, I am better off eating at Great Wall Cuisine.","If this place had zero stars I would have given them that ! Let me start off by saying I was so excited to read all great reviews so maybe I just came in on a off day? We walked in and were seated came over and asked if we wanted water or tea I guess they don't serve anything Else, Then we placed an order pork dumplings and sticky rice nasty! Then I asked if they served egg rolls they said they were out!!! they pushed their little carts around with hot plates that basically steam the food and is not fresh and what you get is soggy poor customer service we had to get up and look for someone to give us our tab so we could get the heck out of there are get some real food. It looked like it would be a great place for groups of people would not recommend if you are on mission for what you want and want to place an order but it could be a fun experience for some people.","You walk into a Chinese restaurant on a Saturday afternoon for dim sum and you expect the place to be PACKED.  Well, walking in to a pretty much empty dining room, it's a VERY CLEAR SIGN.  But my friend insisted and I was very hesitant for good reasons.  Another indicator, the majority of the patrons were NON Asian.  \n\nFood: You walk in and you see carts of the food by the entrance to the dining room.  Umm, I thought dim sum should come right off the steamer and into the carts and they roll it around, not sitting around.  The dim sum was garbage.  It had the typical selection, but at minimum.  \n\nService: It's ok.  But it doesn't make up for the horrible food.\n\nBottom line: NO WAY!  Stay away!","I've been here many times...Mother's Day with family, dim sum with book club, etc. But I will not go back again.  I stopped in to ask the owner about a donation or reduced price for a class of under-privileged kids that I volunteer with.  His reaction was to scoff and shoo me out the door while handing me his card and saying I could email him.  He turned his back and headed off to the messy newspaper-strewn table he haunts between guests arrivals.  Maybe he's a community-minded business owner, but then again, maybe he's not.  I'll be dining elsewhere.","Being from Chicago, we are used to getting authentic Chinese food all the time.  But when we first starting spending a lot of time in Scottsdale/Phoenix, we found it a challenge to get authentic Chinese food.  We were excited to find the Golden Buddha and have made many trips over the years all the way from the Troon North area to get our fix.  However, service has declined to the point where it is no longer worth the aggravation.  We went there last night for Chinese New Year and will never go back.  Granted they were very busy because of a lot of large tables there, but waiting almost an hour to get our food is not acceptable under any circumstance!  45 mins. into our wait, the waitress came back (after we flagged her down to ask about our food) and said one of the dishes we ordered was not available....after 45 mins.!!!! What makes the whole experience an unforgivable one is that the manager/owner is so indifferent and never apologized or offered a discount off the bill...nothing.  When we left, the same manager was at the piano singing in Chinese. Huh?  Other than Nee House in Scottsdale, the search goes on for a restaurant that serves authentic Chinese food closer to home.","I will NEVER go there again.  I reserved a table for a group of 16 people for 5:00 PM on Christmas Eve .  The person on the phone ( I believe the manager) repeatedly asked me to call ahead and give him an accurate head count since he said they'd be swamped that day.  I followed up with him twice.  \nWhen the first couple of us arrived, we had menus shoved in our faces immediately and told we \"Must order now.  Must order now\" because they were going to be busy later on.  The place was practically empty.  As each person arrived, they were treated the same way. \nWe rushed and placed our orders and then they brought out our checks WAY before we saw any sign of our food.  I have never in my life been treated so rudely by a restaurant.\nIt was utter chaos when the food started coming out while everyone struggled to get the correct dish they ordered.  One person didn't get her food until we were all just about finished eating. \nOne top of all that, the food wasn't even good.  I've had better Kung Pao Chicken at Panda Express!\nAfter being rushed through our meal, the place wasn't even half full by the time we left.  I thought being at the Cultural Center, this restaurant would be a sure thing but boy was I wrong.  Lovely way to spend Christmas Eve..","If you are looking a chinese restaurant to host a big party look some other than the Golden Buddah.  I recently attended a banquet at the Golden Buddah and I was shocked at the level of quality of food and service.  Of the 10 dishes served 4 were nearly inedible.  \n\nThere was a crab claw appetizer, most chinese restaurants prepare this dish by taking a crab claw surrounding it with ground shrimp, batter and then deep fry.  At Golden Buddah, the crab claw served was mostly batter.  \n\nThe shark fin soup served was mostly broth.  Shark fin is an expensive ingredient and most places usually use imitation shark fin, but come on at least put something in there so that I know I'm eating soup and not dirty sink water.  \n\nGinger scallion lobster is battered, fried, and then stir fried in a sauce with ginger and scallions.  The ginger scallion lobster served was over-cooked and dried out.  \n\nLastly, there was a steamed fish.  The fish was raw in the middle.   \n\nIt wasn't all bad, there was a crispy chicken with garlic dish that was pretty good, but out of 10 dishes 4 were bad, 5 were okay, and 1 was good.  \n\nDoes 4 bad dishes out of 10 warrant a one star rating?  Well it does when you factor in the service.  The soup, appetizer, and first entree arrived timely, but after that there was a 1 hour gap before we received the next dish.  The dishes were not served with accompanying white rice which I thought was odd.  We had to ask for it, and even the rice took a while to arrive.","I agree with Crystal C., that the dim sum isn't the greatest I've ever had. In fact, I am not sure if the meal was so tasty that it was memorable. I do remember the \"calamari\" was not really calamari, like you would think. It was presented more like a sweet and sour pork (so calamari with LOTS of breading) without any sauce. As a result, the dish was dry and salty.\n\nThe sticky rice was good (hard to mess up), the chicken feet were okay (needed more five spice powder), and the shumai was alright. The noodles were good, and I can see why the cart ran out after the first round. The diners were an equal mix of Asians and Americans. I would've preferred to see more Asians eating (as I am used to in a Chinatown and gives an indication of authenticity), but I do realize we're in Phoenix where the Asian population is not like San Francisco or Houston. \n\nThe meal came to about $30 for two, including jasmine tea. The carts are loud because they are made out of metal and roll on tile. I am also not used to staff members shouting what they have in their cart, like a newspaper boy yelling \"Extra! Extra!\" Christmas music was playing after mid-January, so the atmosphere felt strange. Next time I visit the city, I probably will pass.","Can't say that I was very impressed. Came for dinner in a hopeful and enthusiastic mood since the reviews have been pretty good, but I don't think this place lives up to its current good, but declining rating.\n\nOrdered the Combo fried rice (shrimp, chicken, beef, pork), sesame chicken, and garlic fried chicken. \n\nThe combo fried rice was pretty good, but ended up drinking about 6 glasses of water due to the MSG and sodium content. You'd think that the cook spent his better years in the French Foreign Legion in the Sahara eating salt tablets and developed a taste for them. \n\nThe sesame chicken had a good flavor and a thick brown sweet sauce. I liked it a lot until it got cool and the sauce looked (with that stringy consistency) more like glue. You think I'm kidding? I'm not.\n\nGarlic fried chicken was bad. Just bad. It was like an over roasted dried out half chicken with some dried garlic pieces sprinkled on top. No spices, no flavor, no good. \n\nWe then got all kinds of lip from the waitress when we asked if they could change the channel on the TV from college football, to the Suns game. They made it into this big deal that the \"customers\" wanted to see the football game. Yeah right, it was University of West Virginia Vs. University of Connecticut! I would have believed it if it was a local team....\n\nIt's better than a 1 star joint, but only because it's borderline edible. To be avoided.","This restaurant is located in the Chinese Cultural Center and was the one restaurant that I had not been to. So after some shopping at one of the shops, we stepped in to have dinner.\n\nWe stepped in and asked for a seat for two. We were seated immediately. The place was decorated nicely and a lady playing the piano made for great ambiance.\n\nWe looked at the menu briefly and ordered our drinks, an appetizer, a soup and two main dishes. The drinks came out promptly and so did the rest of the meal. My goodness everything we ordered was very tasty.\n\nThe waiter service itself however was not even close to the decor and food. He never introduced himself, and although he took our order, our food itself was brought out by a kitchen person.\n\nAfter we ordered our waiter really never came back asking if we needed anything else, except to give us our check at the end and that was after the person I was dining with got up and asked a different waiter for it.\n\nIt's amazing how a place with great food, decor, and ambiance can mess it all up by crappy waiter service.","I love Dim Sum, my favorite Chinese dish.\n\nWhen Golden Buddha first open, they have excellent Dim sum. I went there many times, I tell my friend how good it is, But now,  they change cook, taste more like  week old left over. Rumor has it, they change cook every few month, so Quality of cooking change. (not sure if that is true, but that is what I was told.)\nMy advice is; when you walk in the door and the place is pack, = Good Cook. if the place is bare = bad cook. leave immediately. don't waste your money.","If you just \"want\" dim sum, go here. If you are \"craving\" dim sum, go elsewhere (take a 5 hour drive west to neighboring state, California).\n\nAnyway, I've been visiting Golden Buddha in the noontime for roughly 2 years now. I believe they moved from their original site (7th St. & Osborn), formerly \"China Doll.\" Relocation brought along better atmosphere and smiling faces. This does not mean, better dim sum. But since we are in Phoenix, I will settle for what they have to offer. \n\nBe mindful of the dim sum tab. It's itemized high-medium-low. \n\nShaomai can be found as combinations of pork/mushroom, shrimp, or shark fin (which should not be confused as true shark bits, as the shaomai is prepared to look like a shark's fin). These picks are okay...perhaps on a better day shao mai will be served in less-rigid, or fresher wrappers. Potstickers are okay as well, just the usual scallion and pork, and dry wrapper. The baby pork ribs in light black bean sauce and jalapenos is alright, but sometimes lacks in taste. Tripe is also served in its bare minimum...so if you enjoy the texture and flavor of tripe, try this with its clear sauce and thinly sliced carrots and celery.  \nBuche (that's what I call it), or fried sesame balls are also available, although if you wait until dessert, they will also be a bit stiff. There are a few other things that may be \"spotted\" but are not worth mentioning. \n\nDon't order from their lunch menu, as you can find these over-salted dishes at Panda Express anyway. \n\nOverall, dim sum at Golden Buddha is a place to go if you are around the vicinity and feel like having something apart from the usual fast food. However, discriminating palates- beware.","Not impressed with this place at all. This was not the friendliest place around, maybe because of the language barrier (most or all were clearly native Chinese speakers), or maybe just the attitude of the employees.\n\nI ordered the sweet and sour chicken lunch, which came with the typical egg drop soup, crab rangoon, and egg roll. The soup was ok - maybe it's just me, but I prefer a real spoon to the scoop that they gave me. The egg roll was tiny and not that great, and the crab rangoon was ok, but maybe a little undercooked. The chicken wasn't bad, but nothing special, as was the rice and other stuff on the plate.\n\nOverall, this was just not my kind of Chinese place.","Disappointing.  Mediocre at best.  I am staying at the Aloft hotel in phoenix and ordered some delivery. I ordered a couple american chinese food staples: general tso's chicken, dumplings and hot&sour soup.  Soup had zero flavor, dumplings tasted freezer burned and processed.  General tso chicken was ehh. \n\nA lot of good reviews on here so it must be for eat in and for their dim sum.  Don't order delivery, you will be left hungry and unsatisfied.","Went there on Saturday for early lunch.  My wife did the dim sum, it was okay, we were both disgusted by the sugar cane shrimp; but the rest was good.  \n\nI ordered the chicken szechwuan, the waitress warned me it was \"spicy\" the reason I ordered it.  It came out delicious, but not what I would call spicy.  Overall its hard to find good Chinese in the valley and I would call this good without hesitation.","So I was referred to this place from the front desk of my hotel. I'm from SF so I'm coming from a place with really good chinese food. \n\nThe dim sum is just \"ok\" nothing for me to write home about. The one dish that I really liked was the chinese broccoli cooked with garlic sauce. Yum yum yum.  It's in a big bowl, not oily, not saucy, just really good. I think it's $7.50.  \n\nIt's a somewhat pricey and just like all chinese restaurants, it's not the cleanest.  The chair was filthy.  the dishes weren't all that great.  I wouldn't go back unless I want the chinese broccoli.  \n\nSo I went on a Sunday and it was not crowded at all. There's not a huge asian population  in Phoenix (not that I could tell) so I don't think there's a high demand for dim sum.  And also, I sooooooo felt like taking a pic of this, but a Mexican lady was pushing one of the dim sum carts. That is unheard of in SF.  This is a mainly mandarin restaurant and the dim sum places I go are usually cantonese.  Not a big deal though since the dishes look the same. \n\nDude, there was a turtle in the fish tank that I saw as I left.  I hope they don't eat that!","A Premier Chinese Atmosphere,\nThe Chinese cultural center and Asian Garden produces an Asain atmosphere that can be recognized from the 202.  \n With Dim Sum served this location earns its respect from the local community.\n\nDim Sum tip,  You have to be smart with the Dim Sum ladies they look nice innocent but they are professional sales people that will sell you more dishes than you need before you know what to do.  \n\nI love the desserts here ask the server to see the dessert tray.","This restaurant has a bit of an identity crisis. It is in the Chinese cultural center, but serves Japanese beer (Kirin on tap!) and the live piano music is American pop. We had to ask for chopsticks.\n\nHaving said that, the service was professional. Our waiter held a hot appetizer for one of our party who was away from the table so that it would not be cold when he returned. We were asked frequently--and not too frequently--if things were ok both by our waiter and the manager/proprietor.\n\nThe food was ok-to-good. Fried shrimp egg rolls were dainty but yummy. Duck was tasty but very chewy. Kung-pao chicken was pleasantly spiced. Plenty of rice. A pitcher of ice water with lemon was left at the table. \n\nAtmosphere was also pleasant. Chairs comfortable, tables spaced well, restrooms large and clean...and there is indeed a large golden Buddha by the entrance.","I took a group of friends here and relatives other times. The place is consistently good for Dim-sum during lunch. It is typical Chinese and nothing fancy.\n\nWhat helps this place is the moat scenery.  3 stars for visiting here based on convenience since there are similar places in town.","Having grown up in Hong Kong and having eaten dim sum in London, NY, LA, SF and Vancouver (actually Richmond), I can confidently say I know my dim sum.\n\nGood selection of well-executed dim sum when the carts actually come around and there's anything left in it.  I'd give it 4 stars for food but the wait definitely detracted from the whole experience.\n\nI think the problem with Golden Buddha is that they can't handle the heavy flow on weekends.  There's not enough regular dim sum eaters like LA that can sustain a steady flow of diners throughout the week, forcing restaurants like Golden Buddha to depend heavily on extra part-time help on weekends.  \n\nDim sum takes serious skill so the chef still ends up doing most of the work.  When we looked into the kitchen, we saw a Chinese woman doing most of the cooking herself.  No wonder it took forever for a cart to come out and when it does, it's swarmed on by a pack of vultures.\n\nIf you're willing to eat at a more simply decorated place with a smaller menu, I'd highly recommend China Chan.  It's much more relaxed - usually no wait on weekends.  An experienced chef makes all the dim sum himself so the menu's much shorter but all the classics are on it.  Anything steamed is made to order so is very fresh.","Situated in the Chinese Cultural Center near the SkyHarbor Airport, this was another pleasant find. All I had was the Dim Sum menu, and I would say this is the best you're gonna get in Phoenix. Still worth the stop to get your Dim Sum fix. The cart ladies were pleasant and very happy to converse with me in Cantonese. Only downside was the chicken sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaves, naw mei gai, was way overcooked, and mushy.","Do you want to eat Chinese Food in an elegant environment on a Friday night in Phoenix? \n\nBe entertained by classic, quiet standards being played live on a piano while you dine?\n\nAre you 50 years old and Caucasian?\n\nThen the Golden Buddha is the place for you! \n\nIts in the Chinese Cultural Center Mall on 44th, and a popular weekend spot for Dim Sum. For a DIm Sum starved Valley of the Sun, Golden Buddha's is decent. \n\nFor dinner, though, it is awfully Americanized and not very authentic Chinese. But with a bunch of American customers coming for dinner, what do you expect? They probably think they are getting \"real Chinese\" food by going to the Chinese Mall, but then again, they are used to PF Chang's or Stix normally in their neighborhood, so this is a step up.\n\nThe best thing about this place is the decor, which is clean and nice, with a Hong Kong Junk boat design covering the ceiling from the bar into the dining room. The next best thing is the Piano interludes on weekend nights. The service is next, which is a little overly eager to remove your plate, and the last thing is the food. \n\nThey do give decent portions. I ordered Guo Teh (potstickers) and got 6 fat ones. But they weren't served with the usual soy, chili oil and vinegar, but a soy and green onions mixture. The Mapo Tofu was ok, as they used a nice silky tofu, which was nice, but no green onions, and sliced black mushrooms instead, which I like, but not in this dish.\n\nCome here for the ambiance and music in the evenings, or on the weekend days for Dim Sum.","Decent dim sum, especially to be found in the middle of the desert. Sadly, the best food I've had in Phoenix.","This place is a little difficult for me to review.  I was staying at the Hampton Inn across the street and this is the closest restaurant so off I went.\n\nI walked in and the owner or manager met me at the door and asked \"how many\"?\n\nI told him I wanted to order take out and handed me a menu and pointed to the waiting area which was covered in newspapers.  I chose to go to the bar, order a glass of wine, and peruse the menu.\n\nThe drinks are expensive but I didn't think the food was.  Less than $10 for my Mongolian Chicken which came with white sticky rice and a fortune cookie.  When ordering I asked if I could have fried rice instead of white rice but was told \"no\".  Most places allow this for a nominal fee.\n\nFine by me.  Give the white rice.  Food was prepared and their to-go boxes were a lot better than the standard white Chinese \"to go\" boxes.  They also included the plastic-ware, napkin, and soy sauce, which a lot of places forget.\n\nLooking around I found a whole lot of goodness along with a couple disappointments.  Most notably the newspaper strewn about and behind the bar, to the right were a lot of boxes stacked in an unsightly fashion.  I could have been a little more presentable in my opinion.\n\nI peeked into the dining room because I wanted to see if the piano music was piped in or live.  It was live which was very nice. Also, the dinning room looked very nice and cozy.\n\nAs I was leaving the same man who greeted me upon entering made sure to wish me a good evening.  My initial impression of the man was that he was surly and testy but that's just how he comes off.\n\nThe food was very good.  The Mongolian sauce was mixture of sweet with spice and the chicken and vegetables all tasted fresh.","My husband and I went there Saturday, the service was great!  Our friends were going to be late so they told us to start.  And start we did!\nThey were serving Dim Sum, something we had never tried, so glad we did, it was wonderful, hubby wouldn't do the chicken feet, but I think next time I will, it looked very good.\nOur friends showed up and ordered their food, and ate all of it, they said that usually they take food home, but it was so good they had to eat all of it!\nWe will be going back very soon!","Let's see, over 50... check \nold white man...........check \neats dinner ...............check \nlistens to the piano  check \n\nwow this must be the place for me, I mean after all it is in a Chinese mall, no make that a Chinese Cultural Center. How could I possibly have discerning taste with such trickery to get me here to eat. \nDude if you are going to rate a restaurant no need to degrade others with your arrogance. \nFool is my review of wanugee N. \n\nNow on the restaurant. The last time we were here the food was not good, the piano was too loud and the waitress had a real attitude. IT won't keep me from going back as I have had good meals and wait service too. \n\nBack to wanugee N. I do not expect any place in Phx. to have authentic Chinese food, by that I mean the street food one finds in China. \nBut I do expect what I fork in to my mouth is worth what I am going to fork over in cost. Even an old white guy like me can tell the difference between good and bad food. No matter what it is called.","Okay so Ive been glum the past few days as I have an impending birthday. Every year this time I get all down in the dumps.. not that I'm not happy with my life cause life is good. Its more like getting further away from my youth and closer to being well, old. All of my grandparents were crotchety, sourpuss drama queens.. is that my fate? Can I break the mold or am I to going to be a crotchety sourpuss?\n\nSo as I contemplate and figure out what I'm going to do with my birthday baggage I decide to squash it with food. All weekend Ive been eating out and having a good time. This is one of the few times outside of a vacation where I will live it completely and to the near of sheer gluttony. So why not dim sum? \n\nIve chowed much dim sum in my 36 years of earthen wear.. of course some good and some bad. I have never been to a place where every dish was great.. Golden Buddha is no exception to this.. they do the basics well enough and have enough funky cool Asian style to keep me interested in returning. The carts around 1130 flow well but around noon it' s full blown freeway action! In fact there might be some road kill in there based on some of the looks on that last steam cart.. \n\nMe and 3 others who were feeling my pain ordered 14, count them, 14 different dishes. One of my friends is from Georgia and had never had dim sum but he is so courageous and unflinching that he was just a blast. Just the shot in the arm to get me out of my funk. I remember the first time I had dim sum.. my eyes wide open, nostrils flared and excited to see what was under the next steamer lid. That was him today.. one exciting thing after the next.. he was even willing to try chicken feet but this is one of those dishes not done very well here. \n\nMy friend took me back to a time where I was younger and less experienced. He looked up to me to guide him through the noodles, bao and sui mai.. like a big brother.. I'm privileged that I could show him something new and exciting and he was so into it! So instead of feeling sorry for myself I felt experienced and useful.. that there is something I can give back to others.. that its not all about me and me aging but about what can be shared with others.\n\nThere is so much more to do, give and feel in this short time we are here.. and Ill do it to, one bite at a time.","The best to be found in land locked Arizona.  My favorite sticky rice is here.  They have dim sum every day, but not a huge selection, though you can order off the menu.  I think it is much bigger on the weekends.  I'm just happy I can get my fix 7 days a week.  Beautiful gardens to walk through, with fish ponds, and a 99 market next door!","I ate at Golden Buddha a few weeks ago.  We ate at the restaurant after a day at the zoo with our 4 year old and had a blast.  The piano bar played tunes for my daughter and the staff was more than accommodating.  The general tso chicken was better than anything I can get in Tucson.  The soup was chocked full of fresh, read FRESH, not canned, vegetables.  All in all, I was very satisfied with the meal and the service.  Plus the decor is very nice, clean and cheery. \n\nEat at Golden Buddha.","For those who gave this place low marks, forgive me. I really like this place. Now I haven't tried various dim sum places so I'm reserving the right to downgrade the place as needed. The variety of food is plentiful, and the carts just keep on coming. I love the steamed pork buns, and the shiu mai (not sure if I spelled that correctly). Yesterday, my favorite pick was the deep fried rolls of taro and shrimp. YUM! I have never ordered from their menu so I can only talk about their dim sum. My friends and I try to go eat dim sum almost every Sunday. It's a cheap way to try new foods, and if you don't like it, well.. you can get away with pushing it aside with minimal guilt. Give it a try! You might be surprised.","I like Golden Buddha, have taken many friends there for Dim Sum.  \nTry not to \"hit\" the dumpling cart to heavy; otherwise cannot finish it to the dessert cart (LOL).\nLove the jasmine tea and the staff willing to help you if you do not understand the what each item is.\nSingapore Rice Noodles a favorite, along with any of the shrimp dumplings; also the broccoli and green beans.\nOnly wish that the carts with eggplant stuffed with shrimp or green peppers with shrimp were not on \"heated\" carts; by the time it gets to you the food is cold.\nOnly concern is that went on 22MAY2010 at 1:30PM; there was a closed sign due to electricity???\nREVISED: 26MAY2010 - called this evening - looks like they are back open again.","I've been to the Golden Buddha on several occasions and it is my favorite, by far, for honest Chinese food. \nWhile I've sampled everything from their vegetarian to their beef, I love their mandarin chicken. More recently, I was delighted to relive the wonders of their Kung Pao Chicken and Beef with Broccoli. \nI absolutely love the egg drop soup and mini crab rangoons that come with the meal.","The very first time I went to Golden Buddha was with my BFF and it was our first dim sum experience. Little did I know this would forever change my life and eating experiences. Although I must admit that first time was a bit awkward.\n\nGB wisely takes reservations which was wonderful (even though it wasn't crazy busy). Our assorted dim sum plates were flavorful and fresh. And the carts seemed to be in constant rotation so we were never too far from a good selection.\n\nWhat really helps GB is its location. The Cofco Center is an experience in itself, where one can have herbs specially blended, select a fresh member of marine life to take home and cook or browse through a store with one of the largest selections of Buddhas and hand fans I've experienced outside of San Francisco.","I've been to Golden Buddha a few times and have not been disappointed. \n\nThey have a LARGE selection of Dim Sum and if you're not careful you can get carried away.\n\nTry and get there early and you'll get the best and most fresh selection.\nMake sure you walk around the garden when you're done.","Probably the most comprehensive Chinese menu in the Valley.  Pick from well over 100 dishes, but if you want the best order the Peking Duck.  Everything else is very good, but without a wow factor.  You'll see lots of Chinese people in this massive restaurant, which probably means they're doing a fine job in the kitchen.","I very much enjoyed eating here. Food was great. Fairly fast service. Wasn't expensive either for the 4 of us.","Golden Buddha has GREAT dim sum.  Their prices are reasonable and the staff is very polite wheeling their little carts.  I tend to go on the weekend because there is more selection but they do dim sum throughout the week.  They also have some very authentic dishes on the menu for those who are more of the adventurous types.  Be sure to say hello to the turtles the next time you go.","This place in the Chinese Cultural Center has a very pretty and elegant bar area. I was pleased to learn that they had some very reasonable and delicious happy hour snacks. This is a good place for a Pina Colada. I had one by myself along with some dumplings and fried shrimp appetizer. Sadly I never brought anyone else here with me. It was happy hour heaven but you know? A lot of my friends in AZ pretty much hang out in one neighborhood or another and nobody I know really lives close to the Buddha.\nThe airport is pretty close by. This might be a good pre-flight send-off location.","I have had dim sum in New Orleans and Phoenix (not SF), and this is about equal to the best of New Orleans as far as flavor.\nAs for ambiance, today was a good day. I've had dim sum here about a dozen times, and have had very good service and quality 90% of the time, including weekends. I have had bad days here, but since today was good, I'll rate accordingly. It's closer to a 4.5, but since I can't give half-stars, I rounded up.\nDon't expect me to give these the right names, but... I was less than impressed with the bbq pork balls. They tasted too much like honey and the beef was minimal. The bbq sauce tasted bottled. Outside of that, their herbal hot tea is delicious even on a hot day.\nThe shu mai were very good, and the shrimp in a spinach dumpling was fantastic. A definite don't miss is their sticky rice in lotus leaf. It's among the best I've had anywhere. Just be careful; you'll find bones in it every once in a while. Go for any of their steamed dumplings; they're very flavorful. As others have said, I love the Chinese broccoli, but you'll only find it on the carts on weekends. Otherwise order it off the menu.\nToday (11:30 lunch) the carts came around often, and everything except the pork buns was piping hot and fresh. By the way, despite the price increases, even the sticky rice was considered a medium size entree, and the two of us eating there escaped with a bill under $20 and we were done in under 30 minutes.\nI strongly recommend the dim sum here, whether you've had it a million times or have never had it before. You usually won't be disappointed.","I don't really understand the poor reviews on this place.....maybe it depends on the day you go? We went on a Sunday, it was crazy busy, but service was great! (of course, my view of customer service is a little different then the rest... I used to live on an island where you were just happy to find what you were looking for, let alone expect good customer service) Anyways, our server was very sweet! Always had a smile on her face. The carts served us promplty and none of the food was cold. They always had whatever we wanted (I hate having to wait for the next cart).\n\nNow, as for the actual dim sum and food.......holy cow, to die for! So flavorful and fresh!! The broccoli makes you sing...and the wine noodles, make you cry. You leave with very weird mixed emotions, but mostly a happy belly full of yummy food.\n\nIn my opinion, this is the best dim sum I have been able to find in Phx. I'm ditching my previous spot (Mekong Palace) and will be back to Golden Buddha when the dim sum monster strikes again!"],"type":["Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low

I had a horrible experience.  Vowed never to go back!  At that time, I even had a terrible interaction with the owner.\n\nThis time I was invited with a couple of girlfriends because they love it. Decided to try again since it was more about the \"get together\" than the food/location.\n\nThis time, overpriced food and bad service.  Overall, it was not anything out of the ordinary and not worth the price.   I had the veal speciality.   Large portion, but ok.  Staff was not very attentive for the small amount of customers present.\n\nI am a Pittsburgh native.  This is a bad neighborhood. \n\nI am NOT interested in ever going back!","No better in taste than a Fazoli or even an Olive Garden.  Inflated prices, like the cheapest entree was $40, try to disguise this place as something it is not.  Went with a group of co workers, so we pretty much got everything on the menu and not one thing stuck out really good.  Service is incredibly slow.  Not worth it at all.  Even if you tell yourself that atleast the portions are large, the food is just not good enough to warrant wasting a meal eating there.","The menu online gives no prices, and the entrees are ridiculously overpriced for what you get - a good meal, but far too much food, and nothing extraordinary. The entrees are $50 - $60. BE WARNED - if you want atmosphere to go with your $60 entree, you'd better REQUEST DOWNSTAIRS! Otherwise you can have your anniversary dinner in a small room in front of large televisions. Who knew? And the staff will definitely not accommodate your request for a more romantic spot - even if they know it is your tenth anniversary! Wow. Should have walked out.","I do not say this with many 2 star ratings but I would like to go back for another try.  The reason is simple, in reading the reviews below, I have to assume we hit Alla Famigilia on a bad night, at least I hope so.  The main reason for the low rating was the service.  We were seated on the third floor which is their bar area, at a high top table and the bar tender was our server.  She had to mix drinks for every table on the third floor, tend to the patrons at the bar and come around to wait on our table.  That was not fair to her and definitely not fair to us.  Her service and attentiveness lacked for obvious reasons but even when she was \"free\" she walked by our table without a glance and was apparently hard of hearing.  Furthermore, when ever one person got her attention for another drink or something, she said okay and left, without giving anyone else a chance to order.  The rest of the staff tried to pick up the slack a little but they were jammed as well.  Sounds weird, but I never felt so rushed in a 3 hour dinner.  The food took awhile, which is fine and expected on a busy Saturday night, just keep the drinks flowing and stop by once in a awhile so we don't notice.\n\nI also did not like that we were seated at a high top table.  I love the high tops for drinks and a few apps but for a 3 hour meal, these were uncomfortable, especially if your legs didn't hit the chair cross bars correctly (either too short or too tall).\n\nThe food was good, very good in some instances and disappointing in one.  I loved the pasta with Vodka sauce and the salad, both part of the entree which is unusual for a high end restaurant.  The meatball appetizer and the calamari and shrimp appetizer were the best things I ate all evening.  The biggest disappointment was the veal chop.  I love a good bone in veal chop but was leaning towards a seafood dish. I ended up changing my mind right before I ordered as I saw the veal chop brought out to another table and it looked amazing.  The disappointment was it was over-cooked.  It came out medium well at best (closer to well) and for $68, and for the amount they were serving that night, they should know how to cook them to perfection.  Not a spot of pink to be found.  No one even asked us during our meal if everything was okay or any issues.  When most of the chop remained on my plate and everyone else's entree was 90% eaten, not even a \"was everything okay\".  Just clear me out and get on with the next one.\n\nI hope to have the opportunity to go back and I will not be seated in the third floor bar area and I will not get my same waitress and give it another try.  I expected so much more.","We had the mushrooms, meatball appetizer, pasta, salad, veal piccata and spaghetti with clam sauce. A nice pasta dish with roasted veggies and marinara was made as a special order. But I was not wowed by this restaurant. Large portions are not enough to impress me. The tastes were good, but for the prices, I'd expect better. If you're a big meat eater, or love to eat huge amounts of pasta, ok, this is great. But the sauces were just ok, nothing spectacular. Spaghetti with clams was covered with red pepper flakes but not noted as such on the menu. Would you like someone to cover your pizza slice with red pepper flakes without asking? I'm sure the deserts are good but we didn't have any - but the sizes of the appetizers and entrees is just over the top, but not worth the premium prices to me.","The food was delicious. But it is a ridiculously expensive restaurant. If you're intimidated by spending $100 or more on a complete meal for 1 person, then this is not the place for you. Knowing that we had other plans for our evening, my date and I cut the meal short with appetizers, salad, and a bottle of one of the lesser expensive wines they offer, which was $54 a bottle. Our check was still $120, and we left hungry. Which is a shame, because the little of what we did have, we fully enjoyed. There are plenty of Italian restaurants in Pittsburgh, and many of them are very, very good - where one can enjoy a meal for a fraction of what it costs here.","This used to be my secret place, but I've told so many people about it that I have a hard time getting a reservation.  I've known Jonathan (chef/owner) for a few years and he's done some good improvements.  He's added a bar upstairs which is very cool and they also have a patio that's great.  I had a dinner party there in the summer and have another one planned in March and Jonathan totally goes the extra effort to make it special.  He arranged for a dj last time, so we were able to dance off some of his food.  Okay, the food is great.  I especially recommend the Veal Chop.  The staff is awesome. I really like Marney and Errol (two main servers) and I like Jordan the bartender upstairs (Marney's daughter).  I'd like to give this place 5 stars, but it has a few smaller problems.  It's a little bit pricey.  The good is that the cost does include salad, pasta, and bread, but the bad is that you'll easily spend $50 on an entree.  The Veal Chop is $65.  That's a little much, especially considering the location.  The dishes also which are delicious are simply toooooo big.  I mean literally you can three meals out of one entree,  I would suggest some smaller plates especially for the bar.  One last tip, even though it's not BYOB anymore, you can still BYOB.  He won't turn you away.  This is one of my favorite restaurants.  The chef is really talented and I'd hazard a guess that if he was in New York he could be a celebrity chef if he wanted.  He's got the personality.","The food is unforgettable, but unfortunately so is the bill.  Sicilian themed with fresh ingredients in an intimate setting all prepared in an open kitchen.\n\nAsk before you order a special, or you might be stunned when you are handed the check. But if you love food and money is no object, this is your place. A great place for Valentine's day or a special anniversary splurge, with the emphasis on the word 'splurge'.","Old school Italian. Enough said. This place sets the standard for great Italian food.\nThe meatballs are a muct have and the pastas are incredible.\nI had a veal chop with long hots. It just doesn't get any better.\nAnd don't miss the tiramisu. As good as it gets.","First, the Veal Milanese is easily the best veal chop I've had anywhere. Ever. And I've had plenty of veal.  Second, the veal chop is definitely in my top 5 favorite dishes I've ever had, ever. \n\nFantastic restaurant. The relatively new chef has made this place even better than it was. This is THE most underrated restaurant on Yelp in Pittsburgh. Great service, extremely friendly staff, fantastic atmosphere.\n\nBe sure to come hungry. You cannot leave unsatisfied. Meals typically last me 3-4 hours, but I take my time. BYOB is a bonus too. \n\nIn summary, Alla Famiglia is consistently the best restaurant in Pittsburgh. Try it if you have not, and you won't be disappointed.","I have been frequenting Alla Famiglia since 2007 and it is still my favorite Italian restaurant in Pittsburgh and perhaps my favorite in the world!  \n\nChef Jonathan is a genius - his \"Veal Chop Milanese\" with lump crab, toasted pine nuts, and lemon is the BEST I've ever had.  Every time we eat here, my husband orders this dish and refuses to try anything else - that's how AMAZING it is.  \n\nI have tried a variety of entrees - everything from the the Veal Chop Pizzaiolo to the Steak il pizzaiolo to the Medallions of veal Pomodoro ai Pepperoni.  Each dish is infused with deliciousness that makes these entrees OUT OF THIS WORLD!  \n\nYou have got to try the following:  mozzarella (apptz), hot peppers (apptz), mozzarella stuffed meatball (apptz), vodka pasta (automatically received with your meal - sauce is delicious), veal chop milanese (entr\u00e9e).  \n\nYou won't be disappointed - the kitchen is open so you can even watch as Chef Jonathan prepares your dinner.  \n\nMake a reservation.  Neighborhood is a bit sketchy so be careful.  \n\nPS.  I've taken all my friends, family, and business partners (many who do not live in Pittsburgh) here and everyone absolutely loves it and wishes they lived in Pitt so they could come here more often.  In fact, we no longer live in Pittsburgh, but every time we come into town for a visit, we HAVE to eat dinner at our favorite Alla Famiglia!","This is my second review of Alla Famalgia and again this place gets five stars. I loved every part of my meal. I started out with the twelve ounce stuffed meatball and the truffled mushroom appetizers. The waiter invited me to watch as the mushrooms were being prepared at the kitchen counter. There I chatted with the chef as he prepared my app. Explaining as he went on, first slicing fresh chantrel, portobellos, and button mushrooms. Next he saut\u00e9 them in olive oil, added brown sugar, brandy, raisins, and finished it with heavy cream. They were fantastic. There were a variety of specials including wild boar chops, a risotto with prawns, scallops, and black truffles. But I chose the dry aged filet with lump crab in a leek cream. It was the best piece of filet I've ever had. It was easily a pound of beef and a half pound of crab in a light cream sauce with leeks. I could barely touch it after the pasta, salad, bread, and appetizers. I brought my leftovers home and have them another time. Dessert consisted of a nice portion of carrot cake with an apricot cream cheese icing with apricot jam filling. It was a nice take on an old favorite. For the four of us the bill was over 300 dollars, but well worth it for the attentive service and extremely well prepared food.","Spent the weekend in the city with some friends. This was our first time to Alla Famiglia.  Unbelievable!!!  We enjoyed everything.  If you are looking for high quality food with a great friendly staff, this is it.  It is a little out of the way but it is worth the trip.  If I had the option to give 6 stars I would do it.   Very impressive.","While visiting the Pittsburgh area, my wife and I were intrigued by the excellent reviews we found of Alla Familgia.  While it was a bit of a drive from Cranberry Township, we needed a dining reprieve after a disappointing visit at BRAVO! Cucina Italiana.  East Warrington Avenue is undergoing major construction which made finding parking a bit difficult, fortunately there is valet service in a lot to the side of the restaurant which we took advantage of.  \nUpon entering, we were warmly welcomed by the host.  We visited on a stormy evening and were fortunate to find that some reservations had been cancelled due to the weather, which enabled us to get a table.  I strongly advise to get reservations in advance.  We were seated on the first floor with a view of the chefs cooking.  Awesome.\nAll that has been said in prior reviews, I heartily agree with.  The bread, cheese, and dipping oil was a delicious start.  Ingredients were fresh.  The pasta and main course dishes were done perfectly.  My wife had the Gorgonzola Filet Mignon, which she described as one of the best meals she has ever eaten.\nWhen we are in the area, we'll be back.","I was in Pittsburgh (my hometown) for a visit from Boston.  I was so pleased with the meal at this restaurant.  It was by far the best restaurant I have ever been to in the Burgh.  The wait staff, chef, food, was stellar.  We are known for very good restaurants in Boston and this restaurant could be in Boston or NYC it is that fantastic!  I would highly recommend going here if you have a special occasion, date night, or just want a superb meal.","FACT: Thee best Italian meal I've had in the Burgh, hands down!\nFACT: I ate so much I thought they would have to wheel me out on a stretcher.\nFACT: It's a serious hidden gem in a slightly sketchy neighborhood.\n\nNeed some more info, because I'm comin' atcha with the goods! To start they set the table with \"Holy Oil,\" which is banana pepper olive oil for dipping Italian bread in, a seasoned cecci bean and cheese gustoso and a goat cheese and olive spread. I wish they sold that banana pepper olive oil because I wanted to have it every day of my life! \n\nWe ordered the famous Meatball appetizer. This meatball is for serious! It's massive and stuffed with mozzarella cheese. Yep, I'm for realz. It was just oozing Italian sexiness, in a ball. As soon as I tasted the red sauce, it tasted like my Grandma's, which sparked fond memories and made me want to actually live in this place. \n\nWe also ordered the Trifolata, which is assorted mushrooms and currants in marsala cream. It was also incredible. The bad/good of it was that it wasn't really needed because they give you so much food, but it was delicious, so whatever!\n\nFor the Third course they serve you your choice of pasta either with their famous home made vodka sauce or fettucini. But here's the thing, the fettucini is made in front of you... in a cheese wheel. Yep, I'm for realz again! I know I'm crazy for not ordering it, but I really love me some vodka sauce and was incredibly happy with this amazing homemade sauce. My hubby got the fetticini and loved it. See, we're all happy here!\n\nFourth course is a salad with red vinagariette, roasted red peppers, candied walnuts, golden raisens and gargonzola cheese. It wasn't memorable amongst all the bangin' dishes but not too shabby at all.\n\nFor the Fifth course (and when I finally tapped out) I ordered the Cioppino with shrimp, mussels, clams, scallops and fish in a saffron and tomato broth with sambuca. It matched all the other dishes. Just incredible. Loved the broth, loved the succulent scallop (just one, but I can't complain, I was stuffed by that point!), the shrimp was jumbo and the fish was perfectly cooked. And the garlic bread was excellent.\n\nWhenever anyone says things are expensive, I usually think they're talking $30 a plate. But, this place is legit expensive. Think $50 (ish) a plate. But what I can tell you is it was 100% worth it! We had leftovers for two days! Talk about an Italian hospitality. Which, by the way, the service was exceptional, but I would have expected that here. \n\nA perfect special night out, if you don't mind unbuckling a couple notches in front of your dining companion, of course!","Absolutely incredible restaurant! It is by far my favorite restaurant in the city. Everything about this place is fantastic especially their Veal Chop Milanese, the restaurant is pretty pricey but 100% well worth the money. I recommend this restaurant to anyone who is looking for a fantastic Italian meal.","This is my favorite place to eat!  The greens and beans, the meatball, and the hot cheese for appetizers are excellent.  I love the pasta with a dash of the oil they give you. The Alfredo in the cheese wheel is an excellent alternative to red sauce.   I've tried just about every dish there and never had a bad meal.  The Veal Chop is by far my favorite.  Huge portions which usually come home!! ;)\nThe atmosphere is a very quaint three story house, use valet parking, because the area is not the best! Lol but the police station is a cross the street. So it's all good!   \nThis is the perfect place for a great meal with great service for any function or just date night!","Possibly the best Italian Restaurant I've ever been too.  The Vodka Sauce was phenomenal.  I finished the evening with a  Fernet Branca.....perfection.","This is one of if not the best meals I have ever had.   I have only gone as part of work functions (about 3 different occasions) and every time we get the upstairs private room.  The service is fantastic.  I always have the Veal Chop Milanese which is AMAZING.  They also have a delicious pasta as an appetizer which has a little spice to it.  You will not find a better meal in Pittsburgh.  I have no idea what the prices actually are as I have never paid but it is definitely very pricey.  The neighborhood is real grimey but don't let that dissuade you from going there.","Their prices are exorbitant but so worth it. I've only had Italian this good in NY, LA, and Italy. No wonder there are pictures of celebrities all over the walls. What a hidden gem. $260 for two? Money well spent.","UPDATED: Just wanted to share that we attempted to visit for a third time when my husband's brother was in town in mid-November of 2014.  We had reservations for 7:30 on a Tuesday, so we obviously figured we would be seated immediately.  The brother and his girlfriend arrived a couple minutes before the reservation and were told to go up to the bar while they set the table and wait for the rest of the party.  I arrived about a minute after and my husband a few minutes behind me as he needed to park due to the lack of valet during the week.  There was no one at the host stand when either of us came in.  So we went up to the bar, declined a drink... and waited, and waited.  The bartender soon became deeply involved in picking a wine for a couple at the bar, not his fault.  The brother eventually was able to flag down a waitress to ask if she could check on our table.  She looked very annoyed.  She eventually went over to the phone at the bar, called down, hung up the phone and said, dead pan, \"no, it's not ready yet.\"  Not a smile, not a sorry, not a \"can we get you a drink on the house?\" Meanwhile, there was an open table for 4 on that floor.  The bartender eventually told us \"that's for a reservation.\" \"Yes, we have a reservation... for 25 minutes ago.\"  \"They must have specifically requested that table.\"  They did, however, offer us the table right next to the door on the first floor though - the one with the 10 degree breeze coming in that night.  No thank you.  We were very insulted by the lack of table for our reservation, but more so by the lack of acceptable service.  We decided to leave and spend $20 on pizza instead of $100+ per person and enjoyed much better service.. which is never the way it should be.  Hopefully they solve this problem soon.  We'll give it one more go when the insult has worn off.\n\nMy husband won't hesitate to tell you what his favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh is: Alla Famiglia.  And to be honest, these days I agree with him!  \n\nWhile my husband enjoys many of the more \"up and coming\" restaurants with smaller portions and interesting flavor combinations, he often finds himself longing for the same quality food with better cuts of meat and bigger portions.  This is where we satisfy both of our appetites for big flavor and, well, big portions.  But to reduce Alla Famiglia to those two things alone would not do it justice.\n\nLet's start out instead with addressing the two biggest critiques of this place: its location and the price.  Yes, it is in Allentown, but they also have plenty of parking and valet if you prefer.  Honestly, we drive almost everywhere to get dinner, so this is not an issue for us.  The other thing I always hear about is how expensive it is.  Some of those complaints come from people who I know have no problem giving their money to the big steakhouse chains, while getting a lot less value.  No, it is not cheap.  You will likely pay upwards of $50 for your entry.  The veal chops are close to $70.  But, that's not all you get.  You get delicious, fresh baked bread, a spread, dipping oil and gustoso for same, a delicious salad, and homemade pasta served family style.  If you wanted to be especially frugal, you could approach this place like an Olive Garden senior special: feast on the freebies and take your entree to go.  But, even if you're full, it may be too difficult not to savor the meal as it comes out...\n\nI've been here twice and my husband has been here three times (lucky - he got to go for work and he said they ordered almost every appetizer, all of which were apparently delicious).  The first time I ordered the filet with gorgonzola.  It was one of the most delicious and largest filets I've ever had.  My husband ordered a veal chop with prosciutto which I don't think I recognized on the current menu, but he absolutely loved it.  The veal chop is one of the largest bone-in cuts of meat I've seen and the sear on it was absolutely perfect.  We also ordered the mussels, which were spicy and delicious, and the meatball appetizer, which I remember being tasty, but nothing too out of the ordinary.  I think there are other things on the menu to try first. \n\nThe second time we came I ordered the Milanese veal chop, breaded, slightly citrusy, and absolutely heavenly.    He had the cowboy ribeye which was also large and an absolutely beautiful cut of meat.  The husband has a thing about fatty cuts and avoiding anything that is the least bit chewy, and he barely had to leave a piece on his plate.  We also got the calamari appetizer, which was perfectly, lightly fried with a savory, garlic sauce that sets it apart from the sweet sauces often served with calamari.\n\nFinally, I should note that the service we have received here has always been exceptional.  Everyone is always professional and courteous.","After a friend told me about her wonderful experience here, I knew I had to go. I also knew that it wasn't really in my budget. Well, lucky for me an old college friend of mine decided that he was coming to town for a visit. I sent him the websites for various restaurants and when he saw Alla Famiglia he said, \"Oh honey. Make the reservation - I've got it.\"  YES! I knew I kept him around for some reason!\n\nSo on a cold, snowy Saturday night, we trudged up the mountain. And it was glorious.\n\nFirst off, it IS in a bit of a sketchy neighborhood. But no worries - they have valet, so you don't have to deal with trying to find somewhere to park and walking around.\n\nThe Holy Oil is the best thing I've ever dipped bread into - and I'm a dipper. I come from an Italian family - we dip everything into everything - bread into sauce, cookies into coffee, bread into coffee, etc. This is by far the best dipping experience I've ever had.\n\nOnto the MEATBALL. We got the mozzarella-stuffed meatball for our appetizer. The meatball was good. The sauce was great. There isn't much more I can say about it, to be honest. It was just so, so yummy.\n\nSalad course: Great salad!\n\nPasta course: So, I was slightly disappointed that they did not give us a choice. I was really looking forward to the fettuccine in the cheese wheel that I had read about here! Alas, only vodka sauce. Great vodka sauce, though. I should've asked about that damn cheese wheel...\n\nFor the main course, I got the veal chop milanese and it was perfect. My friend got the cioppino and he enjoyed that very much.\n\nI could not even think about eating dessert. We had so much food. I took 1/2 of my pasta course and 3/4 of my main course home. I really wish I had gotten a dessert to go and eaten it later, though. \n\nI really cannot wait to go again.","I was in Pittsburgh my home town for a recent stay.  Alla Famiglia is the best restaurant I have been to in the Burgh.  It was consistent with the type of upscale dining I have gotten used to in Boston and I was pleasantly surprised.  The area surrounding the restaurant does not seem to be the safest locale, but worth going there for a wonderful dinner.  The service was exceptional!  The food was amazing with cheese plates, bread and side for the bread basket, meatball appetizer, cowboy steak with gorgonzola, and the halibut.  The tiramisu was the best I have had.  The addition of BYOB was a hidden gem as well.  I would highly recommend this for a special night out to celebrate.  Fantastic restaurant.","Simply outstanding...we had a large group (11) and everything was perfect. Several comments that this was the best Italian cuisine several of our group had experienced anywhere in the world.  Can't wait to go back!\n\nThe famous Meatball app did not disappoint (my fav was the stuffed peppers) and the many preparations of veal (main courses) were all exquisite.  \n\nAbsolutely recommend for any and all who are considering this fantastic establishment!","Just recently returned. PHENOMENAL meal! Glenn our waiter was superb. Loved the veal dishes.  I also enjoyed the new cocktail menu. One of the drinks was iced coffee with orangicello and frangelica cream. DELICIOUS!","This restaurant was phenomenal.   We went for my wife's 30th birthday with a large group of people and it was a great experience.  \n\nThe meatball and fried cheese appetizers were really good.  The marinara that came with the meatball was the best I have ever had.\n\nDon't go here if you are in a rush, because the entire dining experience will take several hours.  But we were there to enjoy the night, so we did not care.\n\nI would definitely recommend this to anyone as long as you are willing to spend the money.  If you do  appetizers, drinks and dinner it will run about $100 a person.  But I thought it was well worth it.\n\nThe wait staff was great.  Our server was Emmett and we had a lot of fun with him.  The owner/chef even came out and chatted with us on the upstairs outdoor patio.","My favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. Always delicious and I always order a different entree.

There was more than enough sauce mmmmmmmmm.","My fiance & I have lived in downtown Pittsburgh for over a year + now & this place is fabulous. \nMy sweetie LOVES LOVES LOVESSS pizza & we order from here a ton.

waiter was to be found about ten minutes later they gave us our water and left again! It wasn't even busy! There were only TWO dim sum carts floating around somewhere. Then our waiter finally came around and took our orders of lunch entrees. The food was not even that good as the reviews that are posted on here. When we came up to pay, the bill was super overpriced. I will not be returning here, I am better off eating at Great Wall Cuisine.","If this place had zero stars I would have given them that ! Let me start off by saying I was so excited to read all great reviews so maybe I just came in on a off day? We walked in and were seated came over and asked if we wanted water or tea I guess they don't serve anything Else, Then we placed an order pork dumplings and sticky rice nasty! Then I asked if they served egg rolls they said they were out!!! they pushed their little carts around with hot plates that basically steam the food and is not fresh and what you get is soggy poor customer service we had to get up and look for someone to give us our tab so we could get the heck out of there are get some real food. It looked like it would be a great place for groups of people would not recommend if you are on mission for what you want and want to place an order but it could be a fun experience for some people.","You walk into a Chinese restaurant on a Saturday afternoon for dim sum and you expect the place to be PACKED.  Well, walking in to a pretty much empty dining room, it's a VERY CLEAR SIGN.  But my friend insisted and I was very hesitant for good reasons.  Another indicator, the majority of the patrons were NON Asian.  \n\nFood: You walk in and you see carts of the food by the entrance to the dining room.  Umm, I thought dim sum should come right off the steamer and into the carts and they roll it around, not sitting around.  The dim sum was garbage.  It had the typical selection, but at minimum.  \n\nService: It's ok.  But it doesn't make up for the horrible food.\n\nBottom line: NO WAY!  Stay away!","I've been here many times...Mother's Day with family, dim sum with book club, etc. But I will not go back again.  I stopped in to ask the owner about a donation or reduced price for a class of under-privileged kids that I volunteer with.  His reaction was to scoff and shoo me out the door while handing me his card and saying I could email him.  He turned his back and headed off to the messy newspaper-strewn table he haunts between guests arrivals.  Maybe he's a community-minded business owner, but then again, maybe he's not.  I'll be dining elsewhere.","Being from Chicago, we are used to getting authentic Chinese food all the time.  But when we first starting spending a lot of time in Scottsdale/Phoenix, we found it a challenge to get authentic Chinese food.  We were excited to find the Golden Buddha and have made many trips over the years all the way from the Troon North area to get our fix.  However, service has declined to the point where it is no longer worth the aggravation.  We went there last night for Chinese New Year and will never go back.  Granted they were very busy because of a lot of large tables there, but waiting almost an hour to get our food is not acceptable under any circumstance!  45 mins. into our wait, the waitress came back (after we flagged her down to ask about our food) and said one of the dishes we ordered was not available....after 45 mins.!!!! What makes the whole experience an unforgivable one is that the manager/owner is so indifferent and never apologized or offered a discount off the bill...nothing.  When we left, the same manager was at the piano singing in Chinese. Huh?  Other than Nee House in Scottsdale, the search goes on for a restaurant that serves authentic Chinese food closer to home.","I will NEVER go there again.  I reserved a table for a group of 16 people for 5:00 PM on Christmas Eve .  The person on the phone ( I believe the manager) repeatedly asked me to call ahead and give him an accurate head count since he said they'd be swamped that day.  I followed up with him twice.  \nWhen the first couple of us arrived, we had menus shoved in our faces immediately and told we \"Must order now.  Must order now\" because they were going to be busy later on.  The place was practically empty.  As each person arrived, they were treated the same way. \nWe rushed and placed our orders and then they brought out our checks WAY before we saw any sign of our food.  I have never in my life been treated so rudely by a restaurant.\nIt was utter chaos when the food started coming out while everyone struggled to get the correct dish they ordered.  One person didn't get her food until we were all just about finished eating. \nOne top of all that, the food wasn't even good.  I've had better Kung Pao Chicken at Panda Express!\nAfter being rushed through our meal, the place wasn't even half full by the time we left.  I thought being at the Cultural Center, this restaurant would be a sure thing but boy was I wrong.  Lovely way to spend Christmas Eve..","If you are looking a chinese restaurant to host a big party look some other than the Golden Buddah.  I recently attended a banquet at the Golden Buddah and I was shocked at the level of quality of food and service.  Of the 10 dishes served 4 were nearly inedible.  \n\nThere was a crab claw appetizer, most chinese restaurants prepare this dish by taking a crab claw surrounding it with ground shrimp, batter and then deep fry.  At Golden Buddah, the crab claw served was mostly batter.  \n\nThe shark fin soup served was mostly broth.  Shark fin is an expensive ingredient and most places usually use imitation shark fin, but come on at least put something in there so that I know I'm eating soup and not dirty sink water.  \n\nGinger scallion lobster is battered, fried, and then stir fried in a sauce with ginger and scallions.  The ginger scallion lobster served was over-cooked and dried out.  \n\nLastly, there was a steamed fish.  The fish was raw in the middle.   \n\nIt wasn't all bad, there was a crispy chicken with garlic dish that was pretty good, but out of 10 dishes 4 were bad, 5 were okay, and 1 was good.  \n\nDoes 4 bad dishes out of 10 warrant a one star rating?  Well it does when you factor in the service.  The soup, appetizer, and first entree arrived timely, but after that there was a 1 hour gap before we received the next dish.  The dishes were not served with accompanying white rice which I thought was odd.  We had to ask for it, and even the rice took a while to arrive.","I agree with Crystal C., that the dim sum isn't the greatest I've ever had. In fact, I am not sure if the meal was so tasty that it was memorable. I do remember the \"calamari\" was not really calamari, like you would think. It was presented more like a sweet and sour pork (so calamari with LOTS of breading) without any sauce. As a result, the dish was dry and salty.\n\nThe sticky rice was good (hard to mess up), the chicken feet were okay (needed more five spice powder), and the shumai was alright. The noodles were good, and I can see why the cart ran out after the first round. The diners were an equal mix of Asians and Americans. I would've preferred to see more Asians eating (as I am used to in a Chinatown and gives an indication of authenticity), but I do realize we're in Phoenix where the Asian population is not like San Francisco or Houston. \n\nThe meal came to about $30 for two, including jasmine tea. The carts are loud because they are made out of metal and roll on tile. I am also not used to staff members shouting what they have in their cart, like a newspaper boy yelling \"Extra! Extra!\" Christmas music was playing after mid-January, so the atmosphere felt strange. Next time I visit the city, I probably will pass.","Can't say that I was very impressed. Came for dinner in a hopeful and enthusiastic mood since the reviews have been pretty good, but I don't think this place lives up to its current good, but declining rating.\n\nOrdered the Combo fried rice (shrimp, chicken, beef, pork), sesame chicken, and garlic fried chicken. \n\nThe combo fried rice was pretty good, but ended up drinking about 6 glasses of water due to the MSG and sodium content. You'd think that the cook spent his better years in the French Foreign Legion in the Sahara eating salt tablets and developed a taste for them. \n\nThe sesame chicken had a good flavor and a thick brown sweet sauce. I liked it a lot until it got cool and the sauce looked (with that stringy consistency) more like glue. You think I'm kidding? I'm not.\n\nGarlic fried chicken was bad. Just bad. It was like an over roasted dried out half chicken with some dried garlic pieces sprinkled on top. No spices, no flavor, no good. \n\nWe then got all kinds of lip from the waitress when we asked if they could change the channel on the TV from college football, to the Suns game. They made it into this big deal that the \"customers\" wanted to see the football game. Yeah right, it was University of West Virginia Vs. University of Connecticut! I would have believed it if it was a local team....\n\nIt's better than a 1 star joint, but only because it's borderline edible. To be avoided.","This restaurant is located in the Chinese Cultural Center and was the one restaurant that I had not been to. So after some shopping at one of the shops, we stepped in to have dinner.\n\nWe stepped in and asked for a seat for two. We were seated immediately. The place was decorated nicely and a lady playing the piano made for great ambiance.\n\nWe looked at the menu briefly and ordered our drinks, an appetizer, a soup and two main dishes. The drinks came out promptly and so did the rest of the meal. My goodness everything we ordered was very tasty.\n\nThe waiter service itself however was not even close to the decor and food. He never introduced himself, and although he took our order, our food itself was brought out by a kitchen person.\n\nAfter we ordered our waiter really never came back asking if we needed anything else, except to give us our check at the end and that was after the person I was dining with got up and asked a different waiter for it.\n\nIt's amazing how a place with great food, decor, and ambiance can mess it all up by crappy waiter service.","I love Dim Sum, my favorite Chinese dish.\n\nWhen Golden Buddha first open, they have excellent Dim sum. I went there many times, I tell my friend how good it is, But now,  they change cook, taste more like  week old left over. Rumor has it, they change cook every few month, so Quality of cooking change. (not sure if that is true, but that is what I was told.)\nMy advice is; when you walk in the door and the place is pack, = Good Cook. if the place is bare = bad cook. leave immediately. don't waste your money.","If you just \"want\" dim sum, go here. If you are \"craving\" dim sum, go elsewhere (take a 5 hour drive west to neighboring state, California).\n\nAnyway, I've been visiting Golden Buddha in the noontime for roughly 2 years now. I believe they moved from their original site (7th St. & Osborn), formerly \"China Doll.\" Relocation brought along better atmosphere and smiling faces. This does not mean, better dim sum. But since we are in Phoenix, I will settle for what they have to offer. \n\nBe mindful of the dim sum tab. It's itemized high-medium-low. \n\nShaomai can be found as combinations of pork/mushroom, shrimp, or shark fin (which should not be confused as true shark bits, as the shaomai is prepared to look like a shark's fin). These picks are okay...perhaps on a better day shao mai will be served in less-rigid, or fresher wrappers. Potstickers are okay as well, just the usual scallion and pork, and dry wrapper. The baby pork ribs in light black bean sauce and jalapenos is alright, but sometimes lacks in taste. Tripe is also served in its bare minimum...so if you enjoy the texture and flavor of tripe, try this with its clear sauce and thinly sliced carrots and celery.  \nBuche (that's what I call it), or fried sesame balls are also available, although if you wait until dessert, they will also be a bit stiff. There are a few other things that may be \"spotted\" but are not worth mentioning. \n\nDon't order from their lunch menu, as you can find these over-salted dishes at Panda Express anyway. \n\nOverall, dim sum at Golden Buddha is a place to go if you are around the vicinity and feel like having something apart from the usual fast food. However, discriminating palates- beware.","Not impressed with this place at all. This was not the friendliest place around, maybe because of the language barrier (most or all were clearly native Chinese speakers), or maybe just the attitude of the employees.\n\nI ordered the sweet and sour chicken lunch, which came with the typical egg drop soup, crab rangoon, and egg roll. The soup was ok - maybe it's just me, but I prefer a real spoon to the scoop that they gave me. The egg roll was tiny and not that great, and the crab rangoon was ok, but maybe a little undercooked. The chicken wasn't bad, but nothing special, as was the rice and other stuff on the plate.\n\nOverall, this was just not my kind of Chinese place.","Disappointing.  Mediocre at best.  I am staying at the Aloft hotel in phoenix and ordered some delivery. I ordered a couple american chinese food staples: general tso's chicken, dumplings and hot&sour soup.  Soup had zero flavor, dumplings tasted freezer burned and processed.  General tso chicken was ehh. \n\nA lot of good reviews on here so it must be for eat in and for their dim sum.  Don't order delivery, you will be left hungry and unsatisfied.","Went there on Saturday for early lunch.  My wife did the dim sum, it was okay, we were both disgusted by the sugar cane shrimp; but the rest was good.  \n\nI ordered the chicken szechwuan, the waitress warned me it was \"spicy\" the reason I ordered it.  It came out delicious, but not what I would call spicy.  Overall its hard to find good Chinese in the valley and I would call this good without hesitation.","So I was referred to this place from the front desk of my hotel. I'm from SF so I'm coming from a place with really good chinese food. \n\nThe dim sum is just \"ok\" nothing for me to write home about. The one dish that I really liked was the chinese broccoli cooked with garlic sauce. Yum yum yum.  It's in a big bowl, not oily, not saucy, just really good. I think it's $7.50.  \n\nIt's a somewhat pricey and just like all chinese restaurants, it's not the cleanest.  The chair was filthy.  the dishes weren't all that great.  I wouldn't go back unless I want the chinese broccoli.  \n\nSo I went on a Sunday and it was not crowded at all. There's not a huge asian population  in Phoenix (not that I could tell) so I don't think there's a high demand for dim sum.  And also, I sooooooo felt like taking a pic of this, but a Mexican lady was pushing one of the dim sum carts. That is unheard of in SF.  This is a mainly mandarin restaurant and the dim sum places I go are usually cantonese.  Not a big deal though since the dishes look the same. \n\nDude, there was a turtle in the fish tank that I saw as I left.  I hope they don't eat that!","A Premier Chinese Atmosphere,\nThe Chinese cultural center and Asian Garden produces an Asain atmosphere that can be recognized from the 202.  \n With Dim Sum served this location earns its respect from the local community.\n\nDim Sum tip,  You have to be smart with the Dim Sum ladies they look nice innocent but they are professional sales people that will sell you more dishes than you need before you know what to do.  \n\nI love the desserts here ask the server to see the dessert tray.","This restaurant has a bit of an identity crisis. It is in the Chinese cultural center, but serves Japanese beer (Kirin on tap!) and the live piano music is American pop. We had to ask for chopsticks.\n\nHaving said that, the service was professional. Our waiter held a hot appetizer for one of our party who was away from the table so that it would not be cold when he returned. We were asked frequently--and not too frequently--if things were ok both by our waiter and the manager/proprietor.\n\nThe food was ok-to-good. Fried shrimp egg rolls were dainty but yummy. Duck was tasty but very chewy. Kung-pao chicken was pleasantly spiced. Plenty of rice. A pitcher of ice water with lemon was left at the table. \n\nAtmosphere was also pleasant. Chairs comfortable, tables spaced well, restrooms large and clean...and there is indeed a large golden Buddha by the entrance.","I took a group of friends here and relatives other times. The place is consistently good for Dim-sum during lunch. It is typical Chinese and nothing fancy.\n\nWhat helps this place is the moat scenery.  3 stars for visiting here based on convenience since there are similar places in town.","Having grown up in Hong Kong and having eaten dim sum in London, NY, LA, SF and Vancouver (actually Richmond), I can confidently say I know my dim sum.\n\nGood selection of well-executed dim sum when the carts actually come around and there's anything left in it.  I'd give it 4 stars for food but the wait definitely detracted from the whole experience.\n\nI think the problem with Golden Buddha is that they can't handle the heavy flow on weekends.  There's not enough regular dim sum eaters like LA that can sustain a steady flow of diners throughout the week, forcing restaurants like Golden Buddha to depend heavily on extra part-time help on weekends.  \n\nDim sum takes serious skill so the chef still ends up doing most of the work.  When we looked into the kitchen, we saw a Chinese woman doing most of the cooking herself.  No wonder it took forever for a cart to come out and when it does, it's swarmed on by a pack of vultures.\n\nIf you're willing to eat at a more simply decorated place with a smaller menu, I'd highly recommend China Chan.  It's much more relaxed - usually no wait on weekends.  An experienced chef makes all the dim sum himself so the menu's much shorter but all the classics are on it.  Anything steamed is made to order so is very fresh.","Situated in the Chinese Cultural Center near the SkyHarbor Airport, this was another pleasant find. All I had was the Dim Sum menu, and I would say this is the best you're gonna get in Phoenix. Still worth the stop to get your Dim Sum fix. The cart ladies were pleasant and very happy to converse with me in Cantonese. Only downside was the chicken sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaves, naw mei gai, was way overcooked, and mushy.","Do you want to eat Chinese Food in an elegant environment on a Friday night in Phoenix? \n\nBe entertained by classic, quiet standards being played live on a piano while you dine?\n\nAre you 50 years old and Caucasian?\n\nThen the Golden Buddha is the place for you! \n\nIts in the Chinese Cultural Center Mall on 44th, and a popular weekend spot for Dim Sum. For a DIm Sum starved Valley of the Sun, Golden Buddha's is decent. \n\nFor dinner, though, it is awfully Americanized and not very authentic Chinese. But with a bunch of American customers coming for dinner, what do you expect? They probably think they are getting \"real Chinese\" food by going to the Chinese Mall, but then again, they are used to PF Chang's or Stix normally in their neighborhood, so this is a step up.\n\nThe best thing about this place is the decor, which is clean and nice, with a Hong Kong Junk boat design covering the ceiling from the bar into the dining room. The next best thing is the Piano interludes on weekend nights. The service is next, which is a little overly eager to remove your plate, and the last thing is the food. \n\nThey do give decent portions. I ordered Guo Teh (potstickers) and got 6 fat ones. But they weren't served with the usual soy, chili oil and vinegar, but a soy and green onions mixture. The Mapo Tofu was ok, as they used a nice silky tofu, which was nice, but no green onions, and sliced black mushrooms instead, which I like, but not in this dish.\n\nCome here for the ambiance and music in the evenings, or on the weekend days for Dim Sum.","Decent dim sum, especially to be found in the middle of the desert. Sadly, the best food I've had in Phoenix.","This place is a little difficult for me to review.  I was staying at the Hampton Inn across the street and this is the closest restaurant so off I went.\n\nI walked in and the owner or manager met me at the door and asked \"how many\"?\n\nI told him I wanted to order take out and handed me a menu and pointed to the waiting area which was covered in newspapers.  I chose to go to the bar, order a glass of wine, and peruse the menu.\n\nThe drinks are expensive but I didn't think the food was.  Less than $10 for my Mongolian Chicken which came with white sticky rice and a fortune cookie.  When ordering I asked if I could have fried rice instead of white rice but was told \"no\".  Most places allow this for a nominal fee.\n\nFine by me.  Give the white rice.  Food was prepared and their to-go boxes were a lot better than the standard white Chinese \"to go\" boxes.  They also included the plastic-ware, napkin, and soy sauce, which a lot of places forget.\n\nLooking around I found a whole lot of goodness along with a couple disappointments.  Most notably the newspaper strewn about and behind the bar, to the right were a lot of boxes stacked in an unsightly fashion.  I could have been a little more presentable in my opinion.\n\nI peeked into the dining room because I wanted to see if the piano music was piped in or live.  It was live which was very nice. Also, the dinning room looked very nice and cozy.\n\nAs I was leaving the same man who greeted me upon entering made sure to wish me a good evening.  My initial impression of the man was that he was surly and testy but that's just how he comes off.\n\nThe food was very good.  The Mongolian sauce was mixture of sweet with spice and the chicken and vegetables all tasted fresh.","My husband and I went there Saturday, the service was great!  Our friends were going to be late so they told us to start.  And start we did!\nThey were serving Dim Sum, something we had never tried, so glad we did, it was wonderful, hubby wouldn't do the chicken feet, but I think next time I will, it looked very good.\nOur friends showed up and ordered their food, and ate all of it, they said that usually they take food home, but it was so good they had to eat all of it!\nWe will be going back very soon!","Let's see, over 50... check \nold white man...........check \neats dinner ...............check \nlistens to the piano  check \n\nwow this must be the place for me, I mean after all it is in a Chinese mall, no make that a Chinese Cultural Center. How could I possibly have discerning taste with such trickery to get me here to eat. \nDude if you are going to rate a restaurant no need to degrade others with your arrogance. \nFool is my review of wanugee N. \n\nNow on the restaurant. The last time we were here the food was not good, the piano was too loud and the waitress had a real attitude. IT won't keep me from going back as I have had good meals and wait service too. \n\nBack to wanugee N. I do not expect any place in Phx. to have authentic Chinese food, by that I mean the street food one finds in China. \nBut I do expect what I fork in to my mouth is worth what I am going to fork over in cost. Even an old white guy like me can tell the difference between good and bad food. No matter what it is called.","Okay so Ive been glum the past few days as I have an impending birthday. Every year this time I get all down in the dumps.. not that I'm not happy with my life cause life is good. Its more like getting further away from my youth and closer to being well, old. All of my grandparents were crotchety, sourpuss drama queens.. is that my fate? Can I break the mold or am I to going to be a crotchety sourpuss?\n\nSo as I contemplate and figure out what I'm going to do with my birthday baggage I decide to squash it with food. All weekend Ive been eating out and having a good time. This is one of the few times outside of a vacation where I will live it completely and to the near of sheer gluttony. So why not dim sum? \n\nIve chowed much dim sum in my 36 years of earthen wear.. of course some good and some bad. I have never been to a place where every dish was great.. Golden Buddha is no exception to this.. they do the basics well enough and have enough funky cool Asian style to keep me interested in returning. The carts around 1130 flow well but around noon it' s full blown freeway action! In fact there might be some road kill in there based on some of the looks on that last steam cart.. \n\nMe and 3 others who were feeling my pain ordered 14, count them, 14 different dishes. One of my friends is from Georgia and had never had dim sum but he is so courageous and unflinching that he was just a blast. Just the shot in the arm to get me out of my funk. I remember the first time I had dim sum.. my eyes wide open, nostrils flared and excited to see what was under the next steamer lid. That was him today.. one exciting thing after the next.. he was even willing to try chicken feet but this is one of those dishes not done very well here. \n\nMy friend took me back to a time where I was younger and less experienced. He looked up to me to guide him through the noodles, bao and sui mai.. like a big brother.. I'm privileged that I could show him something new and exciting and he was so into it! So instead of feeling sorry for myself I felt experienced and useful.. that there is something I can give back to others.. that its not all about me and me aging but about what can be shared with others.\n\nThere is so much more to do, give and feel in this short time we are here.. and Ill do it to, one bite at a time.","The best to be found in land locked Arizona.  My favorite sticky rice is here.  They have dim sum every day, but not a huge selection, though you can order off the menu.  I think it is much bigger on the weekends.  I'm just happy I can get my fix 7 days a week.  Beautiful gardens to walk through, with fish ponds, and a 99 market next door!","I ate at Golden Buddha a few weeks ago.  We ate at the restaurant after a day at the zoo with our 4 year old and had a blast.  The piano bar played tunes for my daughter and the staff was more than accommodating.  The general tso chicken was better than anything I can get in Tucson.  The soup was chocked full of fresh, read FRESH, not canned, vegetables.  All in all, I was very satisfied with the meal and the service.  Plus the decor is very nice, clean and cheery. \n\nEat at Golden Buddha.","For those who gave this place low marks, forgive me. I really like this place. Now I haven't tried various dim sum places so I'm reserving the right to downgrade the place as needed. The variety of food is plentiful, and the carts just keep on coming. I love the steamed pork buns, and the shiu mai (not sure if I spelled that correctly). Yesterday, my favorite pick was the deep fried rolls of taro and shrimp. YUM! I have never ordered from their menu so I can only talk about their dim sum. My friends and I try to go eat dim sum almost every Sunday. It's a cheap way to try new foods, and if you don't like it, well.. you can get away with pushing it aside with minimal guilt. Give it a try! You might be surprised.","I like Golden Buddha, have taken many friends there for Dim Sum.  \nTry not to \"hit\" the dumpling cart to heavy; otherwise cannot finish it to the dessert cart (LOL).\nLove the jasmine tea and the staff willing to help you if you do not understand the what each item is.\nSingapore Rice Noodles a favorite, along with any of the shrimp dumplings; also the broccoli and green beans.\nOnly wish that the carts with eggplant stuffed with shrimp or green peppers with shrimp were not on \"heated\" carts; by the time it gets to you the food is cold.\nOnly concern is that went on 22MAY2010 at 1:30PM; there was a closed sign due to electricity???\nREVISED: 26MAY2010 - called this evening - looks like they are back open again.","I've been to the Golden Buddha on several occasions and it is my favorite, by far, for honest Chinese food. \nWhile I've sampled everything from their vegetarian to their beef, I love their mandarin chicken. More recently, I was delighted to relive the wonders of their Kung Pao Chicken and Beef with Broccoli. \nI absolutely love the egg drop soup and mini crab rangoons that come with the meal.","The very first time I went to Golden Buddha was with my BFF and it was our first dim sum experience. Little did I know this would forever change my life and eating experiences. Although I must admit that first time was a bit awkward.\n\nGB wisely takes reservations which was wonderful (even though it wasn't crazy busy). Our assorted dim sum plates were flavorful and fresh. And the carts seemed to be in constant rotation so we were never too far from a good selection.\n\nWhat really helps GB is its location. The Cofco Center is an experience in itself, where one can have herbs specially blended, select a fresh member of marine life to take home and cook or browse through a store with one of the largest selections of Buddhas and hand fans I've experienced outside of San Francisco.","I've been to Golden Buddha a few times and have not been disappointed. \n\nThey have a LARGE selection of Dim Sum and if you're not careful you can get carried away.\n\nTry and get there early and you'll get the best and most fresh selection.\nMake sure you walk around the garden when you're done.","Probably the most comprehensive Chinese menu in the Valley.  Pick from well over 100 dishes, but if you want the best order the Peking Duck.  Everything else is very good, but without a wow factor.  You'll see lots of Chinese people in this massive restaurant, which probably means they're doing a fine job in the kitchen.","I very much enjoyed eating here. Food was great. Fairly fast service. Wasn't expensive either for the 4 of us.","Golden Buddha has GREAT dim sum.  Their prices are reasonable and the staff is very polite wheeling their little carts.  I tend to go on the weekend because there is more selection but they do dim sum throughout the week.  They also have some very authentic dishes on the menu for those who are more of the adventurous types.  Be sure to say hello to the turtles the next time you go.","This place in the Chinese Cultural Center has a very pretty and elegant bar area. I was pleased to learn that they had some very reasonable and delicious happy hour snacks. This is a good place for a Pina Colada. I had one by myself along with some dumplings and fried shrimp appetizer. Sadly I never brought anyone else here with me. It was happy hour heaven but you know? A lot of my friends in AZ pretty much hang out in one neighborhood or another and nobody I know really lives close to the Buddha.\nThe airport is pretty close by. This might be a good pre-flight send-off location.","I have had dim sum in New Orleans and Phoenix (not SF), and this is about equal to the best of New Orleans as far as flavor.\nAs for ambiance, today was a good day. I've had dim sum here about a dozen times, and have had very good service and quality 90% of the time, including weekends. I have had bad days here, but since today was good, I'll rate accordingly. It's closer to a 4.5, but since I can't give half-stars, I rounded up.\nDon't expect me to give these the right names, but... I was less than impressed with the bbq pork balls. They tasted too much like honey and the beef was minimal. The bbq sauce tasted bottled. Outside of that, their herbal hot tea is delicious even on a hot day.\nThe shu mai were very good, and the shrimp in a spinach dumpling was fantastic. A definite don't miss is their sticky rice in lotus leaf. It's among the best I've had anywhere. Just be careful; you'll find bones in it every once in a while. Go for any of their steamed dumplings; they're very flavorful. As others have said, I love the Chinese broccoli, but you'll only find it on the carts on weekends. Otherwise order it off the menu.\nToday (11:30 lunch) the carts came around often, and everything except the pork buns was piping hot and fresh. By the way, despite the price increases, even the sticky rice was considered a medium size entree, and the two of us eating there escaped with a bill under $20 and we were done in under 30 minutes.\nI strongly recommend the dim sum here, whether you've had it a million times or have never had it before. You usually won't be disappointed.","I don't really understand the poor reviews on this place.....maybe it depends on the day you go? We went on a Sunday, it was crazy busy, but service was great! (of course, my view of customer service is a little different then the rest... I used to live on an island where you were just happy to find what you were looking for, let alone expect good customer service) Anyways, our server was very sweet! Always had a smile on her face. The carts served us promplty and none of the food was cold. They always had whatever we wanted (I hate having to wait for the next cart).\n\nNow, as for the actual dim sum and food.......holy cow, to die for! So flavorful and fresh!! The broccoli makes you sing...and the wine noodles, make you cry. You leave with very weird mixed emotions, but mostly a happy belly full of yummy food.\n\nIn my opinion, this is the best dim sum I have been able to find in Phx. I'm ditching my previous spot (Mekong Palace) and will be back to Golden Buddha when the dim sum monster strikes again!"],"type":["Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low

waiter was to be found about ten minutes later they gave us our water and left again! It wasn't even busy! There were only TWO dim sum carts floating around somewhere. Then our waiter finally came around and took our orders of lunch entrees. The food was not even that good as the reviews that are posted on here. When we came up to pay, the bill was super overpriced. I will not be returning here, I am better off eating at Great Wall Cuisine.","If this place had zero stars I would have given them that ! Let me start off by saying I was so excited to read all great reviews so maybe I just came in on a off day? We walked in and were seated came over and asked if we wanted water or tea I guess they don't serve anything Else, Then we placed an order pork dumplings and sticky rice nasty! Then I asked if they served egg rolls they said they were out!!! they pushed their little carts around with hot plates that basically steam the food and is not fresh and what you get is soggy poor customer service we had to get up and look for someone to give us our tab so we could get the heck out of there are get some real food. It looked like it would be a great place for groups of people would not recommend if you are on mission for what you want and want to place an order but it could be a fun experience for some people.","You walk into a Chinese restaurant on a Saturday afternoon for dim sum and you expect the place to be PACKED.  Well, walking in to a pretty much empty dining room, it's a VERY CLEAR SIGN.  But my friend insisted and I was very hesitant for good reasons.  Another indicator, the majority of the patrons were NON Asian.  \n\nFood: You walk in and you see carts of the food by the entrance to the dining room.  Umm, I thought dim sum should come right off the steamer and into the carts and they roll it around, not sitting around.  The dim sum was garbage.  It had the typical selection, but at minimum.  \n\nService: It's ok.  But it doesn't make up for the horrible food.\n\nBottom line: NO WAY!  Stay away!","I've been here many times...Mother's Day with family, dim sum with book club, etc. But I will not go back again.  I stopped in to ask the owner about a donation or reduced price for a class of under-privileged kids that I volunteer with.  His reaction was to scoff and shoo me out the door while handing me his card and saying I could email him.  He turned his back and headed off to the messy newspaper-strewn table he haunts between guests arrivals.  Maybe he's a community-minded business owner, but then again, maybe he's not.  I'll be dining elsewhere.","Being from Chicago, we are used to getting authentic Chinese food all the time.  But when we first starting spending a lot of time in Scottsdale/Phoenix, we found it a challenge to get authentic Chinese food.  We were excited to find the Golden Buddha and have made many trips over the years all the way from the Troon North area to get our fix.  However, service has declined to the point where it is no longer worth the aggravation.  We went there last night for Chinese New Year and will never go back.  Granted they were very busy because of a lot of large tables there, but waiting almost an hour to get our food is not acceptable under any circumstance!  45 mins. into our wait, the waitress came back (after we flagged her down to ask about our food) and said one of the dishes we ordered was not available....after 45 mins.!!!! What makes the whole experience an unforgivable one is that the manager/owner is so indifferent and never apologized or offered a discount off the bill...nothing.  When we left, the same manager was at the piano singing in Chinese. Huh?  Other than Nee House in Scottsdale, the search goes on for a restaurant that serves authentic Chinese food closer to home.","I will NEVER go there again.  I reserved a table for a group of 16 people for 5:00 PM on Christmas Eve .  The person on the phone ( I believe the manager) repeatedly asked me to call ahead and give him an accurate head count since he said they'd be swamped that day.  I followed up with him twice.  \nWhen the first couple of us arrived, we had menus shoved in our faces immediately and told we \"Must order now.  Must order now\" because they were going to be busy later on.  The place was practically empty.  As each person arrived, they were treated the same way. \nWe rushed and placed our orders and then they brought out our checks WAY before we saw any sign of our food.  I have never in my life been treated so rudely by a restaurant.\nIt was utter chaos when the food started coming out while everyone struggled to get the correct dish they ordered.  One person didn't get her food until we were all just about finished eating. \nOne top of all that, the food wasn't even good.  I've had better Kung Pao Chicken at Panda Express!\nAfter being rushed through our meal, the place wasn't even half full by the time we left.  I thought being at the Cultural Center, this restaurant would be a sure thing but boy was I wrong.  Lovely way to spend Christmas Eve..","If you are looking a chinese restaurant to host a big party look some other than the Golden Buddah.  I recently attended a banquet at the Golden Buddah and I was shocked at the level of quality of food and service.  Of the 10 dishes served 4 were nearly inedible.  \n\nThere was a crab claw appetizer, most chinese restaurants prepare this dish by taking a crab claw surrounding it with ground shrimp, batter and then deep fry.  At Golden Buddah, the crab claw served was mostly batter.  \n\nThe shark fin soup served was mostly broth.  Shark fin is an expensive ingredient and most places usually use imitation shark fin, but come on at least put something in there so that I know I'm eating soup and not dirty sink water.  \n\nGinger scallion lobster is battered, fried, and then stir fried in a sauce with ginger and scallions.  The ginger scallion lobster served was over-cooked and dried out.  \n\nLastly, there was a steamed fish.  The fish was raw in the middle.   \n\nIt wasn't all bad, there was a crispy chicken with garlic dish that was pretty good, but out of 10 dishes 4 were bad, 5 were okay, and 1 was good.  \n\nDoes 4 bad dishes out of 10 warrant a one star rating?  Well it does when you factor in the service.  The soup, appetizer, and first entree arrived timely, but after that there was a 1 hour gap before we received the next dish.  The dishes were not served with accompanying white rice which I thought was odd.  We had to ask for it, and even the rice took a while to arrive.","I agree with Crystal C., that the dim sum isn't the greatest I've ever had. In fact, I am not sure if the meal was so tasty that it was memorable. I do remember the \"calamari\" was not really calamari, like you would think. It was presented more like a sweet and sour pork (so calamari with LOTS of breading) without any sauce. As a result, the dish was dry and salty.\n\nThe sticky rice was good (hard to mess up), the chicken feet were okay (needed more five spice powder), and the shumai was alright. The noodles were good, and I can see why the cart ran out after the first round. The diners were an equal mix of Asians and Americans. I would've preferred to see more Asians eating (as I am used to in a Chinatown and gives an indication of authenticity), but I do realize we're in Phoenix where the Asian population is not like San Francisco or Houston. \n\nThe meal came to about $30 for two, including jasmine tea. The carts are loud because they are made out of metal and roll on tile. I am also not used to staff members shouting what they have in their cart, like a newspaper boy yelling \"Extra! Extra!\" Christmas music was playing after mid-January, so the atmosphere felt strange. Next time I visit the city, I probably will pass.","Can't say that I was very impressed. Came for dinner in a hopeful and enthusiastic mood since the reviews have been pretty good, but I don't think this place lives up to its current good, but declining rating.\n\nOrdered the Combo fried rice (shrimp, chicken, beef, pork), sesame chicken, and garlic fried chicken. \n\nThe combo fried rice was pretty good, but ended up drinking about 6 glasses of water due to the MSG and sodium content. You'd think that the cook spent his better years in the French Foreign Legion in the Sahara eating salt tablets and developed a taste for them. \n\nThe sesame chicken had a good flavor and a thick brown sweet sauce. I liked it a lot until it got cool and the sauce looked (with that stringy consistency) more like glue. You think I'm kidding? I'm not.\n\nGarlic fried chicken was bad. Just bad. It was like an over roasted dried out half chicken with some dried garlic pieces sprinkled on top. No spices, no flavor, no good. \n\nWe then got all kinds of lip from the waitress when we asked if they could change the channel on the TV from college football, to the Suns game. They made it into this big deal that the \"customers\" wanted to see the football game. Yeah right, it was University of West Virginia Vs. University of Connecticut! I would have believed it if it was a local team....\n\nIt's better than a 1 star joint, but only because it's borderline edible. To be avoided.","This restaurant is located in the Chinese Cultural Center and was the one restaurant that I had not been to. So after some shopping at one of the shops, we stepped in to have dinner.\n\nWe stepped in and asked for a seat for two. We were seated immediately. The place was decorated nicely and a lady playing the piano made for great ambiance.\n\nWe looked at the menu briefly and ordered our drinks, an appetizer, a soup and two main dishes. The drinks came out promptly and so did the rest of the meal. My goodness everything we ordered was very tasty.\n\nThe waiter service itself however was not even close to the decor and food. He never introduced himself, and although he took our order, our food itself was brought out by a kitchen person.\n\nAfter we ordered our waiter really never came back asking if we needed anything else, except to give us our check at the end and that was after the person I was dining with got up and asked a different waiter for it.\n\nIt's amazing how a place with great food, decor, and ambiance can mess it all up by crappy waiter service.","I love Dim Sum, my favorite Chinese dish.\n\nWhen Golden Buddha first open, they have excellent Dim sum. I went there many times, I tell my friend how good it is, But now,  they change cook, taste more like  week old left over. Rumor has it, they change cook every few month, so Quality of cooking change. (not sure if that is true, but that is what I was told.)\nMy advice is; when you walk in the door and the place is pack, = Good Cook. if the place is bare = bad cook. leave immediately. don't waste your money.","If you just \"want\" dim sum, go here. If you are \"craving\" dim sum, go elsewhere (take a 5 hour drive west to neighboring state, California).\n\nAnyway, I've been visiting Golden Buddha in the noontime for roughly 2 years now. I believe they moved from their original site (7th St. & Osborn), formerly \"China Doll.\" Relocation brought along better atmosphere and smiling faces. This does not mean, better dim sum. But since we are in Phoenix, I will settle for what they have to offer. \n\nBe mindful of the dim sum tab. It's itemized high-medium-low. \n\nShaomai can be found as combinations of pork/mushroom, shrimp, or shark fin (which should not be confused as true shark bits, as the shaomai is prepared to look like a shark's fin). These picks are okay...perhaps on a better day shao mai will be served in less-rigid, or fresher wrappers. Potstickers are okay as well, just the usual scallion and pork, and dry wrapper. The baby pork ribs in light black bean sauce and jalapenos is alright, but sometimes lacks in taste. Tripe is also served in its bare minimum...so if you enjoy the texture and flavor of tripe, try this with its clear sauce and thinly sliced carrots and celery.  \nBuche (that's what I call it), or fried sesame balls are also available, although if you wait until dessert, they will also be a bit stiff. There are a few other things that may be \"spotted\" but are not worth mentioning. \n\nDon't order from their lunch menu, as you can find these over-salted dishes at Panda Express anyway. \n\nOverall, dim sum at Golden Buddha is a place to go if you are around the vicinity and feel like having something apart from the usual fast food. However, discriminating palates- beware.","Not impressed with this place at all. This was not the friendliest place around, maybe because of the language barrier (most or all were clearly native Chinese speakers), or maybe just the attitude of the employees.\n\nI ordered the sweet and sour chicken lunch, which came with the typical egg drop soup, crab rangoon, and egg roll. The soup was ok - maybe it's just me, but I prefer a real spoon to the scoop that they gave me. The egg roll was tiny and not that great, and the crab rangoon was ok, but maybe a little undercooked. The chicken wasn't bad, but nothing special, as was the rice and other stuff on the plate.\n\nOverall, this was just not my kind of Chinese place.","Disappointing.  Mediocre at best.  I am staying at the Aloft hotel in phoenix and ordered some delivery. I ordered a couple american chinese food staples: general tso's chicken, dumplings and hot&sour soup.  Soup had zero flavor, dumplings tasted freezer burned and processed.  General tso chicken was ehh. \n\nA lot of good reviews on here so it must be for eat in and for their dim sum.  Don't order delivery, you will be left hungry and unsatisfied.","Went there on Saturday for early lunch.  My wife did the dim sum, it was okay, we were both disgusted by the sugar cane shrimp; but the rest was good.  \n\nI ordered the chicken szechwuan, the waitress warned me it was \"spicy\" the reason I ordered it.  It came out delicious, but not what I would call spicy.  Overall its hard to find good Chinese in the valley and I would call this good without hesitation.","So I was referred to this place from the front desk of my hotel. I'm from SF so I'm coming from a place with really good chinese food. \n\nThe dim sum is just \"ok\" nothing for me to write home about. The one dish that I really liked was the chinese broccoli cooked with garlic sauce. Yum yum yum.  It's in a big bowl, not oily, not saucy, just really good. I think it's $7.50.  \n\nIt's a somewhat pricey and just like all chinese restaurants, it's not the cleanest.  The chair was filthy.  the dishes weren't all that great.  I wouldn't go back unless I want the chinese broccoli.  \n\nSo I went on a Sunday and it was not crowded at all. There's not a huge asian population  in Phoenix (not that I could tell) so I don't think there's a high demand for dim sum.  And also, I sooooooo felt like taking a pic of this, but a Mexican lady was pushing one of the dim sum carts. That is unheard of in SF.  This is a mainly mandarin restaurant and the dim sum places I go are usually cantonese.  Not a big deal though since the dishes look the same. \n\nDude, there was a turtle in the fish tank that I saw as I left.  I hope they don't eat that!","A Premier Chinese Atmosphere,\nThe Chinese cultural center and Asian Garden produces an Asain atmosphere that can be recognized from the 202.  \n With Dim Sum served this location earns its respect from the local community.\n\nDim Sum tip,  You have to be smart with the Dim Sum ladies they look nice innocent but they are professional sales people that will sell you more dishes than you need before you know what to do.  \n\nI love the desserts here ask the server to see the dessert tray.","This restaurant has a bit of an identity crisis. It is in the Chinese cultural center, but serves Japanese beer (Kirin on tap!) and the live piano music is American pop. We had to ask for chopsticks.\n\nHaving said that, the service was professional. Our waiter held a hot appetizer for one of our party who was away from the table so that it would not be cold when he returned. We were asked frequently--and not too frequently--if things were ok both by our waiter and the manager/proprietor.\n\nThe food was ok-to-good. Fried shrimp egg rolls were dainty but yummy. Duck was tasty but very chewy. Kung-pao chicken was pleasantly spiced. Plenty of rice. A pitcher of ice water with lemon was left at the table. \n\nAtmosphere was also pleasant. Chairs comfortable, tables spaced well, restrooms large and clean...and there is indeed a large golden Buddha by the entrance.","I took a group of friends here and relatives other times. The place is consistently good for Dim-sum during lunch. It is typical Chinese and nothing fancy.\n\nWhat helps this place is the moat scenery.  3 stars for visiting here based on convenience since there are similar places in town.","Having grown up in Hong Kong and having eaten dim sum in London, NY, LA, SF and Vancouver (actually Richmond), I can confidently say I know my dim sum.\n\nGood selection of well-executed dim sum when the carts actually come around and there's anything left in it.  I'd give it 4 stars for food but the wait definitely detracted from the whole experience.\n\nI think the problem with Golden Buddha is that they can't handle the heavy flow on weekends.  There's not enough regular dim sum eaters like LA that can sustain a steady flow of diners throughout the week, forcing restaurants like Golden Buddha to depend heavily on extra part-time help on weekends.  \n\nDim sum takes serious skill so the chef still ends up doing most of the work.  When we looked into the kitchen, we saw a Chinese woman doing most of the cooking herself.  No wonder it took forever for a cart to come out and when it does, it's swarmed on by a pack of vultures.\n\nIf you're willing to eat at a more simply decorated place with a smaller menu, I'd highly recommend China Chan.  It's much more relaxed - usually no wait on weekends.  An experienced chef makes all the dim sum himself so the menu's much shorter but all the classics are on it.  Anything steamed is made to order so is very fresh.","Situated in the Chinese Cultural Center near the SkyHarbor Airport, this was another pleasant find. All I had was the Dim Sum menu, and I would say this is the best you're gonna get in Phoenix. Still worth the stop to get your Dim Sum fix. The cart ladies were pleasant and very happy to converse with me in Cantonese. Only downside was the chicken sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaves, naw mei gai, was way overcooked, and mushy.","Do you want to eat Chinese Food in an elegant environment on a Friday night in Phoenix? \n\nBe entertained by classic, quiet standards being played live on a piano while you dine?\n\nAre you 50 years old and Caucasian?\n\nThen the Golden Buddha is the place for you! \n\nIts in the Chinese Cultural Center Mall on 44th, and a popular weekend spot for Dim Sum. For a DIm Sum starved Valley of the Sun, Golden Buddha's is decent. \n\nFor dinner, though, it is awfully Americanized and not very authentic Chinese. But with a bunch of American customers coming for dinner, what do you expect? They probably think they are getting \"real Chinese\" food by going to the Chinese Mall, but then again, they are used to PF Chang's or Stix normally in their neighborhood, so this is a step up.\n\nThe best thing about this place is the decor, which is clean and nice, with a Hong Kong Junk boat design covering the ceiling from the bar into the dining room. The next best thing is the Piano interludes on weekend nights. The service is next, which is a little overly eager to remove your plate, and the last thing is the food. \n\nThey do give decent portions. I ordered Guo Teh (potstickers) and got 6 fat ones. But they weren't served with the usual soy, chili oil and vinegar, but a soy and green onions mixture. The Mapo Tofu was ok, as they used a nice silky tofu, which was nice, but no green onions, and sliced black mushrooms instead, which I like, but not in this dish.\n\nCome here for the ambiance and music in the evenings, or on the weekend days for Dim Sum.","Decent dim sum, especially to be found in the middle of the desert. Sadly, the best food I've had in Phoenix.","This place is a little difficult for me to review.  I was staying at the Hampton Inn across the street and this is the closest restaurant so off I went.\n\nI walked in and the owner or manager met me at the door and asked \"how many\"?\n\nI told him I wanted to order take out and handed me a menu and pointed to the waiting area which was covered in newspapers.  I chose to go to the bar, order a glass of wine, and peruse the menu.\n\nThe drinks are expensive but I didn't think the food was.  Less than $10 for my Mongolian Chicken which came with white sticky rice and a fortune cookie.  When ordering I asked if I could have fried rice instead of white rice but was told \"no\".  Most places allow this for a nominal fee.\n\nFine by me.  Give the white rice.  Food was prepared and their to-go boxes were a lot better than the standard white Chinese \"to go\" boxes.  They also included the plastic-ware, napkin, and soy sauce, which a lot of places forget.\n\nLooking around I found a whole lot of goodness along with a couple disappointments.  Most notably the newspaper strewn about and behind the bar, to the right were a lot of boxes stacked in an unsightly fashion.  I could have been a little more presentable in my opinion.\n\nI peeked into the dining room because I wanted to see if the piano music was piped in or live.  It was live which was very nice. Also, the dinning room looked very nice and cozy.\n\nAs I was leaving the same man who greeted me upon entering made sure to wish me a good evening.  My initial impression of the man was that he was surly and testy but that's just how he comes off.\n\nThe food was very good.  The Mongolian sauce was mixture of sweet with spice and the chicken and vegetables all tasted fresh.","My husband and I went there Saturday, the service was great!  Our friends were going to be late so they told us to start.  And start we did!\nThey were serving Dim Sum, something we had never tried, so glad we did, it was wonderful, hubby wouldn't do the chicken feet, but I think next time I will, it looked very good.\nOur friends showed up and ordered their food, and ate all of it, they said that usually they take food home, but it was so good they had to eat all of it!\nWe will be going back very soon!","Let's see, over 50... check \nold white man...........check \neats dinner ...............check \nlistens to the piano  check \n\nwow this must be the place for me, I mean after all it is in a Chinese mall, no make that a Chinese Cultural Center. How could I possibly have discerning taste with such trickery to get me here to eat. \nDude if you are going to rate a restaurant no need to degrade others with your arrogance. \nFool is my review of wanugee N. \n\nNow on the restaurant. The last time we were here the food was not good, the piano was too loud and the waitress had a real attitude. IT won't keep me from going back as I have had good meals and wait service too. \n\nBack to wanugee N. I do not expect any place in Phx. to have authentic Chinese food, by that I mean the street food one finds in China. \nBut I do expect what I fork in to my mouth is worth what I am going to fork over in cost. Even an old white guy like me can tell the difference between good and bad food. No matter what it is called.","Okay so Ive been glum the past few days as I have an impending birthday. Every year this time I get all down in the dumps.. not that I'm not happy with my life cause life is good. Its more like getting further away from my youth and closer to being well, old. All of my grandparents were crotchety, sourpuss drama queens.. is that my fate? Can I break the mold or am I to going to be a crotchety sourpuss?\n\nSo as I contemplate and figure out what I'm going to do with my birthday baggage I decide to squash it with food. All weekend Ive been eating out and having a good time. This is one of the few times outside of a vacation where I will live it completely and to the near of sheer gluttony. So why not dim sum? \n\nIve chowed much dim sum in my 36 years of earthen wear.. of course some good and some bad. I have never been to a place where every dish was great.. Golden Buddha is no exception to this.. they do the basics well enough and have enough funky cool Asian style to keep me interested in returning. The carts around 1130 flow well but around noon it' s full blown freeway action! In fact there might be some road kill in there based on some of the looks on that last steam cart.. \n\nMe and 3 others who were feeling my pain ordered 14, count them, 14 different dishes. One of my friends is from Georgia and had never had dim sum but he is so courageous and unflinching that he was just a blast. Just the shot in the arm to get me out of my funk. I remember the first time I had dim sum.. my eyes wide open, nostrils flared and excited to see what was under the next steamer lid. That was him today.. one exciting thing after the next.. he was even willing to try chicken feet but this is one of those dishes not done very well here. \n\nMy friend took me back to a time where I was younger and less experienced. He looked up to me to guide him through the noodles, bao and sui mai.. like a big brother.. I'm privileged that I could show him something new and exciting and he was so into it! So instead of feeling sorry for myself I felt experienced and useful.. that there is something I can give back to others.. that its not all about me and me aging but about what can be shared with others.\n\nThere is so much more to do, give and feel in this short time we are here.. and Ill do it to, one bite at a time.","The best to be found in land locked Arizona.  My favorite sticky rice is here.  They have dim sum every day, but not a huge selection, though you can order off the menu.  I think it is much bigger on the weekends.  I'm just happy I can get my fix 7 days a week.  Beautiful gardens to walk through, with fish ponds, and a 99 market next door!","I ate at Golden Buddha a few weeks ago.  We ate at the restaurant after a day at the zoo with our 4 year old and had a blast.  The piano bar played tunes for my daughter and the staff was more than accommodating.  The general tso chicken was better than anything I can get in Tucson.  The soup was chocked full of fresh, read FRESH, not canned, vegetables.  All in all, I was very satisfied with the meal and the service.  Plus the decor is very nice, clean and cheery. \n\nEat at Golden Buddha.","For those who gave this place low marks, forgive me. I really like this place. Now I haven't tried various dim sum places so I'm reserving the right to downgrade the place as needed. The variety of food is plentiful, and the carts just keep on coming. I love the steamed pork buns, and the shiu mai (not sure if I spelled that correctly). Yesterday, my favorite pick was the deep fried rolls of taro and shrimp. YUM! I have never ordered from their menu so I can only talk about their dim sum. My friends and I try to go eat dim sum almost every Sunday. It's a cheap way to try new foods, and if you don't like it, well.. you can get away with pushing it aside with minimal guilt. Give it a try! You might be surprised.","I like Golden Buddha, have taken many friends there for Dim Sum.  \nTry not to \"hit\" the dumpling cart to heavy; otherwise cannot finish it to the dessert cart (LOL).\nLove the jasmine tea and the staff willing to help you if you do not understand the what each item is.\nSingapore Rice Noodles a favorite, along with any of the shrimp dumplings; also the broccoli and green beans.\nOnly wish that the carts with eggplant stuffed with shrimp or green peppers with shrimp were not on \"heated\" carts; by the time it gets to you the food is cold.\nOnly concern is that went on 22MAY2010 at 1:30PM; there was a closed sign due to electricity???\nREVISED: 26MAY2010 - called this evening - looks like they are back open again.","I've been to the Golden Buddha on several occasions and it is my favorite, by far, for honest Chinese food. \nWhile I've sampled everything from their vegetarian to their beef, I love their mandarin chicken. More recently, I was delighted to relive the wonders of their Kung Pao Chicken and Beef with Broccoli. \nI absolutely love the egg drop soup and mini crab rangoons that come with the meal.","The very first time I went to Golden Buddha was with my BFF and it was our first dim sum experience. Little did I know this would forever change my life and eating experiences. Although I must admit that first time was a bit awkward.\n\nGB wisely takes reservations which was wonderful (even though it wasn't crazy busy). Our assorted dim sum plates were flavorful and fresh. And the carts seemed to be in constant rotation so we were never too far from a good selection.\n\nWhat really helps GB is its location. The Cofco Center is an experience in itself, where one can have herbs specially blended, select a fresh member of marine life to take home and cook or browse through a store with one of the largest selections of Buddhas and hand fans I've experienced outside of San Francisco.","I've been to Golden Buddha a few times and have not been disappointed. \n\nThey have a LARGE selection of Dim Sum and if you're not careful you can get carried away.\n\nTry and get there early and you'll get the best and most fresh selection.\nMake sure you walk around the garden when you're done.","Probably the most comprehensive Chinese menu in the Valley.  Pick from well over 100 dishes, but if you want the best order the Peking Duck.  Everything else is very good, but without a wow factor.  You'll see lots of Chinese people in this massive restaurant, which probably means they're doing a fine job in the kitchen.","I very much enjoyed eating here. Food was great. Fairly fast service. Wasn't expensive either for the 4 of us.","Golden Buddha has GREAT dim sum.  Their prices are reasonable and the staff is very polite wheeling their little carts.  I tend to go on the weekend because there is more selection but they do dim sum throughout the week.  They also have some very authentic dishes on the menu for those who are more of the adventurous types.  Be sure to say hello to the turtles the next time you go.","This place in the Chinese Cultural Center has a very pretty and elegant bar area. I was pleased to learn that they had some very reasonable and delicious happy hour snacks. This is a good place for a Pina Colada. I had one by myself along with some dumplings and fried shrimp appetizer. Sadly I never brought anyone else here with me. It was happy hour heaven but you know? A lot of my friends in AZ pretty much hang out in one neighborhood or another and nobody I know really lives close to the Buddha.\nThe airport is pretty close by. This might be a good pre-flight send-off location.","I have had dim sum in New Orleans and Phoenix (not SF), and this is about equal to the best of New Orleans as far as flavor.\nAs for ambiance, today was a good day. I've had dim sum here about a dozen times, and have had very good service and quality 90% of the time, including weekends. I have had bad days here, but since today was good, I'll rate accordingly. It's closer to a 4.5, but since I can't give half-stars, I rounded up.\nDon't expect me to give these the right names, but... I was less than impressed with the bbq pork balls. They tasted too much like honey and the beef was minimal. The bbq sauce tasted bottled. Outside of that, their herbal hot tea is delicious even on a hot day.\nThe shu mai were very good, and the shrimp in a spinach dumpling was fantastic. A definite don't miss is their sticky rice in lotus leaf. It's among the best I've had anywhere. Just be careful; you'll find bones in it every once in a while. Go for any of their steamed dumplings; they're very flavorful. As others have said, I love the Chinese broccoli, but you'll only find it on the carts on weekends. Otherwise order it off the menu.\nToday (11:30 lunch) the carts came around often, and everything except the pork buns was piping hot and fresh. By the way, despite the price increases, even the sticky rice was considered a medium size entree, and the two of us eating there escaped with a bill under $20 and we were done in under 30 minutes.\nI strongly recommend the dim sum here, whether you've had it a million times or have never had it before. You usually won't be disappointed.","I don't really understand the poor reviews on this place.....maybe it depends on the day you go? We went on a Sunday, it was crazy busy, but service was great! (of course, my view of customer service is a little different then the rest... I used to live on an island where you were just happy to find what you were looking for, let alone expect good customer service) Anyways, our server was very sweet! Always had a smile on her face. The carts served us promplty and none of the food was cold. They always had whatever we wanted (I hate having to wait for the next cart).\n\nNow, as for the actual dim sum and food.......holy cow, to die for! So flavorful and fresh!! The broccoli makes you sing...and the wine noodles, make you cry. You leave with very weird mixed emotions, but mostly a happy belly full of yummy food.\n\nIn my opinion, this is the best dim sum I have been able to find in Phx. I'm ditching my previous spot (Mekong Palace) and will be back to Golden Buddha when the dim sum monster strikes again!"],"type":["Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low

I had a horrible experience.  Vowed never to go back!  At that time, I even had a terrible interaction with the owner.\n\nThis time I was invited with a couple of girlfriends because they love it. Decided to try again since it was more about the \"get together\" than the food/location.\n\nThis time, overpriced food and bad service.  Overall, it was not anything out of the ordinary and not worth the price.   I had the veal speciality.   Large portion, but ok.  Staff was not very attentive for the small amount of customers present.\n\nI am a Pittsburgh native.  This is a bad neighborhood. \n\nI am NOT interested in ever going back!","No better in taste than a Fazoli or even an Olive Garden.  Inflated prices, like the cheapest entree was $40, try to disguise this place as something it is not.  Went with a group of co workers, so we pretty much got everything on the menu and not one thing stuck out really good.  Service is incredibly slow.  Not worth it at all.  Even if you tell yourself that atleast the portions are large, the food is just not good enough to warrant wasting a meal eating there.","The menu online gives no prices, and the entrees are ridiculously overpriced for what you get - a good meal, but far too much food, and nothing extraordinary. The entrees are $50 - $60. BE WARNED - if you want atmosphere to go with your $60 entree, you'd better REQUEST DOWNSTAIRS! Otherwise you can have your anniversary dinner in a small room in front of large televisions. Who knew? And the staff will definitely not accommodate your request for a more romantic spot - even if they know it is your tenth anniversary! Wow. Should have walked out.","I do not say this with many 2 star ratings but I would like to go back for another try.  The reason is simple, in reading the reviews below, I have to assume we hit Alla Famigilia on a bad night, at least I hope so.  The main reason for the low rating was the service.  We were seated on the third floor which is their bar area, at a high top table and the bar tender was our server.  She had to mix drinks for every table on the third floor, tend to the patrons at the bar and come around to wait on our table.  That was not fair to her and definitely not fair to us.  Her service and attentiveness lacked for obvious reasons but even when she was \"free\" she walked by our table without a glance and was apparently hard of hearing.  Furthermore, when ever one person got her attention for another drink or something, she said okay and left, without giving anyone else a chance to order.  The rest of the staff tried to pick up the slack a little but they were jammed as well.  Sounds weird, but I never felt so rushed in a 3 hour dinner.  The food took awhile, which is fine and expected on a busy Saturday night, just keep the drinks flowing and stop by once in a awhile so we don't notice.\n\nI also did not like that we were seated at a high top table.  I love the high tops for drinks and a few apps but for a 3 hour meal, these were uncomfortable, especially if your legs didn't hit the chair cross bars correctly (either too short or too tall).\n\nThe food was good, very good in some instances and disappointing in one.  I loved the pasta with Vodka sauce and the salad, both part of the entree which is unusual for a high end restaurant.  The meatball appetizer and the calamari and shrimp appetizer were the best things I ate all evening.  The biggest disappointment was the veal chop.  I love a good bone in veal chop but was leaning towards a seafood dish. I ended up changing my mind right before I ordered as I saw the veal chop brought out to another table and it looked amazing.  The disappointment was it was over-cooked.  It came out medium well at best (closer to well) and for $68, and for the amount they were serving that night, they should know how to cook them to perfection.  Not a spot of pink to be found.  No one even asked us during our meal if everything was okay or any issues.  When most of the chop remained on my plate and everyone else's entree was 90% eaten, not even a \"was everything okay\".  Just clear me out and get on with the next one.\n\nI hope to have the opportunity to go back and I will not be seated in the third floor bar area and I will not get my same waitress and give it another try.  I expected so much more.","We had the mushrooms, meatball appetizer, pasta, salad, veal piccata and spaghetti with clam sauce. A nice pasta dish with roasted veggies and marinara was made as a special order. But I was not wowed by this restaurant. Large portions are not enough to impress me. The tastes were good, but for the prices, I'd expect better. If you're a big meat eater, or love to eat huge amounts of pasta, ok, this is great. But the sauces were just ok, nothing spectacular. Spaghetti with clams was covered with red pepper flakes but not noted as such on the menu. Would you like someone to cover your pizza slice with red pepper flakes without asking? I'm sure the deserts are good but we didn't have any - but the sizes of the appetizers and entrees is just over the top, but not worth the premium prices to me.","The food was delicious. But it is a ridiculously expensive restaurant. If you're intimidated by spending $100 or more on a complete meal for 1 person, then this is not the place for you. Knowing that we had other plans for our evening, my date and I cut the meal short with appetizers, salad, and a bottle of one of the lesser expensive wines they offer, which was $54 a bottle. Our check was still $120, and we left hungry. Which is a shame, because the little of what we did have, we fully enjoyed. There are plenty of Italian restaurants in Pittsburgh, and many of them are very, very good - where one can enjoy a meal for a fraction of what it costs here.","This used to be my secret place, but I've told so many people about it that I have a hard time getting a reservation.  I've known Jonathan (chef/owner) for a few years and he's done some good improvements.  He's added a bar upstairs which is very cool and they also have a patio that's great.  I had a dinner party there in the summer and have another one planned in March and Jonathan totally goes the extra effort to make it special.  He arranged for a dj last time, so we were able to dance off some of his food.  Okay, the food is great.  I especially recommend the Veal Chop.  The staff is awesome. I really like Marney and Errol (two main servers) and I like Jordan the bartender upstairs (Marney's daughter).  I'd like to give this place 5 stars, but it has a few smaller problems.  It's a little bit pricey.  The good is that the cost does include salad, pasta, and bread, but the bad is that you'll easily spend $50 on an entree.  The Veal Chop is $65.  That's a little much, especially considering the location.  The dishes also which are delicious are simply toooooo big.  I mean literally you can three meals out of one entree,  I would suggest some smaller plates especially for the bar.  One last tip, even though it's not BYOB anymore, you can still BYOB.  He won't turn you away.  This is one of my favorite restaurants.  The chef is really talented and I'd hazard a guess that if he was in New York he could be a celebrity chef if he wanted.  He's got the personality.","The food is unforgettable, but unfortunately so is the bill.  Sicilian themed with fresh ingredients in an intimate setting all prepared in an open kitchen.\n\nAsk before you order a special, or you might be stunned when you are handed the check. But if you love food and money is no object, this is your place. A great place for Valentine's day or a special anniversary splurge, with the emphasis on the word 'splurge'.","Old school Italian. Enough said. This place sets the standard for great Italian food.\nThe meatballs are a muct have and the pastas are incredible.\nI had a veal chop with long hots. It just doesn't get any better.\nAnd don't miss the tiramisu. As good as it gets.","First, the Veal Milanese is easily the best veal chop I've had anywhere. Ever. And I've had plenty of veal.  Second, the veal chop is definitely in my top 5 favorite dishes I've ever had, ever. \n\nFantastic restaurant. The relatively new chef has made this place even better than it was. This is THE most underrated restaurant on Yelp in Pittsburgh. Great service, extremely friendly staff, fantastic atmosphere.\n\nBe sure to come hungry. You cannot leave unsatisfied. Meals typically last me 3-4 hours, but I take my time. BYOB is a bonus too. \n\nIn summary, Alla Famiglia is consistently the best restaurant in Pittsburgh. Try it if you have not, and you won't be disappointed.","I have been frequenting Alla Famiglia since 2007 and it is still my favorite Italian restaurant in Pittsburgh and perhaps my favorite in the world!  \n\nChef Jonathan is a genius - his \"Veal Chop Milanese\" with lump crab, toasted pine nuts, and lemon is the BEST I've ever had.  Every time we eat here, my husband orders this dish and refuses to try anything else - that's how AMAZING it is.  \n\nI have tried a variety of entrees - everything from the the Veal Chop Pizzaiolo to the Steak il pizzaiolo to the Medallions of veal Pomodoro ai Pepperoni.  Each dish is infused with deliciousness that makes these entrees OUT OF THIS WORLD!  \n\nYou have got to try the following:  mozzarella (apptz), hot peppers (apptz), mozzarella stuffed meatball (apptz), vodka pasta (automatically received with your meal - sauce is delicious), veal chop milanese (entr\u00e9e).  \n\nYou won't be disappointed - the kitchen is open so you can even watch as Chef Jonathan prepares your dinner.  \n\nMake a reservation.  Neighborhood is a bit sketchy so be careful.  \n\nPS.  I've taken all my friends, family, and business partners (many who do not live in Pittsburgh) here and everyone absolutely loves it and wishes they lived in Pitt so they could come here more often.  In fact, we no longer live in Pittsburgh, but every time we come into town for a visit, we HAVE to eat dinner at our favorite Alla Famiglia!","This is my second review of Alla Famalgia and again this place gets five stars. I loved every part of my meal. I started out with the twelve ounce stuffed meatball and the truffled mushroom appetizers. The waiter invited me to watch as the mushrooms were being prepared at the kitchen counter. There I chatted with the chef as he prepared my app. Explaining as he went on, first slicing fresh chantrel, portobellos, and button mushrooms. Next he saut\u00e9 them in olive oil, added brown sugar, brandy, raisins, and finished it with heavy cream. They were fantastic. There were a variety of specials including wild boar chops, a risotto with prawns, scallops, and black truffles. But I chose the dry aged filet with lump crab in a leek cream. It was the best piece of filet I've ever had. It was easily a pound of beef and a half pound of crab in a light cream sauce with leeks. I could barely touch it after the pasta, salad, bread, and appetizers. I brought my leftovers home and have them another time. Dessert consisted of a nice portion of carrot cake with an apricot cream cheese icing with apricot jam filling. It was a nice take on an old favorite. For the four of us the bill was over 300 dollars, but well worth it for the attentive service and extremely well prepared food.","Spent the weekend in the city with some friends. This was our first time to Alla Famiglia.  Unbelievable!!!  We enjoyed everything.  If you are looking for high quality food with a great friendly staff, this is it.  It is a little out of the way but it is worth the trip.  If I had the option to give 6 stars I would do it.   Very impressive.","While visiting the Pittsburgh area, my wife and I were intrigued by the excellent reviews we found of Alla Familgia.  While it was a bit of a drive from Cranberry Township, we needed a dining reprieve after a disappointing visit at BRAVO! Cucina Italiana.  East Warrington Avenue is undergoing major construction which made finding parking a bit difficult, fortunately there is valet service in a lot to the side of the restaurant which we took advantage of.  \nUpon entering, we were warmly welcomed by the host.  We visited on a stormy evening and were fortunate to find that some reservations had been cancelled due to the weather, which enabled us to get a table.  I strongly advise to get reservations in advance.  We were seated on the first floor with a view of the chefs cooking.  Awesome.\nAll that has been said in prior reviews, I heartily agree with.  The bread, cheese, and dipping oil was a delicious start.  Ingredients were fresh.  The pasta and main course dishes were done perfectly.  My wife had the Gorgonzola Filet Mignon, which she described as one of the best meals she has ever eaten.\nWhen we are in the area, we'll be back.","I was in Pittsburgh (my hometown) for a visit from Boston.  I was so pleased with the meal at this restaurant.  It was by far the best restaurant I have ever been to in the Burgh.  The wait staff, chef, food, was stellar.  We are known for very good restaurants in Boston and this restaurant could be in Boston or NYC it is that fantastic!  I would highly recommend going here if you have a special occasion, date night, or just want a superb meal.","FACT: Thee best Italian meal I've had in the Burgh, hands down!\nFACT: I ate so much I thought they would have to wheel me out on a stretcher.\nFACT: It's a serious hidden gem in a slightly sketchy neighborhood.\n\nNeed some more info, because I'm comin' atcha with the goods! To start they set the table with \"Holy Oil,\" which is banana pepper olive oil for dipping Italian bread in, a seasoned cecci bean and cheese gustoso and a goat cheese and olive spread. I wish they sold that banana pepper olive oil because I wanted to have it every day of my life! \n\nWe ordered the famous Meatball appetizer. This meatball is for serious! It's massive and stuffed with mozzarella cheese. Yep, I'm for realz. It was just oozing Italian sexiness, in a ball. As soon as I tasted the red sauce, it tasted like my Grandma's, which sparked fond memories and made me want to actually live in this place. \n\nWe also ordered the Trifolata, which is assorted mushrooms and currants in marsala cream. It was also incredible. The bad/good of it was that it wasn't really needed because they give you so much food, but it was delicious, so whatever!\n\nFor the Third course they serve you your choice of pasta either with their famous home made vodka sauce or fettucini. But here's the thing, the fettucini is made in front of you... in a cheese wheel. Yep, I'm for realz again! I know I'm crazy for not ordering it, but I really love me some vodka sauce and was incredibly happy with this amazing homemade sauce. My hubby got the fetticini and loved it. See, we're all happy here!\n\nFourth course is a salad with red vinagariette, roasted red peppers, candied walnuts, golden raisens and gargonzola cheese. It wasn't memorable amongst all the bangin' dishes but not too shabby at all.\n\nFor the Fifth course (and when I finally tapped out) I ordered the Cioppino with shrimp, mussels, clams, scallops and fish in a saffron and tomato broth with sambuca. It matched all the other dishes. Just incredible. Loved the broth, loved the succulent scallop (just one, but I can't complain, I was stuffed by that point!), the shrimp was jumbo and the fish was perfectly cooked. And the garlic bread was excellent.\n\nWhenever anyone says things are expensive, I usually think they're talking $30 a plate. But, this place is legit expensive. Think $50 (ish) a plate. But what I can tell you is it was 100% worth it! We had leftovers for two days! Talk about an Italian hospitality. Which, by the way, the service was exceptional, but I would have expected that here. \n\nA perfect special night out, if you don't mind unbuckling a couple notches in front of your dining companion, of course!","Absolutely incredible restaurant! It is by far my favorite restaurant in the city. Everything about this place is fantastic especially their Veal Chop Milanese, the restaurant is pretty pricey but 100% well worth the money. I recommend this restaurant to anyone who is looking for a fantastic Italian meal.","This is my favorite place to eat!  The greens and beans, the meatball, and the hot cheese for appetizers are excellent.  I love the pasta with a dash of the oil they give you. The Alfredo in the cheese wheel is an excellent alternative to red sauce.   I've tried just about every dish there and never had a bad meal.  The Veal Chop is by far my favorite.  Huge portions which usually come home!! ;)\nThe atmosphere is a very quaint three story house, use valet parking, because the area is not the best! Lol but the police station is a cross the street. So it's all good!   \nThis is the perfect place for a great meal with great service for any function or just date night!","Possibly the best Italian Restaurant I've ever been too.  The Vodka Sauce was phenomenal.  I finished the evening with a  Fernet Branca.....perfection.","This is one of if not the best meals I have ever had.   I have only gone as part of work functions (about 3 different occasions) and every time we get the upstairs private room.  The service is fantastic.  I always have the Veal Chop Milanese which is AMAZING.  They also have a delicious pasta as an appetizer which has a little spice to it.  You will not find a better meal in Pittsburgh.  I have no idea what the prices actually are as I have never paid but it is definitely very pricey.  The neighborhood is real grimey but don't let that dissuade you from going there.","Their prices are exorbitant but so worth it. I've only had Italian this good in NY, LA, and Italy. No wonder there are pictures of celebrities all over the walls. What a hidden gem. $260 for two? Money well spent.","UPDATED: Just wanted to share that we attempted to visit for a third time when my husband's brother was in town in mid-November of 2014.  We had reservations for 7:30 on a Tuesday, so we obviously figured we would be seated immediately.  The brother and his girlfriend arrived a couple minutes before the reservation and were told to go up to the bar while they set the table and wait for the rest of the party.  I arrived about a minute after and my husband a few minutes behind me as he needed to park due to the lack of valet during the week.  There was no one at the host stand when either of us came in.  So we went up to the bar, declined a drink... and waited, and waited.  The bartender soon became deeply involved in picking a wine for a couple at the bar, not his fault.  The brother eventually was able to flag down a waitress to ask if she could check on our table.  She looked very annoyed.  She eventually went over to the phone at the bar, called down, hung up the phone and said, dead pan, \"no, it's not ready yet.\"  Not a smile, not a sorry, not a \"can we get you a drink on the house?\" Meanwhile, there was an open table for 4 on that floor.  The bartender eventually told us \"that's for a reservation.\" \"Yes, we have a reservation... for 25 minutes ago.\"  \"They must have specifically requested that table.\"  They did, however, offer us the table right next to the door on the first floor though - the one with the 10 degree breeze coming in that night.  No thank you.  We were very insulted by the lack of table for our reservation, but more so by the lack of acceptable service.  We decided to leave and spend $20 on pizza instead of $100+ per person and enjoyed much better service.. which is never the way it should be.  Hopefully they solve this problem soon.  We'll give it one more go when the insult has worn off.\n\nMy husband won't hesitate to tell you what his favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh is: Alla Famiglia.  And to be honest, these days I agree with him!  \n\nWhile my husband enjoys many of the more \"up and coming\" restaurants with smaller portions and interesting flavor combinations, he often finds himself longing for the same quality food with better cuts of meat and bigger portions.  This is where we satisfy both of our appetites for big flavor and, well, big portions.  But to reduce Alla Famiglia to those two things alone would not do it justice.\n\nLet's start out instead with addressing the two biggest critiques of this place: its location and the price.  Yes, it is in Allentown, but they also have plenty of parking and valet if you prefer.  Honestly, we drive almost everywhere to get dinner, so this is not an issue for us.  The other thing I always hear about is how expensive it is.  Some of those complaints come from people who I know have no problem giving their money to the big steakhouse chains, while getting a lot less value.  No, it is not cheap.  You will likely pay upwards of $50 for your entry.  The veal chops are close to $70.  But, that's not all you get.  You get delicious, fresh baked bread, a spread, dipping oil and gustoso for same, a delicious salad, and homemade pasta served family style.  If you wanted to be especially frugal, you could approach this place like an Olive Garden senior special: feast on the freebies and take your entree to go.  But, even if you're full, it may be too difficult not to savor the meal as it comes out...\n\nI've been here twice and my husband has been here three times (lucky - he got to go for work and he said they ordered almost every appetizer, all of which were apparently delicious).  The first time I ordered the filet with gorgonzola.  It was one of the most delicious and largest filets I've ever had.  My husband ordered a veal chop with prosciutto which I don't think I recognized on the current menu, but he absolutely loved it.  The veal chop is one of the largest bone-in cuts of meat I've seen and the sear on it was absolutely perfect.  We also ordered the mussels, which were spicy and delicious, and the meatball appetizer, which I remember being tasty, but nothing too out of the ordinary.  I think there are other things on the menu to try first. \n\nThe second time we came I ordered the Milanese veal chop, breaded, slightly citrusy, and absolutely heavenly.    He had the cowboy ribeye which was also large and an absolutely beautiful cut of meat.  The husband has a thing about fatty cuts and avoiding anything that is the least bit chewy, and he barely had to leave a piece on his plate.  We also got the calamari appetizer, which was perfectly, lightly fried with a savory, garlic sauce that sets it apart from the sweet sauces often served with calamari.\n\nFinally, I should note that the service we have received here has always been exceptional.  Everyone is always professional and courteous.","After a friend told me about her wonderful experience here, I knew I had to go. I also knew that it wasn't really in my budget. Well, lucky for me an old college friend of mine decided that he was coming to town for a visit. I sent him the websites for various restaurants and when he saw Alla Famiglia he said, \"Oh honey. Make the reservation - I've got it.\"  YES! I knew I kept him around for some reason!\n\nSo on a cold, snowy Saturday night, we trudged up the mountain. And it was glorious.\n\nFirst off, it IS in a bit of a sketchy neighborhood. But no worries - they have valet, so you don't have to deal with trying to find somewhere to park and walking around.\n\nThe Holy Oil is the best thing I've ever dipped bread into - and I'm a dipper. I come from an Italian family - we dip everything into everything - bread into sauce, cookies into coffee, bread into coffee, etc. This is by far the best dipping experience I've ever had.\n\nOnto the MEATBALL. We got the mozzarella-stuffed meatball for our appetizer. The meatball was good. The sauce was great. There isn't much more I can say about it, to be honest. It was just so, so yummy.\n\nSalad course: Great salad!\n\nPasta course: So, I was slightly disappointed that they did not give us a choice. I was really looking forward to the fettuccine in the cheese wheel that I had read about here! Alas, only vodka sauce. Great vodka sauce, though. I should've asked about that damn cheese wheel...\n\nFor the main course, I got the veal chop milanese and it was perfect. My friend got the cioppino and he enjoyed that very much.\n\nI could not even think about eating dessert. We had so much food. I took 1/2 of my pasta course and 3/4 of my main course home. I really wish I had gotten a dessert to go and eaten it later, though. \n\nI really cannot wait to go again.","I was in Pittsburgh my home town for a recent stay.  Alla Famiglia is the best restaurant I have been to in the Burgh.  It was consistent with the type of upscale dining I have gotten used to in Boston and I was pleasantly surprised.  The area surrounding the restaurant does not seem to be the safest locale, but worth going there for a wonderful dinner.  The service was exceptional!  The food was amazing with cheese plates, bread and side for the bread basket, meatball appetizer, cowboy steak with gorgonzola, and the halibut.  The tiramisu was the best I have had.  The addition of BYOB was a hidden gem as well.  I would highly recommend this for a special night out to celebrate.  Fantastic restaurant.","Simply outstanding...we had a large group (11) and everything was perfect. Several comments that this was the best Italian cuisine several of our group had experienced anywhere in the world.  Can't wait to go back!\n\nThe famous Meatball app did not disappoint (my fav was the stuffed peppers) and the many preparations of veal (main courses) were all exquisite.  \n\nAbsolutely recommend for any and all who are considering this fantastic establishment!","Just recently returned. PHENOMENAL meal! Glenn our waiter was superb. Loved the veal dishes.  I also enjoyed the new cocktail menu. One of the drinks was iced coffee with orangicello and frangelica cream. DELICIOUS!","This restaurant was phenomenal.   We went for my wife's 30th birthday with a large group of people and it was a great experience.  \n\nThe meatball and fried cheese appetizers were really good.  The marinara that came with the meatball was the best I have ever had.\n\nDon't go here if you are in a rush, because the entire dining experience will take several hours.  But we were there to enjoy the night, so we did not care.\n\nI would definitely recommend this to anyone as long as you are willing to spend the money.  If you do  appetizers, drinks and dinner it will run about $100 a person.  But I thought it was well worth it.\n\nThe wait staff was great.  Our server was Emmett and we had a lot of fun with him.  The owner/chef even came out and chatted with us on the upstairs outdoor patio.","My favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. Always delicious and I always order a different entree.

waiter was to be found about ten minutes later they gave us our water and left again! It wasn't even busy! There were only TWO dim sum carts floating around somewhere. Then our waiter finally came around and took our orders of lunch entrees. The food was not even that good as the reviews that are posted on here. When we came up to pay, the bill was super overpriced. I will not be returning here, I am better off eating at Great Wall Cuisine.","If this place had zero stars I would have given them that ! Let me start off by saying I was so excited to read all great reviews so maybe I just came in on a off day? We walked in and were seated came over and asked if we wanted water or tea I guess they don't serve anything Else, Then we placed an order pork dumplings and sticky rice nasty! Then I asked if they served egg rolls they said they were out!!! they pushed their little carts around with hot plates that basically steam the food and is not fresh and what you get is soggy poor customer service we had to get up and look for someone to give us our tab so we could get the heck out of there are get some real food. It looked like it would be a great place for groups of people would not recommend if you are on mission for what you want and want to place an order but it could be a fun experience for some people.","You walk into a Chinese restaurant on a Saturday afternoon for dim sum and you expect the place to be PACKED.  Well, walking in to a pretty much empty dining room, it's a VERY CLEAR SIGN.  But my friend insisted and I was very hesitant for good reasons.  Another indicator, the majority of the patrons were NON Asian.  \n\nFood: You walk in and you see carts of the food by the entrance to the dining room.  Umm, I thought dim sum should come right off the steamer and into the carts and they roll it around, not sitting around.  The dim sum was garbage.  It had the typical selection, but at minimum.  \n\nService: It's ok.  But it doesn't make up for the horrible food.\n\nBottom line: NO WAY!  Stay away!","I've been here many times...Mother's Day with family, dim sum with book club, etc. But I will not go back again.  I stopped in to ask the owner about a donation or reduced price for a class of under-privileged kids that I volunteer with.  His reaction was to scoff and shoo me out the door while handing me his card and saying I could email him.  He turned his back and headed off to the messy newspaper-strewn table he haunts between guests arrivals.  Maybe he's a community-minded business owner, but then again, maybe he's not.  I'll be dining elsewhere.","Being from Chicago, we are used to getting authentic Chinese food all the time.  But when we first starting spending a lot of time in Scottsdale/Phoenix, we found it a challenge to get authentic Chinese food.  We were excited to find the Golden Buddha and have made many trips over the years all the way from the Troon North area to get our fix.  However, service has declined to the point where it is no longer worth the aggravation.  We went there last night for Chinese New Year and will never go back.  Granted they were very busy because of a lot of large tables there, but waiting almost an hour to get our food is not acceptable under any circumstance!  45 mins. into our wait, the waitress came back (after we flagged her down to ask about our food) and said one of the dishes we ordered was not available....after 45 mins.!!!! What makes the whole experience an unforgivable one is that the manager/owner is so indifferent and never apologized or offered a discount off the bill...nothing.  When we left, the same manager was at the piano singing in Chinese. Huh?  Other than Nee House in Scottsdale, the search goes on for a restaurant that serves authentic Chinese food closer to home.","I will NEVER go there again.  I reserved a table for a group of 16 people for 5:00 PM on Christmas Eve .  The person on the phone ( I believe the manager) repeatedly asked me to call ahead and give him an accurate head count since he said they'd be swamped that day.  I followed up with him twice.  \nWhen the first couple of us arrived, we had menus shoved in our faces immediately and told we \"Must order now.  Must order now\" because they were going to be busy later on.  The place was practically empty.  As each person arrived, they were treated the same way. \nWe rushed and placed our orders and then they brought out our checks WAY before we saw any sign of our food.  I have never in my life been treated so rudely by a restaurant.\nIt was utter chaos when the food started coming out while everyone struggled to get the correct dish they ordered.  One person didn't get her food until we were all just about finished eating. \nOne top of all that, the food wasn't even good.  I've had better Kung Pao Chicken at Panda Express!\nAfter being rushed through our meal, the place wasn't even half full by the time we left.  I thought being at the Cultural Center, this restaurant would be a sure thing but boy was I wrong.  Lovely way to spend Christmas Eve..","If you are looking a chinese restaurant to host a big party look some other than the Golden Buddah.  I recently attended a banquet at the Golden Buddah and I was shocked at the level of quality of food and service.  Of the 10 dishes served 4 were nearly inedible.  \n\nThere was a crab claw appetizer, most chinese restaurants prepare this dish by taking a crab claw surrounding it with ground shrimp, batter and then deep fry.  At Golden Buddah, the crab claw served was mostly batter.  \n\nThe shark fin soup served was mostly broth.  Shark fin is an expensive ingredient and most places usually use imitation shark fin, but come on at least put something in there so that I know I'm eating soup and not dirty sink water.  \n\nGinger scallion lobster is battered, fried, and then stir fried in a sauce with ginger and scallions.  The ginger scallion lobster served was over-cooked and dried out.  \n\nLastly, there was a steamed fish.  The fish was raw in the middle.   \n\nIt wasn't all bad, there was a crispy chicken with garlic dish that was pretty good, but out of 10 dishes 4 were bad, 5 were okay, and 1 was good.  \n\nDoes 4 bad dishes out of 10 warrant a one star rating?  Well it does when you factor in the service.  The soup, appetizer, and first entree arrived timely, but after that there was a 1 hour gap before we received the next dish.  The dishes were not served with accompanying white rice which I thought was odd.  We had to ask for it, and even the rice took a while to arrive.","I agree with Crystal C., that the dim sum isn't the greatest I've ever had. In fact, I am not sure if the meal was so tasty that it was memorable. I do remember the \"calamari\" was not really calamari, like you would think. It was presented more like a sweet and sour pork (so calamari with LOTS of breading) without any sauce. As a result, the dish was dry and salty.\n\nThe sticky rice was good (hard to mess up), the chicken feet were okay (needed more five spice powder), and the shumai was alright. The noodles were good, and I can see why the cart ran out after the first round. The diners were an equal mix of Asians and Americans. I would've preferred to see more Asians eating (as I am used to in a Chinatown and gives an indication of authenticity), but I do realize we're in Phoenix where the Asian population is not like San Francisco or Houston. \n\nThe meal came to about $30 for two, including jasmine tea. The carts are loud because they are made out of metal and roll on tile. I am also not used to staff members shouting what they have in their cart, like a newspaper boy yelling \"Extra! Extra!\" Christmas music was playing after mid-January, so the atmosphere felt strange. Next time I visit the city, I probably will pass.","Can't say that I was very impressed. Came for dinner in a hopeful and enthusiastic mood since the reviews have been pretty good, but I don't think this place lives up to its current good, but declining rating.\n\nOrdered the Combo fried rice (shrimp, chicken, beef, pork), sesame chicken, and garlic fried chicken. \n\nThe combo fried rice was pretty good, but ended up drinking about 6 glasses of water due to the MSG and sodium content. You'd think that the cook spent his better years in the French Foreign Legion in the Sahara eating salt tablets and developed a taste for them. \n\nThe sesame chicken had a good flavor and a thick brown sweet sauce. I liked it a lot until it got cool and the sauce looked (with that stringy consistency) more like glue. You think I'm kidding? I'm not.\n\nGarlic fried chicken was bad. Just bad. It was like an over roasted dried out half chicken with some dried garlic pieces sprinkled on top. No spices, no flavor, no good. \n\nWe then got all kinds of lip from the waitress when we asked if they could change the channel on the TV from college football, to the Suns game. They made it into this big deal that the \"customers\" wanted to see the football game. Yeah right, it was University of West Virginia Vs. University of Connecticut! I would have believed it if it was a local team....\n\nIt's better than a 1 star joint, but only because it's borderline edible. To be avoided.","This restaurant is located in the Chinese Cultural Center and was the one restaurant that I had not been to. So after some shopping at one of the shops, we stepped in to have dinner.\n\nWe stepped in and asked for a seat for two. We were seated immediately. The place was decorated nicely and a lady playing the piano made for great ambiance.\n\nWe looked at the menu briefly and ordered our drinks, an appetizer, a soup and two main dishes. The drinks came out promptly and so did the rest of the meal. My goodness everything we ordered was very tasty.\n\nThe waiter service itself however was not even close to the decor and food. He never introduced himself, and although he took our order, our food itself was brought out by a kitchen person.\n\nAfter we ordered our waiter really never came back asking if we needed anything else, except to give us our check at the end and that was after the person I was dining with got up and asked a different waiter for it.\n\nIt's amazing how a place with great food, decor, and ambiance can mess it all up by crappy waiter service.","I love Dim Sum, my favorite Chinese dish.\n\nWhen Golden Buddha first open, they have excellent Dim sum. I went there many times, I tell my friend how good it is, But now,  they change cook, taste more like  week old left over. Rumor has it, they change cook every few month, so Quality of cooking change. (not sure if that is true, but that is what I was told.)\nMy advice is; when you walk in the door and the place is pack, = Good Cook. if the place is bare = bad cook. leave immediately. don't waste your money.","If you just \"want\" dim sum, go here. If you are \"craving\" dim sum, go elsewhere (take a 5 hour drive west to neighboring state, California).\n\nAnyway, I've been visiting Golden Buddha in the noontime for roughly 2 years now. I believe they moved from their original site (7th St. & Osborn), formerly \"China Doll.\" Relocation brought along better atmosphere and smiling faces. This does not mean, better dim sum. But since we are in Phoenix, I will settle for what they have to offer. \n\nBe mindful of the dim sum tab. It's itemized high-medium-low. \n\nShaomai can be found as combinations of pork/mushroom, shrimp, or shark fin (which should not be confused as true shark bits, as the shaomai is prepared to look like a shark's fin). These picks are okay...perhaps on a better day shao mai will be served in less-rigid, or fresher wrappers. Potstickers are okay as well, just the usual scallion and pork, and dry wrapper. The baby pork ribs in light black bean sauce and jalapenos is alright, but sometimes lacks in taste. Tripe is also served in its bare minimum...so if you enjoy the texture and flavor of tripe, try this with its clear sauce and thinly sliced carrots and celery.  \nBuche (that's what I call it), or fried sesame balls are also available, although if you wait until dessert, they will also be a bit stiff. There are a few other things that may be \"spotted\" but are not worth mentioning. \n\nDon't order from their lunch menu, as you can find these over-salted dishes at Panda Express anyway. \n\nOverall, dim sum at Golden Buddha is a place to go if you are around the vicinity and feel like having something apart from the usual fast food. However, discriminating palates- beware.","Not impressed with this place at all. This was not the friendliest place around, maybe because of the language barrier (most or all were clearly native Chinese speakers), or maybe just the attitude of the employees.\n\nI ordered the sweet and sour chicken lunch, which came with the typical egg drop soup, crab rangoon, and egg roll. The soup was ok - maybe it's just me, but I prefer a real spoon to the scoop that they gave me. The egg roll was tiny and not that great, and the crab rangoon was ok, but maybe a little undercooked. The chicken wasn't bad, but nothing special, as was the rice and other stuff on the plate.\n\nOverall, this was just not my kind of Chinese place.","Disappointing.  Mediocre at best.  I am staying at the Aloft hotel in phoenix and ordered some delivery. I ordered a couple american chinese food staples: general tso's chicken, dumplings and hot&sour soup.  Soup had zero flavor, dumplings tasted freezer burned and processed.  General tso chicken was ehh. \n\nA lot of good reviews on here so it must be for eat in and for their dim sum.  Don't order delivery, you will be left hungry and unsatisfied.","Went there on Saturday for early lunch.  My wife did the dim sum, it was okay, we were both disgusted by the sugar cane shrimp; but the rest was good.  \n\nI ordered the chicken szechwuan, the waitress warned me it was \"spicy\" the reason I ordered it.  It came out delicious, but not what I would call spicy.  Overall its hard to find good Chinese in the valley and I would call this good without hesitation.","So I was referred to this place from the front desk of my hotel. I'm from SF so I'm coming from a place with really good chinese food. \n\nThe dim sum is just \"ok\" nothing for me to write home about. The one dish that I really liked was the chinese broccoli cooked with garlic sauce. Yum yum yum.  It's in a big bowl, not oily, not saucy, just really good. I think it's $7.50.  \n\nIt's a somewhat pricey and just like all chinese restaurants, it's not the cleanest.  The chair was filthy.  the dishes weren't all that great.  I wouldn't go back unless I want the chinese broccoli.  \n\nSo I went on a Sunday and it was not crowded at all. There's not a huge asian population  in Phoenix (not that I could tell) so I don't think there's a high demand for dim sum.  And also, I sooooooo felt like taking a pic of this, but a Mexican lady was pushing one of the dim sum carts. That is unheard of in SF.  This is a mainly mandarin restaurant and the dim sum places I go are usually cantonese.  Not a big deal though since the dishes look the same. \n\nDude, there was a turtle in the fish tank that I saw as I left.  I hope they don't eat that!","A Premier Chinese Atmosphere,\nThe Chinese cultural center and Asian Garden produces an Asain atmosphere that can be recognized from the 202.  \n With Dim Sum served this location earns its respect from the local community.\n\nDim Sum tip,  You have to be smart with the Dim Sum ladies they look nice innocent but they are professional sales people that will sell you more dishes than you need before you know what to do.  \n\nI love the desserts here ask the server to see the dessert tray.","This restaurant has a bit of an identity crisis. It is in the Chinese cultural center, but serves Japanese beer (Kirin on tap!) and the live piano music is American pop. We had to ask for chopsticks.\n\nHaving said that, the service was professional. Our waiter held a hot appetizer for one of our party who was away from the table so that it would not be cold when he returned. We were asked frequently--and not too frequently--if things were ok both by our waiter and the manager/proprietor.\n\nThe food was ok-to-good. Fried shrimp egg rolls were dainty but yummy. Duck was tasty but very chewy. Kung-pao chicken was pleasantly spiced. Plenty of rice. A pitcher of ice water with lemon was left at the table. \n\nAtmosphere was also pleasant. Chairs comfortable, tables spaced well, restrooms large and clean...and there is indeed a large golden Buddha by the entrance.","I took a group of friends here and relatives other times. The place is consistently good for Dim-sum during lunch. It is typical Chinese and nothing fancy.\n\nWhat helps this place is the moat scenery.  3 stars for visiting here based on convenience since there are similar places in town.","Having grown up in Hong Kong and having eaten dim sum in London, NY, LA, SF and Vancouver (actually Richmond), I can confidently say I know my dim sum.\n\nGood selection of well-executed dim sum when the carts actually come around and there's anything left in it.  I'd give it 4 stars for food but the wait definitely detracted from the whole experience.\n\nI think the problem with Golden Buddha is that they can't handle the heavy flow on weekends.  There's not enough regular dim sum eaters like LA that can sustain a steady flow of diners throughout the week, forcing restaurants like Golden Buddha to depend heavily on extra part-time help on weekends.  \n\nDim sum takes serious skill so the chef still ends up doing most of the work.  When we looked into the kitchen, we saw a Chinese woman doing most of the cooking herself.  No wonder it took forever for a cart to come out and when it does, it's swarmed on by a pack of vultures.\n\nIf you're willing to eat at a more simply decorated place with a smaller menu, I'd highly recommend China Chan.  It's much more relaxed - usually no wait on weekends.  An experienced chef makes all the dim sum himself so the menu's much shorter but all the classics are on it.  Anything steamed is made to order so is very fresh.","Situated in the Chinese Cultural Center near the SkyHarbor Airport, this was another pleasant find. All I had was the Dim Sum menu, and I would say this is the best you're gonna get in Phoenix. Still worth the stop to get your Dim Sum fix. The cart ladies were pleasant and very happy to converse with me in Cantonese. Only downside was the chicken sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaves, naw mei gai, was way overcooked, and mushy.","Do you want to eat Chinese Food in an elegant environment on a Friday night in Phoenix? \n\nBe entertained by classic, quiet standards being played live on a piano while you dine?\n\nAre you 50 years old and Caucasian?\n\nThen the Golden Buddha is the place for you! \n\nIts in the Chinese Cultural Center Mall on 44th, and a popular weekend spot for Dim Sum. For a DIm Sum starved Valley of the Sun, Golden Buddha's is decent. \n\nFor dinner, though, it is awfully Americanized and not very authentic Chinese. But with a bunch of American customers coming for dinner, what do you expect? They probably think they are getting \"real Chinese\" food by going to the Chinese Mall, but then again, they are used to PF Chang's or Stix normally in their neighborhood, so this is a step up.\n\nThe best thing about this place is the decor, which is clean and nice, with a Hong Kong Junk boat design covering the ceiling from the bar into the dining room. The next best thing is the Piano interludes on weekend nights. The service is next, which is a little overly eager to remove your plate, and the last thing is the food. \n\nThey do give decent portions. I ordered Guo Teh (potstickers) and got 6 fat ones. But they weren't served with the usual soy, chili oil and vinegar, but a soy and green onions mixture. The Mapo Tofu was ok, as they used a nice silky tofu, which was nice, but no green onions, and sliced black mushrooms instead, which I like, but not in this dish.\n\nCome here for the ambiance and music in the evenings, or on the weekend days for Dim Sum.","Decent dim sum, especially to be found in the middle of the desert. Sadly, the best food I've had in Phoenix.","This place is a little difficult for me to review.  I was staying at the Hampton Inn across the street and this is the closest restaurant so off I went.\n\nI walked in and the owner or manager met me at the door and asked \"how many\"?\n\nI told him I wanted to order take out and handed me a menu and pointed to the waiting area which was covered in newspapers.  I chose to go to the bar, order a glass of wine, and peruse the menu.\n\nThe drinks are expensive but I didn't think the food was.  Less than $10 for my Mongolian Chicken which came with white sticky rice and a fortune cookie.  When ordering I asked if I could have fried rice instead of white rice but was told \"no\".  Most places allow this for a nominal fee.\n\nFine by me.  Give the white rice.  Food was prepared and their to-go boxes were a lot better than the standard white Chinese \"to go\" boxes.  They also included the plastic-ware, napkin, and soy sauce, which a lot of places forget.\n\nLooking around I found a whole lot of goodness along with a couple disappointments.  Most notably the newspaper strewn about and behind the bar, to the right were a lot of boxes stacked in an unsightly fashion.  I could have been a little more presentable in my opinion.\n\nI peeked into the dining room because I wanted to see if the piano music was piped in or live.  It was live which was very nice. Also, the dinning room looked very nice and cozy.\n\nAs I was leaving the same man who greeted me upon entering made sure to wish me a good evening.  My initial impression of the man was that he was surly and testy but that's just how he comes off.\n\nThe food was very good.  The Mongolian sauce was mixture of sweet with spice and the chicken and vegetables all tasted fresh.","My husband and I went there Saturday, the service was great!  Our friends were going to be late so they told us to start.  And start we did!\nThey were serving Dim Sum, something we had never tried, so glad we did, it was wonderful, hubby wouldn't do the chicken feet, but I think next time I will, it looked very good.\nOur friends showed up and ordered their food, and ate all of it, they said that usually they take food home, but it was so good they had to eat all of it!\nWe will be going back very soon!","Let's see, over 50... check \nold white man...........check \neats dinner ...............check \nlistens to the piano  check \n\nwow this must be the place for me, I mean after all it is in a Chinese mall, no make that a Chinese Cultural Center. How could I possibly have discerning taste with such trickery to get me here to eat. \nDude if you are going to rate a restaurant no need to degrade others with your arrogance. \nFool is my review of wanugee N. \n\nNow on the restaurant. The last time we were here the food was not good, the piano was too loud and the waitress had a real attitude. IT won't keep me from going back as I have had good meals and wait service too. \n\nBack to wanugee N. I do not expect any place in Phx. to have authentic Chinese food, by that I mean the street food one finds in China. \nBut I do expect what I fork in to my mouth is worth what I am going to fork over in cost. Even an old white guy like me can tell the difference between good and bad food. No matter what it is called.","Okay so Ive been glum the past few days as I have an impending birthday. Every year this time I get all down in the dumps.. not that I'm not happy with my life cause life is good. Its more like getting further away from my youth and closer to being well, old. All of my grandparents were crotchety, sourpuss drama queens.. is that my fate? Can I break the mold or am I to going to be a crotchety sourpuss?\n\nSo as I contemplate and figure out what I'm going to do with my birthday baggage I decide to squash it with food. All weekend Ive been eating out and having a good time. This is one of the few times outside of a vacation where I will live it completely and to the near of sheer gluttony. So why not dim sum? \n\nIve chowed much dim sum in my 36 years of earthen wear.. of course some good and some bad. I have never been to a place where every dish was great.. Golden Buddha is no exception to this.. they do the basics well enough and have enough funky cool Asian style to keep me interested in returning. The carts around 1130 flow well but around noon it' s full blown freeway action! In fact there might be some road kill in there based on some of the looks on that last steam cart.. \n\nMe and 3 others who were feeling my pain ordered 14, count them, 14 different dishes. One of my friends is from Georgia and had never had dim sum but he is so courageous and unflinching that he was just a blast. Just the shot in the arm to get me out of my funk. I remember the first time I had dim sum.. my eyes wide open, nostrils flared and excited to see what was under the next steamer lid. That was him today.. one exciting thing after the next.. he was even willing to try chicken feet but this is one of those dishes not done very well here. \n\nMy friend took me back to a time where I was younger and less experienced. He looked up to me to guide him through the noodles, bao and sui mai.. like a big brother.. I'm privileged that I could show him something new and exciting and he was so into it! So instead of feeling sorry for myself I felt experienced and useful.. that there is something I can give back to others.. that its not all about me and me aging but about what can be shared with others.\n\nThere is so much more to do, give and feel in this short time we are here.. and Ill do it to, one bite at a time.","The best to be found in land locked Arizona.  My favorite sticky rice is here.  They have dim sum every day, but not a huge selection, though you can order off the menu.  I think it is much bigger on the weekends.  I'm just happy I can get my fix 7 days a week.  Beautiful gardens to walk through, with fish ponds, and a 99 market next door!","I ate at Golden Buddha a few weeks ago.  We ate at the restaurant after a day at the zoo with our 4 year old and had a blast.  The piano bar played tunes for my daughter and the staff was more than accommodating.  The general tso chicken was better than anything I can get in Tucson.  The soup was chocked full of fresh, read FRESH, not canned, vegetables.  All in all, I was very satisfied with the meal and the service.  Plus the decor is very nice, clean and cheery. \n\nEat at Golden Buddha.","For those who gave this place low marks, forgive me. I really like this place. Now I haven't tried various dim sum places so I'm reserving the right to downgrade the place as needed. The variety of food is plentiful, and the carts just keep on coming. I love the steamed pork buns, and the shiu mai (not sure if I spelled that correctly). Yesterday, my favorite pick was the deep fried rolls of taro and shrimp. YUM! I have never ordered from their menu so I can only talk about their dim sum. My friends and I try to go eat dim sum almost every Sunday. It's a cheap way to try new foods, and if you don't like it, well.. you can get away with pushing it aside with minimal guilt. Give it a try! You might be surprised.","I like Golden Buddha, have taken many friends there for Dim Sum.  \nTry not to \"hit\" the dumpling cart to heavy; otherwise cannot finish it to the dessert cart (LOL).\nLove the jasmine tea and the staff willing to help you if you do not understand the what each item is.\nSingapore Rice Noodles a favorite, along with any of the shrimp dumplings; also the broccoli and green beans.\nOnly wish that the carts with eggplant stuffed with shrimp or green peppers with shrimp were not on \"heated\" carts; by the time it gets to you the food is cold.\nOnly concern is that went on 22MAY2010 at 1:30PM; there was a closed sign due to electricity???\nREVISED: 26MAY2010 - called this evening - looks like they are back open again.","I've been to the Golden Buddha on several occasions and it is my favorite, by far, for honest Chinese food. \nWhile I've sampled everything from their vegetarian to their beef, I love their mandarin chicken. More recently, I was delighted to relive the wonders of their Kung Pao Chicken and Beef with Broccoli. \nI absolutely love the egg drop soup and mini crab rangoons that come with the meal.","The very first time I went to Golden Buddha was with my BFF and it was our first dim sum experience. Little did I know this would forever change my life and eating experiences. Although I must admit that first time was a bit awkward.\n\nGB wisely takes reservations which was wonderful (even though it wasn't crazy busy). Our assorted dim sum plates were flavorful and fresh. And the carts seemed to be in constant rotation so we were never too far from a good selection.\n\nWhat really helps GB is its location. The Cofco Center is an experience in itself, where one can have herbs specially blended, select a fresh member of marine life to take home and cook or browse through a store with one of the largest selections of Buddhas and hand fans I've experienced outside of San Francisco.","I've been to Golden Buddha a few times and have not been disappointed. \n\nThey have a LARGE selection of Dim Sum and if you're not careful you can get carried away.\n\nTry and get there early and you'll get the best and most fresh selection.\nMake sure you walk around the garden when you're done.","Probably the most comprehensive Chinese menu in the Valley.  Pick from well over 100 dishes, but if you want the best order the Peking Duck.  Everything else is very good, but without a wow factor.  You'll see lots of Chinese people in this massive restaurant, which probably means they're doing a fine job in the kitchen.","I very much enjoyed eating here. Food was great. Fairly fast service. Wasn't expensive either for the 4 of us.","Golden Buddha has GREAT dim sum.  Their prices are reasonable and the staff is very polite wheeling their little carts.  I tend to go on the weekend because there is more selection but they do dim sum throughout the week.  They also have some very authentic dishes on the menu for those who are more of the adventurous types.  Be sure to say hello to the turtles the next time you go.","This place in the Chinese Cultural Center has a very pretty and elegant bar area. I was pleased to learn that they had some very reasonable and delicious happy hour snacks. This is a good place for a Pina Colada. I had one by myself along with some dumplings and fried shrimp appetizer. Sadly I never brought anyone else here with me. It was happy hour heaven but you know? A lot of my friends in AZ pretty much hang out in one neighborhood or another and nobody I know really lives close to the Buddha.\nThe airport is pretty close by. This might be a good pre-flight send-off location.","I have had dim sum in New Orleans and Phoenix (not SF), and this is about equal to the best of New Orleans as far as flavor.\nAs for ambiance, today was a good day. I've had dim sum here about a dozen times, and have had very good service and quality 90% of the time, including weekends. I have had bad days here, but since today was good, I'll rate accordingly. It's closer to a 4.5, but since I can't give half-stars, I rounded up.\nDon't expect me to give these the right names, but... I was less than impressed with the bbq pork balls. They tasted too much like honey and the beef was minimal. The bbq sauce tasted bottled. Outside of that, their herbal hot tea is delicious even on a hot day.\nThe shu mai were very good, and the shrimp in a spinach dumpling was fantastic. A definite don't miss is their sticky rice in lotus leaf. It's among the best I've had anywhere. Just be careful; you'll find bones in it every once in a while. Go for any of their steamed dumplings; they're very flavorful. As others have said, I love the Chinese broccoli, but you'll only find it on the carts on weekends. Otherwise order it off the menu.\nToday (11:30 lunch) the carts came around often, and everything except the pork buns was piping hot and fresh. By the way, despite the price increases, even the sticky rice was considered a medium size entree, and the two of us eating there escaped with a bill under $20 and we were done in under 30 minutes.\nI strongly recommend the dim sum here, whether you've had it a million times or have never had it before. You usually won't be disappointed.","I don't really understand the poor reviews on this place.....maybe it depends on the day you go? We went on a Sunday, it was crazy busy, but service was great! (of course, my view of customer service is a little different then the rest... I used to live on an island where you were just happy to find what you were looking for, let alone expect good customer service) Anyways, our server was very sweet! Always had a smile on her face. The carts served us promplty and none of the food was cold. They always had whatever we wanted (I hate having to wait for the next cart).\n\nNow, as for the actual dim sum and food.......holy cow, to die for! So flavorful and fresh!! The broccoli makes you sing...and the wine noodles, make you cry. You leave with very weird mixed emotions, but mostly a happy belly full of yummy food.\n\nIn my opinion, this is the best dim sum I have been able to find in Phx. I'm ditching my previous spot (Mekong Palace) and will be back to Golden Buddha when the dim sum monster strikes again!"],"type":["Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Low Rating","Medium Rating","Medium Rating","Medium Rating","Medium Rating","Medium Rating","Medium Rating","Medium Rating","Medium Rating","Medium Rating","Medium Rating","High Rating","High Rating","High Rating","High Rating","High Rating","High Rating","High Rating","High Rating","High Rating","High Rating","High Rating","High Rating","High Rating","High Rating","High Rating","High Rating"],"type_color":["#FEF5D6","#FEF5D6","#FEF5D6","#FEF5D6","#FEF5D6","#FEF5D6","#FEF5D6","#FEF5D6","#FEF5D6","#FEF5D6","#FEF5D6","#FEF5D6","#FEF5D6","#FEF5D6","#E39A73","#E39A73","#E39A73","#E39A73","#E39A73","#E39A73","#E39A73","#E39A73","#E39A73","#E39A73","#C01400","#C01400","#C01400","#C01400","#C01400","#C01400","#C01400","#C01400","#C01400","#C01400","#C01400","#C01400","#C01400","#C01400","#C01400","#C01400"]}},"id":"f242d54b-1163-4814-a4e2-0da1ab9f389a","type":"ColumnDataSource"},{"attributes":{"text":{"field":"display"},"text_align":"center","text_alpha":{"value":0.1},"text_baseline":"middle","text_color":{"value":"black"},"text_font_size":{"value":"15pt"},"x":{"field":"symx"},"y":{"field":"namey"}},"id":"3cf142ca-6cc8-4e2a-98f7-5a9f4078e5a3","type":"Text"}],"root_ids":["95d5f57d-2f73-4b07-9082-31e949e731a7","61bd3dd7-7be0-4647-82df-2943e2ebd6ea","869261aa-d85c-4e8e-b37a-fd081374a902","7cb9ac87-7be1-4f05-9835-8b1d77f65911","8aa0ecaf-7f71-4a9b-8fa0-ded6c2170cb7","d66f2e91-0688-4688-856b-0abf0d396728","96c5619b-c432-4718-b10c-b0bbb02fe855","678abe4c-7dc5-46dd-8722-fa5f6fd56218","d275d0f9-4489-41af-bd7a-2e305c1c54c2","08cf43a8-cb9f-453a-8109-d7ff621a9f99","20b6cc0e-669a-4584-99e1-3240c6d0836e","dc9480c6-6cca-4f5c-b1f0-08c3433feafa","e992f2a9-dfe1-45f1-9698-fd1d0d87aed9","fad3051d-5dfb-4002-bc9c-c3a37aad584f","89b49f5c-e30a-4a04-be30-78390c20e948","5dd6b63f-0ffe-4e51-b986-6bcd6e9e64ff","80871752-0178-4aa1-97fd-c3c86136afdb","aefa652c-8304-4e47-bd6c-c21ea5c7fafd","09716f07-4de5-457a-b741-67e9441efb6e","0c34a805-4250-4c7a-a404-5415e1e0adcb","1c95d94b-6c66-4691-9f35-b0aaeeea09b3","6bd4f3b2-8686-4bb0-b134-053d956c43c6","d508bb9a-1b20-421a-911d-37534caa0a71","d23de588-3a20-4219-9a31-1e865a8b785a","2fad0906-e3d6-41a6-943a-9b82809e5a7b","2a35eba6-824f-4fea-88af-17b85542ea97","c931a2c4-7435-4f72-819f-8564a330e34c","01b35764-1184-499f-a8df-24034825f383","d143fb1e-6b53-4984-bcf2-1c292e9fe28c","2a3b8e4f-a586-4d74-aba5-15abb683966e","472fbd4b-cdf0-472c-8856-d5b26b33c4af","4811631a-cbf0-4418-8ecd-2f8454997a7e","b86de3a8-4ec5-4741-843a-f3dcaa466cc7","0787ba29-f096-40a8-b243-e923be3a4b9a","10440289-f06f-4153-b1e9-cbb65907bfe4","1596422d-cbbe-48e1-9413-60fd85b5c750","c5a51b15-7570-46d7-817f-eafe8af61c1d","8fdeba6e-b159-47a7-b102-8faaf4ac68b9","2a3ecef6-ecec-4b9c-8260-fce11132a4da","1569c097-84e8-40b7-839d-e5b7bfcb1f3e","c3bfd995-a02b-4148-97b2-0459cb1c463f","21ba0e9e-0526-4143-8a35-f844b302900a","26e757d9-6e65-4013-b5eb-e984d0efbb5e","7eb03616-edf6-408e-bc2a-432a3d9d005a","8ad14ff9-f329-4fd0-8d54-778864cd112a","2b75357e-66c8-4556-b986-4d671be2071c","46f3f757-73a4-4a3f-a08b-ab4538de61aa","377d5db7-af8f-4eb9-b8b9-d04fb706e8f4","c0c13610-3d37-473f-af2d-2177ce707a82","ba26d3f2-431a-4e86-abe8-977732b5d936","05c5739f-e296-4737-ad2c-1292b5ea0453","718c4d56-f5ee-4160-954f-327e86c64215","908120a0-41b9-4535-a7c5-079081d4900e","b628a850-9e83-499f-9279-910610ffc6fc","dc449331-e5ba-438c-a684-a9663a0fb97f","9cfff2ce-c536-4634-9d48-b92653854855","8cd69b1b-7856-41c1-a747-996a89363e38","426be8de-96f5-47db-82e1-913bbd4ade08","5015af5c-9dce-49cc-b95c-98862d983377","1e6007a4-de00-4e94-8ab0-247919738384","c0bb4578-859a-4f1f-a63f-fda16346ae79","82629084-8c93-4a94-bd29-f0c451a4bce2","9f8f5def-7437-4a86-8b12-17757f144901","6dc723e8-a3fb-4f58-8fee-b5e23d3f26da","6c419cac-6c0a-4a4b-8ec1-c366c56061ff","934f7564-830d-4983-bb63-ef335182eea9","4bf6ac40-edb4-4ab4-bc52-616f2855e300","af1978a7-8128-482d-8194-606651f20506","6bddcebd-a566-4bb6-8452-e9d2d22f3ef8","065140c1-29ed-4f90-812f-8bfbbca2dd7f","b0d58ecf-6bda-4388-b50e-74b17ad73fe1","0696b4f8-097b-4c2a-b39e-d345b0f87618","07a3c5d4-2b89-43b1-95a0-cf691c7e681d","28964dc2-06f0-4e44-b5dd-d26d4c85ac9e","c059f674-efbe-42b7-af80-c17c5c5ae440","bfb139ba-9811-48f9-8440-bdcc86b51b5e"]},"title":"Bokeh Application","version":"0.11.1"}};
