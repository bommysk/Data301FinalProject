I'm a guy, I've got a short haircut.  Nothing fancy -- short on the sides and back, an inch on top.  Pretty easy in MY opinion.\n\nThe stylist \"didn't do\" clipper cuts, even though that's what I requested for the sides -- it's really the only way to get the sides short.  Instead she went with scissors and a comb.  Took 3x longer, and the result was a mess....a big strip of hair down the back that was probably twice the length of the sides.  \n\nThe top wasn't even and was kind of a mess.

Every stylist would inevitably refuse to do it because red was \"too unpredictable.\"  Dejected, I was debating on going back to my last salon where I had less than a positive experience or trying this place based on a male friend's recommendation.\n\nI was hesitant, knowing that men and women's hair were different.  I wanted much more than a $26 trim and the relationship a woman has with her stylist is quite personal.  \n\nJennie got me in her chair and told me she'd not only color my hair red but was really excited about doing it!!  She needed minimal direction and gave me the edgy cut I wanted in record time (I was in and out in less than 2hrs).  She was upbeat, perky and really a great person to be around.  My hair looks fantastic and I started getting compliments from other women getting their hair done before I even left the salon.  \n\nAt $145, it was the most I've ever spent for a cut and color (pretip) and I've been getting it colored professionally for a while.  But honestly, for the entire experience, it was well worth it.  Jennie knows what she's doing with color, products, a straight razor and shows a great knowledge of current styles.  \n\nIf you're looking for a new salon, I would absolutely recommend this location.  The staff was very friendly and chatty and offered tea, water, wine or coffee.  Nothing but positive experiences to be had here! \n\nOh and a GREAT perk: you can book your appointment online anytime.  I work nights right now and 2am was the only spare time I had to book.  It was so easy!  While I believe they take walk ins, I would definitely recommend booking a consultation first since its so easy to do it from their website.", "type": "review", "business_id": "qicXiOKmN-GFubYuiPAFKg"}

You will get your pocketbook emptied at most places.

Half of the restaurant is glass and overlooks the city.  Most of the tables line the windows.\n\nThe food itself was decent.  I had their \"spots\", which was a crusted and pan fried white fish. It was good but was it $20 good? Not so much.  The salad that accompanies the meal had a housemade balsamic vinaigrette to die for. I think I could've just eaten the balsamic vinaigrette for dinner and been good. Other diners in our party had the carbonara (proclaimed good, but not great), a shrimp with clams and garlic butter sauce pasta dish (proclaimed very tasty), and the house special that night (a pork roast that had some bold flavors that were too bold per the person who had it). We had two ice teas, a cosmo, and two beers.\n\nTotal for the meal (with tax) was $116. \n\nI can't say I had warm fuzzies for the place. It wasn't great. It wasn't bad. It just was.

In a restaurant that is more or less in a food court. Being surrounded chinese joints, mexican burrito places, and the philly cheese steak place.\n\nWhile I think it would be a solid bet for dinner as well --- that's not how I see this place positioned.

The portions were large and the prices were very reasonable. I ordered the Virginia Spots with crab meat and broccoli and loved it! The house salad and balsamic vinegarette were very tasty...I would eat salads more often if I had that dressing at home. We ordered the zucchini fritti and the waitress was nice enough to warn us that the portions were huge and recommended a half order. My boyfriend ordered the crab cakes and green beans, he liked his meal too...I didn't try them but his green beans came with roasted red peppers and they looked so good! \nThe bad: I always order a vodka and cranberry when I go to restaurants, and I've never had any automatically assume I wanted top shelf (grey goose)...they've either asked what kind of vodka or given me the standard, so my drink almost cost as much as my meal. Not the biggest deal though.  I enjoyed my drinks.  The big downfall was the parking. The restaurant said that they validated the parking garage under the building, and the hostess gave us a ticket for the parking garage as soon as we walked in.  No explanation with it, so we assumed it was pretty straight forward, put it in the machine and go.  However, when we were leaving and put the ticket in the machine, it wouldn't accept it, so the attendant came over to help us.  We explained our situation, and he said we owed $15? If we had to pay any additional fees, one would think that either the restaurant or the ticket would have said so.  My boyfriend only had a $20, and the attendant didn't have any change of course so we paid $20 to park in that garage. One of the selling points of that restaurant when friends told us about it was that they validate parking. Had I known that was going to happen, we would have parked at one of the cheaper garages around the block.

Growing up in Latrobe I had become accustomed to mediocre, chain pizza. Not until I was about 12 did I get my first taste of super thin, floppy, extra cheesy, greasier than normal pizza. This was the stuff I dreamed of. My dad took me here prior to my first ever Pens game. The Villa holds a soft spot in his heart as well due to the many many post work nights he spent here slugging beers and eating pizza with friends. \n\nFast forward 13 years and now I am the one working downtown, slugging beers and eating post work pizza. Unfortunately though, Villa Reale has become so expensive that treating it as a weekly stop is a bit unreasonable. While the pizza is still super thin, floppy, extra cheesy, greasier than normal, I have trouble paying $15 for a slice of pepperoni, a coke, and a side salad. On another occasion my dad requested to come here as his payment for helping me move. A medium calzone, a slice of pepperoni, and two cokes ran me $35. \n\nVilla Reale, please come to your senses and adjust your prices.

Since the move from NY, I'd been really craving some quality, New York-style pizza, and hadn't had a ton of luck finding any (although the search introduced me to some excellent \"Pittsburgh-style\" pizza joints, so I'm not complaining.)  \n\nVilla Reale really came through.\n\nI loved that you could order a slice with basically whatever toppings you wanted (I'm used to being at the mercy of whatever \"slice\" pie has been languishing under a heat lamp for 3 hours).  I ordered a pepperoni and sausage slice, and the small feast that was presented to me did not disappoint.  The slice was huge, the pepperoni crispy, the sauce really balanced (not too sweet, not too garlicy), the cheese fresh and delicious and the crust...oh man...thin and crisp on the outside, pillowy soft on the inside.  One slice was perfect to fill me up for lunch, too.  \n\nFull disclosure: while the wait staff is so friendly, they do get overwhelmingly busy at lunch.  We went to the place at 11:00 so we could sit at a table (if you want to dine-in and order a slice during lunch, you can only sit at the counter, not a table, after 11:30) and by 11:30 the place was standing room only.  My coworkers informed me that somehow, their pizzas are even better when ordered by the pie (hard for me to fathom) and also that their hoagies are delicious, so I'm sure I'll be trying one of those next time.  \n\nIt's not the most inexpensive pizza joint downtown (I think my slice ended up being $4-$4.50) but if you're a recovering Noo Yawker like me looking to fulfill some culinary nostalgia, this is your place.", "type": "review", "business_id": "l-OmDgEd4QkZpyXVpkp2yA"}

My friends and family remain fascinated by the new patterns she twists my hair into...and I'm a guy, so I like the attention! ;^)\n\nTerry typically twists my hair initially, then finishes them off as three-part braids, so that they will hold longer. I personally like this look, because it appears more \"full\", and yet still has some life to it.. She's so good, no one ever guesses that I'm gradually thinning on top, and versatile enough that we've switched this look up from time to time.\n\nIn professional settings, my hair is always stylish enough to merit compliments, never so \"busy\" that people do double-takes.\n\nTerry is really phenomenal.

These two stylists are experts with all textures of hair, and I've recommended them both for years and continue to do so.\n\nSo, if you think you can handle getting compliments as soon as you leave the hair salon, go to SALON NUVO and ask for Terry (or Chris).

As the 500 degree plate came out with the glorious aroma of perfectly cooked meat sizzling in butter, I knew I was not only in for something special, but a livelong love.\n\nRuth's Chris is a franchise and the setting in different cities can be quite variable.  The Philadelphia Ruth's Chris is right next to the Academy of Music with gas lamps lighting Broad St.  The Boston's Ruth's Chris is in old city hall with a beautiful ceiling 2 stories up in the bar area.  Pittsburgh's Ruth's Chris cannot boast such extravagance in their setting, but the food is equally outstanding in all their restaurants.\n\nMy recent venture to Ruth's Chris was with 4 other young men in a \"guys night out.\"  I brought several bottles of wine (you have to love the PA Chairman's selection) because Ruth's Chris amazingly allows you to do this.  We started with the seared Ahi tuna.  It was raw, thick, and delicious.  Actually, it kind of tasted like steak.\n\nWe each went on to get various cuts of meat.  I personally rolled with my favorite:  NY Strip, medium rare (correctly done with a blood red center), extra butter.  The extra butter is key.  If you're going to roll with a decadent feast of steak, might as well pull out all the stops.  It was brought out absolutely perfect and delicious.  The table also shared the excellent huge family-style sides of asparagus and garlic mashed potatoes.\n\nOur server was extremely gracious.  She opened and decanted a couple of our bigger bottles as soon as we sat down to give them time to breathe.  They arranged for us to have a cab-van at the end of our meal to take us to our next location.  \n\nIf I was really searching for something negative to say, it's that I wish that the Pittsburgh Ruth's Chris was in a more extravagant setting like some bigger cities.  However, since the main menu is exactly the same, Ruth's Chris is forever my go-to location for a perfect steak dinner.", "type": "review", "business_id": "0FgwBx7pgmNdUtsd_T8UYQ"}

I come here about 4 times a year. When I do go I prepare myself by not eating red meat several days prior to going. On the day of I make sure to eat a normal but smaller breakfast. No bagels as they occupy too much space. I arrive a bit later, I am a bit hungrier and the staff that remains are long time regulars who know me but are also there to earn a living and make my visit worthwhile. I always order a filet, medium with mushrooms. I don't drink when go, the beef is too good to have my senses misdirected. The plate and filet arrive in minutes, the plate is sizzling at 500 degrees, if by chance there is too much red in the meat I cut a piece and sizzle it right there on the plate. I recently tried the salmon on a recommendation from the owner and was wowed how good it was. Panko crumbs and lemon, great stuff. \nI always feel they go the extra mile for me but the food and service are always top notch i can assume this is the standard.", "type": "review", "business_id": "0FgwBx7pgmNdUtsd_T8UYQ"}

If the rating was strictly based on food, I'd go with 5, easily. But, it's based on service, too, which is why I had to knock one off. Here's the deal...\n\nI love Morton's. Its old-school interior and no-gimmicks shtick is awesome. Plus, of course, the food is fantastic. However, I wanted to branch out, and Ruth's Chris had some great reviews, so I utilized Yelp's oh-so-convenient Open Table reservation feature, and scored a table for two on a Saturday night. \n\nOur reservation was for 8:30. We arrived right on the dot, but were told to go to the bar and wait. So, my boyfriend and I both got cocktails -- he had Glenlivet, which is obvs hard to mess up, and I got the Peachy Pear-tini, which was delish. And then, we waited. And waited. Around 9, our table was ready. \n\nOur waitress was Kristen, and she was fantastic. Very attentive, friendly, witty, and knowledgeable about the food. Here's our food rundown:\n\n- Barbequed shrimp app: I initially thought was BBQ sauce + shrimp, but it ain't. It's succulent li'l shrimp in a deliciously garlicky, white wine-infused sauce with a cayenne kick. Kristen suggested that we dip the bread in the sauce after the shrimp were gone, and we happily took her up on that. \n\n-Ruth's chopped salad: Holy crap. The most memorable salad of my life. I rarely rave about salads. In fact, I think this is the first time I ever have in my life. But, this salad was incredible! It has crispy onion strings on top, hearts of palm (which I love), and this amazing lemon-basil dressing, among other delicious things. So awesome.\n\n- Filet mignon: My boyfriend and I both opted for the filet. I got mine with extra butter, he got his with a bleu cheese crust. Mine was phenomenal. The sizzling butter really adds an extra dimension of flavor that puts it beyond Morton's. My boyfriend found the bleu cheese to be a li'l too generous, and he wound up scraping some off, but still enjoyed it.\n\n- Broccoli au gratin: Again, phenomenal. I've never enjoyed broccoli so much. Granted, it was swimming in bubbling, gooey cheese...\n\n- Potatoes lyonnaise: We took a risk here, as many people rave about the garlic mashed potatoes, and we saw mountains of them carried past our table. But, it paid off big-time. These were, hands-down, the BEST lyonnaise potatoes EVER. Pamela's has nothing on these. Every mouthful was a medley of crusty brown potatoes and caramelized onion goodness. I dream about these potatoes.\n\nSo, based on that experience, we went back again the next Saturday. Different waitress, same food (literally, we ordered exactly the same items, 'cause they were so damn good). I don't remember the waitress' name that we had the second time, but we waited longer for food to appear, were checked on far less, she took the cocktail shaker with my extra martini in it before I'd gotten to pour it in my glass, our steaks were not done correctly (he got my medium-rare, I got his medium-well), and it took forever to get the check. I really think it ruins the experience when you're done eating and ready to go, and you're just sitting there, drumming your fingers, looking around the dining room and wondering, \"Where the hell is the waitress with our check?\" \n\nThat said, we will definitely be back. We'll just request to be seated in Kristen's section! :)", "type": "review", "business_id": "0FgwBx7pgmNdUtsd_T8UYQ"}

The legendary steakhouse is supposedly the final word in steak outside of NYC and Texas. If this is the case then my oh my how the mighty have fallen. I have been to several Ruth's Chris locations around the PA, NY, and NJ area, but the one here in Market Square is truly a disappointment. \n\nWhen I go to a real steakhouse, like Peter Luger's, or the Old Homestead, or any other Ruth's Chris location I have visited, I expect to pay top dollar for top dollar steaks. I will never complain about the price so long as I feel as if the quality and quantity of food as well as the dining experience I recieve is fair in proportion to what I pay. The cheapest steak in the M2 Ruth's Chris will run you about thirty dollars. Normally, this would not be a problem had the establishment lived up to its reputation. Sadly, however, they did not.\n\nFirst, let's start with the decor. Ruth's Chris is a chain, first and foremost. That being said all locations are going to have the same basic look: old wood, magnum wine bottles, white tableclothes and red walls. I expect this sort of thing in a steakhouse. They are the last holdouts from the old industrial capitalist era. I feel as if I were to walk in, I might see Andrew Carneghie or John Rockefeller sitting at the bar discussing how unffair anti-trust legislation is.\n\nContinuing with the bar, Ruth's Chris offers a fantastic wine selection that has a pleasant mixture of affordable, yet quality, choices as well as a few that would cost me six months' rent. They also have a decent coctail menu, no doubt created by a corporate mixologist, that I must say is good. My girlfriend is not a fan because she can actually taste the alcohol in the majority of the concoctions, but I think that is a good thing. The bar is about the only place where you get the quality for the money you are spending.\n\nThe most dissappointing aspect about my last few visits have been the steaks. Ruth's Chris is known for basting their steaks in butter, which I do like. Fat is deliscious and that is proof enough for me that we are meant to eat it. This is where the goodness ends. On my second to last visit, a member of my party was served a rancid steak. The server tried to say it was dry-aged, but dry-aging does not produce a metallic, green beef. On my most recent visit, I was served a filet mignon that was tough. I have no idea how they were able to serve a tough portion of the least used muscle on the cow, but they did.\n\nAll of this brings me back to the service. I understand you are working in a fine dining, expensive steakhouse. I get that you throw down $300 plust dollar checks thirty or so times a night. I get that you are on first name basis with the Pens, Bucs, and Steelers that call themselves your regulars. That does not make me chop liver. I feel that if you are not wearing at least $3,000 worth of clothes or accessories, the staff will basically ignore you.\n\nThe saving grace to the place would be the bar and decor I already mentioned, and the sides. Ruth's Chris, like most fine dining establishments runs an a la carte menu. The sides are usually very very good. I like the sauteed mushrooms, sauteed spinache, lyonaise potatoes, macaroni and cheese, and the wedge salad.\n\nAll in all, this place gets a two in my book. I think that this is kind of sad given the fact that I was hoping to give them a five, but the quality of the food compared to what you pay just is not up to standard. For $250 I can feed and booze six friends at my house instead of me and my girlfriend at Ruth's Chris.", "type": "review", "business_id": "0FgwBx7pgmNdUtsd_T8UYQ"}

Heavy cafe curtains and shutters cover the windows - closed in to the point that you don't realize half the restaurant is glass! It could just as easily be in a basement.

We were greeted by friendly staff and walked through the room that smelled of wonderful steak. We were seated and our waiter was very friendly and knowledgeable. Everything was fine until we got the food which was disappointing. I ordered off the special menu and had the corn chowder, a filet and lobster tail, a side of creamed spinach and dessert for about $55. My husband had the cowboy ribeye for $65, the scallops to start and a side of brussel sprouts. \n\nThe corn chowder was ok but not very hot. The scallops which came recommended were ok but they were on a pesto sauce which was simply too overpowering for the delicate scallop. We used the pesto to dip the bread in. The steaks came and were both overcooked. They were supposed to be medium rare but my filet was well done and his was more like medium. We should have complained but we decided to just eat bc we didn't want to wait and didn't think that they would be less well done since they come on a scorching hot plate. My husband liked the brussel sprouts but my creamed spinach was not hot and was stringy. \n\nAgain, the food was mediocre but the staff was extremely friendly. I booked on opentable and told them that it was his birthday and they did bring him a complimentary dessert. I prefer Morton's, Ditkas and Peter Luger's.", "type": "review", "business_id": "0FgwBx7pgmNdUtsd_T8UYQ"}

It also could have been my imagination, but I think I got a quizzical look for getting something other than pizza. It's not an attractive place to hang out, so it's no wonder delivery is their thing.\n\nI got a falafel wrap with a side of fries. The veggies on the wrap were lackluster, though the falafel and pita were acceptable. I was given a little cup of some kind of sauce, but what I really would have liked on it was hummus. I wouldn't be surprised if they'd provide it if asked, but it's not there by default.\n\nIt was all kind of meh to me.

We were planning to get take out and have a picnic at the concert, but alas, rainy weather struck (surprise, surprise!), so we ended up having dinner here before heading over to Heinz Hall, where the concert had been relocated due to the weather.\n\nCM and I ordered a medium Moroccan spiced chicken and plum pizza to share ($14.99), and our friends each ordered pide, with one ordering the Ephesus, and the other ordering the soujcuk ($9.49 each).  Both CM and I enjoyed the complex medley of flavors and textures comprising the chicken/plum pizza, which was complemented by a cup of seemingly homemade ranch sauce served with the pizza.  The plums were dried, and weren't overwhelmingly sweet or fleshy, and lent the perfect hint of sweetness to the savoriness of the chicken and the spicy kick of the sauce.  The sliced nuts (almonds, I believe) were also a nice touch, and the size was more than enough for the two of us.  My only major criticism was that the myriad of toppings made the pizza a bit unwieldy to eat, and often fell off as we ate it.\n\nThe pide were rather long and thin in profile, and were each topped by a pepper.  I didn't try the Ephesus version, which is topped with ground beef, due to my aversion for that meat.  I did try a slice of the sojcuk pide, however, which is topped with cheese and Turkish pepperoni.  While the pepperoni were different in flavor than traditional pepperoni, the overall effect was reminiscent of eating traditional pizza that just happens to be long and thin.  I didn't try the greens that came with the pide, but they seemed similar to those used to top the chicken/plum pizza, and our friends weren't fans of the sauce, which they found rather oily and flavorless.  However, I did try the tzatziki sauce served with their pide, which was thick and had a great cucumber-yogurt zip.\n\nOne important thing to note is that Ephesus seems to have relocated since several of the previous reviews were written--they are now located at street level on 4th Ave., and the space is actually rather nicely decorated for a pizza parlor.  Having said that, judging from the amount of phone calls and runs of the delivery guy, the majority of their business still seems to consist of delivery.  Overall, we were pleased with our experience, and would return to try some of their other offerings.", "type": "review", "business_id": "nBl_NeArpL08MpoghDiA_A"}

The flat top grill is behind the counter in the front and the back of Peppi's has a couple tables and booths with Steelers paraphernalia on the walls.\n\nI wasn't too hungry so I ended up ordering \"The Phantom\", which was a cheese steak with grilled mushrooms, onions, and a fried egg.  My companions got a mushroom cheese steak and the famed #7, the \"RoethlisBurger\" itself.  All the sandwiches come with the basic fixin's of lettuce tomato, etc. and are a foot long.\n\nThe Phantom was a little smaller than I expected, but the flavors of the ingredients in the sandwich melded together wonderfully.  My only complaint is that I would have liked a little more meat.  After some searching online, apparently all their steak subs only have a quarter pound of steak.\n\nFor some reason based on the picture of the RoethlisBurger in the window outside we thought it was going to be a lot bigger.  I guess camera angles can be deceiving.  It's a mix of chopped burger and sausage with American cheese and a fried egg.\n\nOverall I would have liked it a bit more if the sandwiches were served a bit faster (some people who ordered after us got their food first) and a bit more meat.\n\nAnyways, I'm definitely going to be back to try the RoethlisBurger since now I view it as a potentially tasty sandwich as opposed to just a ridiculously impossible food challenge.", "type": "review", "business_id": "J011r7mUV1QhgLJ7GkrtMw"}

Really, Peppi's uses the best bread for their sandwiches and that, in my opinion, is what makes a sandwich.  \n\nLocated in the Strip District, you can shop your extra sandwich weight off after lunch by visiting any of a few dozen specialty shops in the historic district.  \n\nYinz'll love it!", "type": "review", "business_id": "J011r7mUV1QhgLJ7GkrtMw"}

The rest of the restaurant is composed of a number of different tables and booths, lots of wood and earthy colors and has some decorations consisting of Pittsburgh sports and Peppi's regulars.\n\nBoth my father and I decided to get a regular Italian hoagie on this day and they were brought to our table within 10 minutes of us ordering.  The sandwich itself looked pretty good and consisted of genoa salami, rosa salami, capacola and provolone cheese all on a nice bun that was just short of a foot.  I also decided to go with the lettuce, onion and dressing that was offered to me but said no to the tomato. Overall I thought that the taste of my sub was pretty good although I wouldn't have guessed that there was two kinds of salami and some capicola in it.  The bread may have been my favorite part of the sandwich as it seemed to be rather fresh.  I could also see some people complaining about the bread to filling ratio here as there seemed to be a lot more bread than filling but personally I was ok with it.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.

He adores this place. We usually go to the one on the North Side (their back yard area is adorable!) but they were closed on the particular day we were planning to make a visit, which led us to the Strip. The seating is limited, so on a busy day, you may not be able to get a table. My mom, dad, boyfriend and I were able to find a table easily when we visited. My mom and I decided to split the Joey Porter \"Bella\" hoagie (steak, portabella mushrooms, swiss cheese and horseradish sauce) and added fried onions, lettuce and tomato to our hoagie. We also ordered onion rings and French fries as well. My dad ordered the Italian hoagie and my boyfriend ordered the New Yorker, which is his favorite.\n\nMy mom and I really enjoyed our hoagie, although we did find there to be a lot of bread on the sandwich. The bread was fresh and delicious, but made the sandwich extremely filling. The horseradish sauce on the sandwich was delicious and not very spicy. The onion rings were fresh and yummy and the fries were fresh cut! My mom and dad were first timers and really enjoyed their food. \n\nOne important thing to mention- the service was amazing. The man who took the orders was very patient with my family, while we tried to figure out what we wanted. He gave us helpful suggestions and was overall very friendly. At the end of our meal, he thanked us for stopping in, which was really nice.\n\nOverall, I am not as obsessed with Peppi's as my boyfriend is, but I definitely enjoy their food.

The hotel itself is still beautiful and the food is above average.  All solid four stars.  I was a bit disappointed initially with some of the pre-arrangements.  In the past I was able to have a complimentary room and the fee waived for the coat check girl.  Friday night because the party was a bit smaller than the last they only discounted the room and charged full fee for coat check/ carving station/ etc.  Now, with that being said the service was over the top 5+++ stars from start to finish.  I get there and am running a bit late. I ask the bellboy Eric how long for a shoe shine, he states its pretty much an overnight service.  I tell him I'm in a rush.  He runs downstairs and shines them himself, done in 30 minutes.  While I'm waiting my contact for the night Ryan Hunt sends up a cheese dish with a bottle of above average wine.  The party goes off without a hitch, great staff, good food, some discounted wines and good premium open bar.  After the hotel party we are walking outside and run into Eric (bellboy) again ask for directions to other club, instead of giving them to us he walks us to the club.  One of the girls wanted cigarettes and instead of directing her to the store.  He ran down and bought them for her and brought them back.  Btw, did I mention he was done working for the night and just did this off the clock.  The next morning I get a ring around 11 am in the hotel room and its the bellboy bringing up aspirin and bottled water from a long night prior.  Everything about this place is three to four stars.  My main pet peeves are the valet cost ($17 and $25 overnight).  There lack of flexibility in food/bev minimums, but the service is over the top great or at least my contacts were over the top great with service.  You can't go wrong in Pittsburgh for an event at this spot.", "type": "review", "business_id": "A38wziZJdYoijhC5S6uWCQ"}

Where is the large flat panel HD screens with HD programming?\n- TV service is satellite based. Lots of interference and loss of signal during my stay due to thunderstorms.

It took about 6 hours for the room to cool off. Once it cooled off though - it was fine.\n\nPros\n- Beds were comfy - still not as firm as I would prefer - but better than some of the places I've stayed recently.\n- Pillows were substantial.

During my stay, I was expecting a FedEx delivery; when I checked the tracking number online to see where my package was, I discovered the hotel had rejected the package. Calls to the Fedex and then to the front desk and the package's sender were made and several hours later, the doorman arrived with the package. Oops - I guess it is a good idea to check before simply rejecting a delivery. To the hotel's credit, the manager did call and offer to send up an amenity or bottle of champagne for the mix-up and the delay of my departure by several hours. I thanked her but declined; several minutes later, hotel security was banging on the door asking me why I had not vacated the room.

Easy walk across the bridge and along the river straight to the field (just under a mile).  The area of the hotel felt very safe and we walked everywhere in the evenings with no issue.  Great service and the rooms are very nice, we requested a high floor with a corner room that was extremely spacious and provided amazing views of the rivers and stadiums.  We flew in for the weekend and with the location of the hotel, had no need for a rental car, walked everywhere.  The Port Authority runs a bus from the airport for $3.75 that drops off a block and a half from the hotel, we took it on the way to the hotel but opted for a cab on the way back because the bus gets packed and it was a pain with luggage.  Cab is about $40 each way but much less hassle.

Not knowing much about Pittsburgh I read some reviews and settled in on the Renaissance for this special weekend...and was not disappointed. \n\nThe focus of our trip was a Cirque Du Soleil show at the Petersen Complex but I wanted to be central to everything so we could explore the town. The Renaissance is well located downtown. It is a short walk to Market Square, the Cultural District, PNC Park, Heinz Field and the light rail which take you to Station Square and the inclines. \n\nThe architecture of the building and lobby really was a draw for me. I love the old turn of the century style with the large arch facing the river. The lobby was a spacious cathedral ceiling-ed area with contemporary styled furnishings. You definitely felt like you were stepping into a hip upscale hotel.\n\nWe were permitted to check in about an hour early without any problem. I had requested extra pillows and a high floor with a river view. Both of these requests were accommodated. We were placed in a huge corner room with incredible view of the North Shore and Allegheny River. If it were baseball season, I could've watched a Pirates game from the room. \n\nThe room was what I would expect out of a 4 star hotel. The bed and pillows were perhaps the most comfortable I've ever slept in...and I usually prefer a firm bed. The bed was just soft enough while still being firm. The linens were soft and inviting. The bathroom amenities were Aveda and high quality. The shower had good strong water pressure. We were provided a K Cup like coffee machine in room and an iPod dock. Being that we were in a corner room, there were windows all around so light poured in. However there were curtains provided to block out enough sunlight and prevent prying eyes. Free wifi that was actually quite fast was a huge plus. There is a mini bar in the room which we did not use but seemed relatively reasonable...for a hotel mini bar. There is a convenience store across the street and a drug store and liquor store a block over so no need to frequent the mini bar unless you plan poorly. \n\nI did not eat or drink at the hotel however I was very tempted. The bar downstairs, the Braddock, has an incredible bourbon and scotch selection, as well as a well rounded menu. There were tons of a places to eat nearby so we wandered the area. There is a Primanti's within a 5 minute walk in Market Square as well as number of ethnic eateries on the same block as the hotel. The area surrounding the hotel is very walkable, however be warned that outside of the restaurants, everything in downtown Pittsburgh is closed by 9pm. \n\nWe parked our car across the street at the public garage and left it there in favor of cabs. We parked from about 1pm on Friday until 2pm Sunday for less than $20. The staff was helpful whenever we needed them. My wife had a cold and ran through a box of tissues every 12 hours. The staff provided extra boxes for us. Housekeeping was efficient and seamless. There was always a doorman out front and was happy to direct us accordingly or find us a cab if needed. Another small thing I noticed was that the elevators were lightning quick. Even on the 9th floor we never had to wait more than a minute for one. \n\nOverall I was very pleased with my stay at the Renaissance. The hotel and staff really helped make my wife's birthday weekend special by providing great service and accommodating all of our requests. This was my first trip to Pittsburgh and likely not my last so I will be returning to and recommending the Renaissance Pittsburgh.", "type": "review", "business_id": "A38wziZJdYoijhC5S6uWCQ"}

The staff is friendly and super quick. The hotel rooms have high ceilings, really comfortable beds and furniture. Flat screen TV and good choice of channel selections.

It is super convenient and won't break your budget. \n\nOverall I was really happy with my stay, I did get a good deal from Priceline and that made it worth even more since I got a discounted rate. 200+ for a room is a bit much for me but for a 4 star hotel its reasonable.

First there is free Internet at the hotel which is a great for hotel guest. Not only that its free computer use in the business center and printing is free. I emailed a 3 page document to myself so that I could print it. I was SHOCKED when the front desk staff told me the computer usage and printing was free. Most hotels charge $5/minute for computer usage and $1/per page. So having a free service like this for hotel guest........AWESOME!!!!\n\nOverall, it's a great hotel, absolute beautiful lobby and bar area.

The lobby vaults several stories to a Brobdingnagian fuchsia light fixture and is flanked by the elevator bay and a grand split staircase.  Marble columns stand sentry over banks of lounge furniture and a modest, tucked away bar.\n\nCheck-in was a breeze, and service remained friendly and efficient throughout our stay.  We requested a room on the top floor and were ecstatic to pull back the curtains to reveal amazing views overlooking the Allegheny, PNC Park and Heinz Field, with a direct sightline to Point State Park and the convergence of the three rivers.

We already had dinner reservations and show tickets, we just had to find a hotel room. The Renaissance Hotel is literally next door to the Byham Theatre where we had show tickets. I walked in and there was a wedding on the iconic stairs in the foyer! It was so beautiful with guests not only seated on the lobby space but also in the balconies on the second floor. I came in just as the ceremony was finishing. and when they were pronounced husband and wife, those in the balcony threw flower petals upon the couple. The hotel handled those like myself who were not part of the wedding very professionally so the ceremony would not be disturbed, but still service incoming guests. \n\nCheck in was very swift as my husband went to the restaurant to meet our dinner reservation while I checked into the hotel. I was able to take the luggage to the room and return to the restaurant a couple blocks away without even being late. I really liked the makeup mirror since I have to take off my glasses to apply my makeup.\n\nWe had dinner and enjoyed our show. We got out of the show and went to the bar for a late night bite and a drink. We got there at 10:45pm and waited and waited. At 11:04, a blonde waitress finally came to our table after delivering food to another table. We asked to see a menu, but was informed that the kitchen had closed at 11pm. We finished the drinks we had ordered, but had to pay the bartender because the waitress had left for the night. The bartender was a gentleman as I had two bills stuck together when I paid him and he found us outside to return the other one. We had to go across the street to another establishment to get something to eat.\n\nOther than the snafu in the bar, all the staff from check in to check out were very nice and professional. The room was very clean and comfortable. As the need comes up, I will probably choose this hotel when I need to stay Downtown again. It is so close to PNC Park across the Clemente Bridge and it is in the heart of the Cultural District, so all the theaters are very close by. It is also close to public transit so you can get anywhere in Pittsburgh from that spot without having to go too far.", "type": "review", "business_id": "A38wziZJdYoijhC5S6uWCQ"}

The Renaissance is a beautiful hotel in an ideal location of Pittsburg. I was in hotel heaven when I walked into the lobby. It looked expensive and well taken care of. The customer service at check in was spot on. Laura (Lori?) was incredibly friendly and seemed genuinely happy we had chosen the Renaissance for our stay. She saw we booked our hotel through Priceline, and that didn't even affect her demeanor. She asked us a few questions about why we were in town and made me feel like I picked the right place to stay at. She then informed my husband and me that she happened to have a complimentary upgrade to a corner junior suite available. I didn't even ask, which is what made this even more wonderful. She confidently told us that we would love the room. \n\nWow! That room was insanely amazing. Laura was right! Panoramic views of the city, river, bridges and two stadiums. I felt so special having this upgrade and couldn't have asked for a better room. It was great watching the sunset with the option of looking out of any of the 7 windows in the room. The room d\u00e9cor was classy, modern and the bed was super comfy. I made sure to let Laura know that this really exceeded our expectations. \n\nThe reason my experience wasn't five stars was because of the room service. Ever since I was little, I have loved to order room service. It's just something I have to do. My first call in to room service was for a bottle of wine. I was quoted a 30 minute wait, which was reasonable to me. It took about 20 minutes, which I was pleased about. I signed my bill and added my tip. When the gentleman left, I was looking over my bill and thought it seemed really high. I completely didn't realize that a 20% gratuity was already included on top of the room service fee. I had tipped him $5 already, so he made out with $10 in tips. I felt really silly after that and tried to justify in my head why spending $43 on a $27 order was okay. My husband made me feel better by saying it is vacation, don't stress about it. \n\nThe next morning I really was craving a croissant and a beverage. I asked if they had croissants a la carte, which they did. The gal said she could have my order in 15 minutes, but probably less. Wow, that's great, I thought. However, don't overpromise and under deliver. If you are going to claim it will be 15 minutes or less, then I am expecting that. After 30 minutes of waiting, I finally called only to hear the lady tell me my food was on the way. When it arrived, it was the saddest looking croissants I've ever seen. They gave me two mini, stale croissants. I took a picture and couldn't stop laughing about how tiny they were. They obviously were not fresh either.", "type": "review", "business_id": "A38wziZJdYoijhC5S6uWCQ"}

Seems like a hotel of a bygone era.\n\nBut...\n\nValet is a mess.  Located on a two lane street with no pull-off, one must be lucky or patient to be able to pull up to the curb.  We came in on a busy Friday, but I knew it would be busy (it's a summer weekend) so why are there not more valets?\n\nAs I returned both Friday and Saturday.  I had to park the car, exit and stand there, waiting for someone to take my keys.   Friday it was about five minutes. I had to make sure I locked it myself, since the valet simply came and took my keys and stuck them on the rack.  I had to point my car to him.  Didn't really trust what was happening among the chaos.  \n\n\nSaturday upon return.  There was no valet in sight.  I parked, exited, waited.. and waited and waited.  Finally a guy comes running across the street and nearly snatched the keys from my hand, as if I was keeping HIM from taking MY keys.  \n\nCheck-in: I mingled in with a wedding party and other weekenders.  Again, a busy weekend (summer weekend and a wedding and Pirates in town) yet only two desks are working for check-in (the third was off with the wedding planner).  Took about 15 minutes to get to the desk and two minute check-in.   I understand the big wedding, but we're paying guests, too.\n\nThe room was huge.  King bed, nice sized bathroom.  But very very cold.  No matter the setting, it remained freezing.\n\nIf you request a river view be prepared and forewarned.  We were neither.  River view means stadium view and with a game going on, means lights, noise from departing crowed and that loud obnoxious so-called music from the plastic bucket-banging guy, the pirate Santa and some other keyboard playing dude, all trying to get a few bucks from the departing crowd... until well after 11 PM.\n\nYes, for some 11 is not late.  However, we rise with the sun for work during the week, so we do the same all weekend.  \n\nDid I mention the noise from the ballroom right below us?  Party Friday night, wedding reception Saturday night.  At least Friday, the noise abated about 9 PM.  Saturday it's 10:32 and the party still thumping right below us.  (picture that annoying bass thumping car that you drive by, but instead it cruises right with you ... all night.)\nCouldn't really enjoy watching a movie, reading has been a challenge.\n\nCalled desk manager who said the party was supposed to have ended at 10 P.M. and he was going to check on it.  Thirty minutes later, nothing.  He said he'd \"adjust our rate.\"  He said he didn't understand our room placement and blamed \"being busy\" as a reason we were stuck in this room.  \n\nI understand there's an expected level of noise and light in a city, but had there been any indication of such, I'd have been sure to request a room on a higher floor and away from the river.  No notes on the room selection and not even a mention at check-in.  I guess being sold out, some guests get screwed.  Of course, by the time we figure it out, we can't request another room since we're in bed already and the hotel seems sold out soooo....\n\nOh that wedding?  In the main lobby Saturday afternoon.  So that beautiful lobby that might have been a joy to sit in and read and enjoy a coffee?  Off limits.  \n\nMostly, I\"m annoyed by room selection.  A peaceful relaxing stay it isn't.    For the rate we are paying, I expected a much more comfortable and relaxing stay.  \n\nI will not stay here again. \n\nBeware and be warned.\n\nUpdate 8/29/15:  the reception ended at 11 P.M.  Night manager adjusted our rate and comped a day of valet.  Acceptable, but won't risk those issues again at the rate they charge", "type": "review", "business_id": "A38wziZJdYoijhC5S6uWCQ"}

I brought my husband here for an early Christmas gift to see the Raiders @ Steelers football game (he likes the Raiders).  We were originally booked at Mansions on Fifth Saturday and later decided to book an extra night Friday so we could have a long weekend in town.  I booked Friday for the Renaissance.  Luckily for us, we had a mixup with the booking when we booked through a third party at the Mansions on Fifth for that Saturday and Booking.com ended up coming through with the win by helping us get booked for Friday night as well at Renaissance in a very nice room!  So we ended up staying at the same hotel both nights and it was just a few blocks from the Heinz field.  Both rooms we stayed in that weekend were beautiful, had large windows, and views of the river and baseball field.  The second night's room was definitely much larger, more windows (on two sides of the room since we were on a corner) and had an AHHHH-MAZING view of the river, baseball stadium, and football stadium.  Honestly, the rooms and decor in the hotel (including the marble lobby) really made this hotel stand out.  The service was great too.  We didn't end up getting room service since we wanted to try out restaurants in town but the service at the front desk was great.  I could not recommend this hotel more if you are staying in Pittsburgh, whether for a sports event or a show (there were so many theatres in that area including one attached to the hotel).  We listened to other reviewers and didn't do valet.  I called the hotel a week before asking about parking and they told me about the much cheaper city parking garage literally across the street from the hotel entrance, so we did that.  It was very cheap and we never used the car while staying there so that helped.  We walked to the strip district (also a mile away) to eat and there are a ton of restaurants nearby, including in the market.", "type": "review", "business_id": "A38wziZJdYoijhC5S6uWCQ"}

There is a large glass walk way over the main convention floor which makes for great people-watching or trying to track down somebody on the floor (hope they're wearing something bright!).\n\nI especially liked how the lighting would adjust based on how much natural light was being let in from the roof windows.  On a bright day, the convention center doesn't use artificial lights.  But when it gets too cloudy, the lights kick in.  So if half the floor is sunny and the other half isn't, only half of the lights come on.  Hardly noticable, but absolutely appreciated.\n\nBus loading/unloading area is very convenient - especially in a city that gets weather as cold as Pittsburgh.  (you don't want to be out in that cold breeze for long!)\n\nI also liked having a walkway directly connecting to the Westin.  Very convenient to not have to go outside to get to the conference.  There's also a decent restaurant, The Original Fish Market, attached to the hotel for those meals that aren't provided by your conference.\n\nThe one annoying thing I did notice was elevator service.  Very slow.  We walked over from the 2nd floor of the westin, had to take the elevator up one floor, walk across the glass bridge, and then go down the escalator to get to the main floor.  Kind of a backwards way of doing it...Plus, one of the 2 elevators from the 2nd floor sky bridge broke down for part of a day, which made handling the crowds from the conference pretty tough.  And for some reason they wouldn't let us walk the 1 flight of stairs down to the Sky Bridge.\n\nBut all in all, a very pleasant experience.  If you're looking for a good place to have a conference, I'd recommend taking a look at Pittsburgh.", "type": "review", "business_id": "z4cguIVh7jL9tTPf5EqRcA"}

However, there are some good things to be said about this one. First is the enclosed walkway between the Westin and the Convention Center. If you're staying at the Westin, this walkway is great for a rainy day or if you don't wish to go out into a hot, humid outdoors. In the convention center, the corridors and halls are spacious. There are quite a number of well-maintained restrooms. On one side of the convention center, the balcony overlooking the Allegheny River offers a great view and a chance to get some air.\n\nDownsides: The connection between the Westin walkway and the convention center is a slow elevator, which you have to take one level up/down. This problem could've been solved by having the walkway be one level higher from the 3rd floor of the Westin. Parking is expensive in this area.

It's also convenient to several of the downtown hotels, such as the Westin, Renaissance, and Hotel Monaco, as well as many restaurants along nearby Penn Ave.\n\nOverall, I had an enjoyable time as a guest at the convention center for ISEF, and am happy that I finally received the opportunity to see the interior.  I hope to return for another event to check it out again soon!", "type": "review", "business_id": "z4cguIVh7jL9tTPf5EqRcA"}

Granted, November is still usually a little early for snow, but looking at the weather forecast a week before the conference and seeing at least 3 days of snow did not exactly make my day!\n\nBooking my stay at the Westin Convention Center however, made things SO much easier.  They've got a covered sky-bridge directly connecting to the convention center from the 2nd floor.  No need to even put on a heavy jacket to go to your conference.  Everyone else is coming from around the city and bundled up and then has to carry their coats around all day (or check them if the conference is well staffed enough to offer this).  But being connected to the Convention Center I could just stroll across the bridge and right into my sessions.\n\nRooms were well appointed.  Beds were comfortable and the double showerheads were fantastic!  Toiletries were a little sparse.  ABSOLUTELY loved the free wi-fi.  So many full service hotels are charging for this these days and it is a HUGE pet peeve of mine to pay for a more expensive hotel and then to pay for Internet access on top of that.\n\nMy issue with my hotel room (don't know if it is true for all) was noise.  I was close to the elevator, but the door seemed particularly thin as I often heard people walking back and forth down the hall and talking.  I was also able to hear various building noises like running water, etc.  The walls between rooms seemed to be thick enough because I didn't hear other people talking or their TVs (or maybe there just weren't people staying in the rooms to either side).\n\nI enjoyed their room service breakfast menu.  They had a nice offering of healthy alternatives including granola, fresh fruit, yogurt, etc.  Delivery times were pretty spot on and the attendants were friendly and efficient.\n\nAnother big plus for the hotel is that it is connected to the Original Fish Market.  Good sushi, GREAT clam chowder and some other delicious fare.  There's access into the restaurant from the hotel's lobby and it is open until 1am for those late arriving West Coast travelers.", "type": "review", "business_id": "bWWrrsPWuoHuAGUCgH8Tyg"}

Close to all major attractions and never more than a couple blocks or a short cab ride away.  The green program was a first for me.  It was a little annoying in that the light in the bathroom kept turning off because I kept forgetting to stick my key card in the light switch.  The funniest aspect of their \"green\" program was the dual shower heads. There is a sign in the shower that reads something along the lines of \"we have provided two shower heads for your comfort. However one remains off to save water unless you turn it on.\"  Now... I don't know about you but I feel if they are trying to achieve some level of green why even bother to put an extra shower head in?  Not to mention if there is a second shower head available to use, I'm certainly not going to pass on it in order to save some water. I know it's not very supportive of going green but come on! \nThe next time I'm in the burgh, the Westin is where I'm staying.

I get it...if you dont change the sheets you save on water, detergent, labor, $, $, $, $$$$$......\n\nI'm not an idiot. I know all this 'environmental' garbage is a bunch of moneymaking ideas dreamt up by some suits. Some are laudable like requiring a keycard to turn the lights on, but get real...they're offering people $5 off their next visit if they don't have their bed remade between nights. This is a hotel....why not suggest saving me $5 if you padlock the bathroom door? About as logical. Hotels = Bed with fresh sheets every night.  By the way, they obviously discontinued the minibar fridge because the power goes out when you leave the room. So why not take the fridges out of the room? Very amateurish to leave them sitting in rooms.\n\nThe hot tub/pool facilities are the kind where you have to sign in, show your key, and walk all the way through the locker rooms before you can enter the pool area that looks like it's a Mexican hotel in the 80's. Not the greatest. I don't care to look at old man ass on my way to the hot tub.\n\nThe location is good for catching a game downtown or for a night on the town.

And unlikely to be that significant relative to bigger decisions like using energy-efficient machines to wash the sheets, having quality insulation to save on heating and cooling, and so on.  Maybe the Westin does these things too, I don't know, but it seemed like the little annoyances in the room were more of a marketing gimmick than a substantive step.

I had their brunch twice during my stay and then had all sorts of complications with using my debit card. There were charges that were just incorrect on the bill which took me a couple of days and couple of phonecalls to different departments within the hotel to clear up. That was really inconvenient and a hard way to leave after having a pretty nice stay other than being sick. The staff were all friendly and helpful and the I enjoyed the layout of the room and the double headed shower. \nI took them up on the 'Go Green option\" and took about 1500 starpoints with me because of this!", "type": "review", "business_id": "bWWrrsPWuoHuAGUCgH8Tyg"}

Theres a couple of restaurants and I counted like three lounges after walking round a bit but none that caught my attention.  Teh hotel itself is ok not that super clean like the Aloft hotels.  The hallway carpets were stained and my bathroom was clean but outdated.  At least the bed was comfy and free of bedbugs(I check for that as soon as i enter the room a pet peeve of mine).  It's huge so whenever your trying to talk to someone at check in theres always a line.  Next time I will probably look for its sister hotel Aloft because this seems to be the better out one among the sheraton,westin and Aloft.

Although the hotel was very comfortable and in a good location, we could hear every noise from the hallway and adjacent rooms (including the bathroom). I was sitting up in bed reading, and every time the people next door closed a drawer in their bureau the whole headboard would shake.\n\nParking was also expensive. We needed to use the car several times during our stay, so we had to valet park, which was over $20/day (plus tips each time we picked up or dropped off the car).\n\nThe coffee shop attached to the hotel is just OK. The breakfast/lunch place was not very good. You will probably have to venture a bit to find affordable and good quality food (other than the hotel restaurant, which I can't comment on because we did not eat there given the high prices).\n\nOne perk--the hotel does offer free internet, but it is a low bandwidth version. We didn't need the internet for work or anything so it was hard to justify paying for the high speed, so we used the free version. It gets the job done for email and web browsing, but it does not stream videos well.\n\nThe bed was comfortable and the shower head was very good. I agree with other reviewers that the amenities were not as nice as I have seen in other Westins--no bathrobe, room service menu not as good, staff not quite as helpful. Also, because it is a green hotel, they will be a little stingy about replenishing your towels and toiletries. If you have a lot of people in your room or for some other reason require extra supplies, be sure to request that. We came back after housekeeping to find that they had given us a half-full bottle of shampoo to replace the one we had used. Not sure if they had just gotten that from someone else's room (gross!) or it had just spilled and they didn't want to waste it. They also failed to replace our in-room coffee and tea supply so we had to call and ask for more.\n\nAll in all, we definitely would not pay full price to stay here, but might consider it again if there was another great deal.", "type": "review", "business_id": "bWWrrsPWuoHuAGUCgH8Tyg"}

However, after arriving and seeing the room I was instantly relieved and happy with my decision. The room was clean, the beds were comfortable, and the view was an excellent 25th floor view of the Strip District below. On top of this, the staff were all very kind and courteous, and were more than willing to call cabs for us as well. \n\nMy biggest complaints about the Westin really all surround the bathroom. Although very clean, I was annoyed with the fact that the shower made this crazy noise whenever it was on which sounded like somebody gargling at sonic boom levels. In addition, there seemed to be no fan, which meant if you got a hot shower, you couldn't see anything in the mirror without wiping it off. Lastly, there was no lock! I mean, yeah, we managed without, but it is still reassuring to know that a lock stands between your privacy and three of your friends.\n\nOverall however, I was extremely pleased with my visit and would gladly return to the Westin again if I ever find myself in Pittsburgh.", "type": "review", "business_id": "bWWrrsPWuoHuAGUCgH8Tyg"}

My name is Ben. The name of the Steelers' quarterback (beloved perhaps even more in 2007 than he is today) is also Ben.

I figured she'd just tell me if she happened to have a few suggestions.\n\nSome people, it seems, just like a challenge.\n\nWhen I saw her that evening, Monica had walked up to the Strip District to canvas all the tchotchkie-mongers and tourist traps.

I gave it to my mom.\"\n\nSome people, it seems, just like a challenge.\n\nThat's when Monica called up her friend's mom out of the blue and asked if she still had the sign, and whether it had any sentimental value. No, it doesn't, why do you ask? Well, you see, a guest at my hotel asked if I...\n\nNext time I saw Monica, she had (after finishing her shift at the most popular convention hotel in the city) driven across town to the house of a friend's mom to retrieve the precious artifact.\n\nHere's a photo of her handing it to me. http://j.mp/BenAtWork\n\nAnd when I offered to pay her what she had once paid at the store, she wouldn't take a dime.\n\nAnd when I offered to pay her for the gas she'd burned driving across town, she wouldn't take a dime.\n\nI assume, based on the letter I wrote to the hotel's general manager and copied to corporate (back in November 2007), that she has since been promoted far higher than the front desk.

The front desk staff seem very helpful, but I have not really had many interactions aside from the check in & out processes. \n\nConnected to the convention center if you're traveling for an event there - can be convenient in the winter months since there's no need to walk outside. \n\nThe gym seems amazing. They now have a program where they'll even lend you workout clothing (there may be a small fee?) and shoes! If you're traveling by plan and have limited packing space this could be a life saver!\n\nOne thing that really burns me is the internet. It's \"free\" but when you log in, you'll see there are actually 4 or 5 different options. I have a feeling that if you're not paying you're getting lower bandwidth. Annoying. Would do 3.5 stars if I could.", "type": "review", "business_id": "bWWrrsPWuoHuAGUCgH8Tyg"}

We booked the hotel at a great rate on Hotwire.  Knowing fully well what we were getting ourselves into by perusing their website (what's in the neighborhood, price of parking, restaurants in the hotel, amenities, etc.), we were a little bit afraid that since the hotel was next to the convention center, that perhaps the hotel stay would feel too \"corporate.\"\n\nBut, this was not the case at all.  We felt so at home in this room.  We were on a high level floor (Starwood Preferred), and our large hotel window overlooked the rivers and the ballparks.  We even got to see fireworks the night we arrived!  I had called ahead to let the hotel know that my husband and I also were coincidentally celebrating our anniversary that weekend, so we were welcomed by a complimentary bottle of champagne and a plate of chocolate covered strawberries.  SOOO delicious, and SO good after a long day of flying across country.\n\nThe hotel charges $24/night for valet, which was worth it.  Self-parking is only a few dollars cheaper every night, but it really saved the long haul of luggage and having to walk with tired feet coming home late every night.  And the valet crew was outstanding.\n\nAnother perk is that there are two restaurants in the hotel.  One of them closes late every night, so there was no lack of food or drink any minute of our stay.  The additional bonus is that Downtown Pittsburgh is pretty hopping and busy, and being so close to many great restaurants and theaters, there is no shortage to all the fun and interesting things within walking distance of the Westin.\n\nAnd, to me, the best thing of all of the bed!  It was one of the best beds I have EVER slept in, and I unusually was able to get right to sleep once in bed, and I stayed asleep.  Oh, man, I'm still dreaming about it!\n\nIn the end, loved the hotel.  Would stay in again if the rate was right.", "type": "review", "business_id": "bWWrrsPWuoHuAGUCgH8Tyg"}

Anyway, it was $5 and we didn't have a problem walking 5 minutes to/from the car. \n\nCheck in was easy, and the lady at the desk had some great suggestions as to where to buy some Steeler gear.\n\nThe very best thing about the room - the king size bed. Amazing. It was probably the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in. The memory foam pillow top really made it incredible. We have an old double bed at home, so I'm probably a little biased.\n\nThe room had an energy saving option by placing the room key in a slot in the wall. We never tried it, so if you don't like it at least know that you don't HAVE to use it.\n\nThe shower had a neat dual-head feature. It would hit your head and straight on your back if you wanted.

I was in town attending a conference at the convention center so along with how great everything looked, you couldn't beat the location. \n\nHowever, I had the absolute worst hotel experience at the Pittsburgh Westin. I am a Starwood Preferred Guest member and up until now have had great experiences, but this one was so bad it really makes me question the integrity of the brand and I am hesitant to stay at another Starwood establishment. \n\nEven tonight as I try to log into my SPG to see if my points for being \"conservative\" with the room were updated, I can't logon to the site as \"The system is temporarily unavailable.\" I should also note I have photographs of everything, because I couldn't believe how bad the stay was. \n\n1. The terrible experience happened before I even arrived. When I googled the hotel, accusations of bed bugs appeared on both Yelp.com and Bedbegregistry.com - and the hotel had yet to take the time to respond. A simple detail that if someone was paying attention they would be able to resolve. \n\n2. I arrived at the hotel after a 7+ hour drive only to find out that the bathroom in my hotel room was broken. After two calls to Guest Services, about 30 minutes later a maintenance man came by, and it took him about 15 minutes to fix it. So a total of 45 minutes before I could use the rest room after arriving. I had suggested to Guest Services on the second call that they move me to a new room and it was awkwardly laughed off. \n\n3. After using the restroom (finally!) I noticed the tub was dirty and there was mold on the top of the shower by the rod and on top and inside the mini-fridge. The mold was \"new\" so it could have easily been wiped off and taken care of if the room was being properly clean and attention to detail was paid. The fact that the hotel lacked the ability for such simple house keeping was surprising. \n\n4. The paint in various places of the room was chipping and some of the furniture, most notably the side table were knicked and scratched badly. \n\n5. Because of the bed bug reviews, I stripped the sheets to look for evidence. I did not find any, but did become aware of many brown and black tar stains on the sheets that were tucked in to the mattress. \n\n6. I begrudgingly ordered room service because of how late it was by the time I got settled. I ordered the Turkey BLT with lemon aioli and arugula salad. Instead I got cold, what-seemed-like-day-old deli meat, burnt bacon with a thin, thin layer of mayo, not aioli. The arugula salad did not have 1 piece of arugula - it was mixed greens with shredded carrots instead. When you read the description and look at what I actually received, it is very, very disappointing. \n\n7. The coffee pot in my room leaked all off, wetting the sugar, napkins, etc. \n\n8. They charged the wrong credit card after both myself and my office manager telling several different people which card to charge. I had booked the room on a corporate card, and my office manager had believed she straightened everything out at the front desk that they were to charge the card on file because I would not have the corporate card with me. The first thing I was asked by the front desk was for a credit card. After I explained the situation to the front desk, they insisted that the card on file would be charged and they just needed my card for \"incidentals\" - after back and fourth I gave in and gave them my card, assured it would not be charged. Then when I checked out two days later, I once again confirmed that they would charge the card on file and they still charged the wrong one.  Fast forward to the following week when I notice the charges, I called the billing department and someone has still yet to return my call. I am being charged interest on this card for their mistake. \n\nThis was an absolute terrible experience and I am very disappointed at the Westin and Starwood Hotels for their obvious lack of pride and detail with this hotel.", "type": "review", "business_id": "bWWrrsPWuoHuAGUCgH8Tyg"}

The hotel was very nice all around.  Efficient , friendly staff and genuinely hospitable.  The rooms were in good condition and well-maintained.  \n\nSo were looking forward to returning for a woodworking symposium at the Lawrence Convention Center.\n\nI'd say lots was the same but some of the changes were irritating and so to be fair, the negatives first (ending on a high note).\n\nFor the game, a room. For this time, we had a King suite.  19th floor.  View okay but not great as advertised but hey, you're not there to sit in the hotel all day, right? :-)\n\nWell I had booked a corner suite but there was a bit of an issue with my profile on SPG and so they were \"de-feathering\" the room and it was taking forever. So I said, another corner suite was fine.  Except it wasn't.  It was a suite alright, but in the living area where one would expect a sofa, sitting area and TV, etc?  There sat a 4 top dining table with a hole in the middle. Turns out that lots of business travelers like this arrangement for meetings and all the suites below the 11th floor have this.  \n\nSO LOOK OUT before you book, people!  :-)\n\nBut seriously it wasn't a huge deal as they were more than happy to move me. And they did - to a complimentary upgrade King Suite that you could a tech startup in.  Very spacious, with dual closets, very nice sitting area with couch and two comfy chairs, two huge picture windows about the size of patio sliders.  A vanity area outside the (smallish) bathroom.\n\nAbout that bathroom. A couple things bug me when I travel.  One, is that some downtown hotels don't have a fan/vent in the bathroom, and so the mirror fogs up big time.  Not a huge deal and I use the hair dryer so I can see, but really? can't they do something?\n\nThe other thing is this:  I hate rain shower heads. I'm an old dude, I like my water pressure, not a rain forest gently wafting over me. I want velocity!  Hit me with that H20!  And yes, I know that we need to conserve water, but I have a seriously great low flow shower head at home and it cost 20 bucks on Amazon.  Sheesh!\n\nAnother gripe:  There were exactly two places to recharge a device in the entire suite, and both were at a side table about 12 feet from the bed (and only halfway across the room)!\n\nNow, between us we have 5 devices to charge including phones. I use mine for my alarm and like it right there.  So really, can't we have a retrofit so grown folk can charge their whatsits?\n\n\nFinally, the elevators. What?  How can that be an issue? Well, since our last visit, they installed a software/hardware package that eliminates the buttons inside the elevator. Instead, there is a touch screen at each floor.  One selects the destination, and the screen lights up with a large number telling you which elevator. \n\nWhich SUCKS.  I'm sure they're using some kind of load-management software to optimize elevator use, and I'm sure that the goal is more efficient utilization and less latency.  Well it ain't makin' it.  You wait and wait and wait.  Then sometimes - if you're like me - you forget which elevator you were supposed to take.\n\nI did find that, it seems that if you go press all the screens with your floor and perhaps those above, the software sensed increased demand and sent an elevator quicker.  Hacking an elevator. Who'd a thought it?\n\nNow to the good:\n\nThe staff were super friendly, warm and helpful.  So when I asked, they found a power strip and a 25' orange extension cord and I ran it over to the bed along the wall.  Sort of the Clampetts come to city with my cord running all over the room. Nonetheless, we had power to our devices.\n\nThe room was otherwise nice and quiet.  Did I mention that it was large? \n\nThe hotel restaurants are good. Penn Grille is more relaxed overall and Bill's is more of a \"joint\" but the burgers are great, as are the nachos.  The service in both is excellent and the staff are unfailingly friendly - really hospitable the way we mean it here in the south.\n\nThe hotel is attached to the Lawrence Convention Center, which was nice as it rained some each day. We made it to the various events high and dry.\n\nI would say that the high point of the hotel is without question the attentiveness, courtesy and genuine friendliness of the hotel staff.  Not that fake, I'm polite but really looking down on you courtesy that we've experienced at the Ritz in Chicago (which I reviewed last year).\n\nIn fact, if this hotel was sited next to the Ritz, and the price was the same, I'd choose the Westin, hands down. And given that the rooms were less than half that of the Ritz, that's a good indicator of how well we were treated. \n\nMy wife tipped the housekeeping lady $300 because she was so nice. What else can I tell you?  Stay there.\n\nAnd Pittsburgh, you are an awesome town. Good people, beautiful views, and a good nightlife too.", "type": "review", "business_id": "bWWrrsPWuoHuAGUCgH8Tyg"}

You are not \"stuck\" using just a rain water shower head. You do have the option to switch to the regular shower head with the twist of the hand. Wow, is that hard to do?\n\nThe elevators do have a keypad system that tells you which elevator to use. The longest wait we had was about 15 seconds....and there was a convention going on next door at the convention center. And no, we did not \"forget\" which elevator to get on. Maybe the reviewer should be a bit less self absorbed, get his head away from his phone and pay attention to what's going on around him. Not that difficult folks.\n\nNow that I debunked those two non issues from a previous reviewer, I can tell you we enjoy the amenities the Westin has to offer.

I'd heard they were reputed to have the best fish sandwich in the city, so that's what I was looking for. \n\n(By the way, as a side-note to the people, on Yelp and elsewhere, who whine about how a restaurant with the word \"Oyster\" in its name should focus on gourmet oysters and not fish sandwiches: Jesus, grow up. I don't go to Red Robin because I'm in the mood for some robin carpaccio, and I don't go to the Silk Elephant because I'm in the mood for some broiled pachyderms. A name is just a name. This is a very old establishment, and if you didn't do your homework going in to know what's good to order nowadays, then the fault is wholly yours, and I have zero sympathy. To quote a wise Russian: CRY SOME MORE.)\n\nAnyway, back to the sandwich:\n\nI got a platter with fries, slaw, and the sandwich. Sounds very pedestrian, sure, but it was far from ordinary. The slaw was very substantial and was dressed well without being overwhelming. The fries were extremely fresh, had a lot of substance to them, and were satisfyingly crispy. The fish sandwich itself- heck, I can hardly write about it, because I couldn't help but to inhale it. It was the best fish sandwich I can recall ever having eaten, and I could hardly stop myself from wolfing it down, bite after intoxicating bite. It's something you really just need to experience for yourself.\n\nI ate at the bar, and your usual condiments (ketchup, tartar sauce, salt, pepper, etc) were easily at hand. I used a moderate dollop of tartar sauce on my sandwich, which was great, but I'm sure the sandwich would have stood up fine without it, too. A lot of places' fish sandwiches are extremely bland and dry, making the tartar sauce necessary just to swallow it down, but the OOH's sandwich needs no such crutch. The tartar sauce is able to do what it's really meant to do: complement an already-excellent fish dish\n\nSo, what else can I say? I feel like my life as a Pittsburgher is enriched just knowing that this place exists, and I can't believe I've been missing out as long as I have been. I'm a graduate student at Pitt, and I can guarantee that whenever I have a solid hour free for lunch, I'll hop a bus downtown to get another fish sandwich platter.

One thing I am starting to notice about this area, it seems acceptable to have curt or even rude service. I suppose I was jaded before.\n\nOk, the food itself. The side of coleslaw was rather good. It tasted fresh and creamy! The crabcake...(can I call it that?) was more like a clump of Stove Top Stuffing and a tiny bit of crab meat. The two jumbo fried shrimp were ok.

Honestly, I was a bit underwhelmed.  As you walk in, it comes across as a bit of a small, a little bit dingy, diner.  I have no problem with that, I happen to love diners, but it's not what I would expect from a place I am hoping to get good seafood.  The selection for beer with dinner was rather limited (but let's face it we weren't going there for beer, it's just something I noticed)  The service was seriously lacking.  When asking for our order, the waitress was literally on her cell phone.  I could never tell if she was paying attention to us or not.   \n\nI also found the set-up of the restaurant to be rather lacking.  It feels very claustrophobic, and while we were sitting up at the counter, a number of people bumped into me due to the fact that there is very little room to walk around.  \n\nNow, as far as the food goes, nothing was BAD, but it wasn't stellar.  Nothing on the menu seemed to be \"Great\" to me.  I ordered clam strips, and there was absolutely nothing special about them whatsoever.  They are the same clam strips I could get anywhere else I were to ever go.  There was no extra flavoring, no pizazz, nothing.  Just some strips of clam fried up.  Same goes for the french fries.  Now, the green beans I got were of note, because they were really gross.  There was no flavoring added to them whatsoever, they were just plain, boring, soggy green beans.  I was very much let down.\n\nSo all in all, if you are looking for something quick and find yourself downtown, the Original Oyster House is perfectly acceptable.  If you are looking for some place that makes very unique, delicious seafood meals, find something else.", "type": "review", "business_id": "-KQ283hJkBO12u8XOrlCcQ"}

It turns out very few people in Pittsburgh or at least in our office actually knew this restaurant. It's an old, tiny restaurant located in the beautiful Market Square. It's so old school they only take cash! The place is called  \"Original Oyster House\" but ironically they don't serve raw oysters, let alone decent oysters! They only have these mediocre breaded oysters that you can have in your sandwich or by themselves. Everything else is average. There is nothing special about this place except for the fact that it was the \"first restaurant\" in Da Burgh as supported by the front door sign \"historical landmark.\" If you're looking for good oysters, raw or not, or simply a good restaurant for lunch or dinner, this is definitely NOT the place.", "type": "review", "business_id": "-KQ283hJkBO12u8XOrlCcQ"}

We were prepared for foam plates and cash only, which works for a nice lunch outside. Sadly we were disappointed with our meal. Our group of 3 tried the breaded oysters, famous fried fish, beer-battered fish nuggets, and crab cakes with fries and onion rings. Although the portions were generous for being fried, much of the food was soggy due to the excess of grease. We were in an area with a server, but the service was terrible. Our server continually ignored us and frequently forgot items she was supposed to bring to the point that we went inside to get the items ourselves. The food is a good deal if you are willing to overlook the service and like really greasy fried seafood.", "type": "review", "business_id": "-KQ283hJkBO12u8XOrlCcQ"}

Huge piece of fresh cod on a kaisesr roll.  It was the kind where the ends are hanging off the bun.  I can only imagine the size of the massive sandwich!

We were downtown early for a dance lesson and were looking to kill some time eating dinner.  After entering Market Square we looked at our choices and chose the Oyster House after noting its shaded outdoor seating.  With our decision made, we walked into the Oyster House to get some menus.  The inside of the place consists of a large bar on one side and a line of tables on the other side.  Each table already has on it some hot sauce as well as some vinegar with hot peppers soaking in it.  Soon after we entered we asked the bartender if we could sit outside.  She said yes while giving us some menus and letting us know that the closer we sat to the door, the better service we would have.  With that we headed out the door and sat down in the only shady spot further away from the door.  I did notice that there were two different servers waiting on people outside and figure that was what the bartender was referring to.\n\nAfter a little bit longer of a wait than I would have liked (and wishing we were sitting closer to the door), we were waited on and I ended up ordering the titanic platter while my fiance went with the crab cakes.  My titanic platter consisted of the monster fish sandwich and 2 sides for which I chose the Pittsburgh cut ribbon taters and then I upgraded my second one to the New England clam chowder.  After only a short time both of the clam chowders came out of the kitchen.  It ended up being surprisingly good with a nice creaminess to it and what I think was fish in addition to the clams.  My fish sandwich was also pretty good as the two filets had a nicely cooked thin coating that was crunchy.  The Pittsburgh cut ribbon taters were also a slight disappointment as they were merely potato chips.  I guess I probably should have asked about them instead of just ordering them.  Finally I was also able to taste my fiances Maryland style crab cakes which I did not  think were good at all.  There was not a hint of old bay in them and it had a distinct mayonnaise taste to it.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I might be back here in the future.  It's never going to be my fish pick of a restaurant in Market Square but I did really enjoy the fried fish and see myself eating here from time to time.", "type": "review", "business_id": "-KQ283hJkBO12u8XOrlCcQ"}

She showed us all of the pictures of past Miss America pageants that the previous owner went to (a lot!) and told us the history of the place. Women weren't even allowed to eat here 'til the 60s! \n\nThe clam chowder was incredibly rich and salty in the best way. As for the oysters, we ordered the \"lightly\" breaded option, which comes with three fried oysters, but ours came with four as a bonus. The batter was seasoned great, and apparently the same recipe since 1916, but if that's what they mean by \"lightly\" battered, I wonder what their heavy battered option is like. Our oysters had a very thick coating of batter so the oyster taste and texture was a little lost in it. We also had a couple clams with some sandy grit in them :/ The clam chowder was so good and the service was some of the best I've ever had, so it brought what would have been a three star rating from me up to a four.", "type": "review", "business_id": "-KQ283hJkBO12u8XOrlCcQ"}

It doesn't help that the place tends to be pretty empty, at least from what I've observed - a lack of visible patrons definitely can keep people away. But today I decided to give them a shot, because I really didn't want to stop in anywhere for a big meal - I just wanted a cheap piece of pizza.\n\nThough the place does have a \"dive-y\" feel to it, it did look very clean and had a welcoming atmosphere once I ventured on in. The tables and chairs - which were mostly the elevated and interconnected kind - admittedly looked a little worn down, but they weren't gross or anything like that. Since I knew I'd likely be eating in a few hours I opted to just eat a plain piece of cheese pizza to hold me over. One piece of cheese pizza and one bottle of Dr. Pepper to go with it cost me $4.25 - not bad, in my opinion. And while not fancy by any means the pizza was pretty tasty; it had the right blend of cheese and pizza and the sauce was very flavorful. It was exactly what you'd want when enjoying a plain ol' piece of pizza.\n\nI'll definitely keep this place's super quick service, relatively cheap prices and impressive portion sizes in mind from now on - it's good to know that there are places you can get into while downtown like this, and from what I'm hearing/reading it's worth exploring the menu and eating something other than pizza here. I admit, however, that I may get some food to go next time if I can, as the old elevated and connected chairs and tables in here sounded like they wanted to break apart at any moment...maybe it's time to update them. After all, \"Dive-y\" doesn't necessarily have to mean \"falling apart,\" right?", "type": "review", "business_id": "SvoJ3Y3uqDfB4iGUaWXh8Q"}

I have to object strenuously to a few of the drinks on the menu.  First, there is a \"Dark Bomb\"--Guinness and Jagermeister.  Then there is an \"Irish Pancake\"--Guinness and butterscotch schnapps.  And finally there is the \"Irish Hoe\"--half Guinness, half Hoegaarden.  These are crimes against nature.  I can't vouch for the last one, but the first two were terrible (of course I had to try them).  Jagermeister has no business within ten feet of Guinness, and the Pancake would have been okay if they halved the amount of butterscotch.  \n\nThis month's featured beer is Red Stripe--get five bottles for $15.  The pints have some odd prices:  $5.61 for Guinness and Newcastle and $4.68 for Sam Adams.\n\nThey had some live music (a guy with a wee guitar singing eclectic covers) which was decent and ended at 1am.

The fish was fried with the skin on and was so tough we couldn't even break it with a fork. The fair-style fresh cut fries were cold and shriveled and the pretzels (that we received after our food) appeared just be heated frozen pretzels.  Our waitress never refilled our waters (we also had beer) and never returned to our table after the food was dropped off. When we asked for a refill on the water and were deciding on dessert she was short with us and snapped \"just tell me how many waters you want' that made our dessert decision pretty easy.

Daunted by the wait, and bellies hungry for delicious comfort food, my boyfriend I were sullenly driving back toward home when we remembered - isn't there a little Irish bar just off the main drag of the Strip District?  Let's go investigate.\n\nSo investigate we did, I'd say around 730 on a Saturday night.  It was oddly quiet and uncrowded inside - a few tables here and there, but no big groups gathered around to watch a game over drinks, or eat dinner.  There was lots of Irish paraphernalia on the walls, but the harsh lighting and widely spaced tables made the bar feel a bit uninviting.  A little dimness could've gone a long way!  We got some beer on draft - a Harp for me - and started with the fried pickles, which were served with honey mustard.  They were.....fried pickles.  They were served as whole spears, not bite-size pieces, so sometimes the breading would slide off, but they were hot and tasty with the tangy mustard.  Good size appetizer portion.\n\nBoth craving something authentic, my boyfriend got the fish 'n' chips, and I got the corned beef and cabbage.  Both were utterly no frills.  My boyfriend lauded their authenticity, and I have to confess, the fish 'n' chips were spot on.  Especially the fish.  That taste!  It took me back to my semester studying abroad in England, eating fish 'n' chips out of a paper cone.  It didn't need anything fancy or unique to dress it up - it was great as it was.  He was hugely satisfied.\n\nI was underwhelmed with my corned beef and cabbage.  While I won't question the authenticity, the overall effect was that the food was plain.  Well-cooked, and in a good portion, but not really crave-worthy.  There were some vegetables on the side as well, everything prepared with utter simplicity.  I enjoyed the taste, but after a few bites, I wanted something more.  It was a large portion, so I took some home, but we weren't even motivated to reheat it.  It didn't really do it for me.   Apologies to Ireland if that's how this dish was meant to be prepared - if that's the case, I suppose it just wasn't my thing.\n\nWe started to leave just as a few musicians came in.  I think I'd enjoy coming back here for a drink and an appetizer during some live Irish music!  Service was a bit slow, but if I was there to relax and unwind for a few hours, I wouldn't mind at all.", "type": "review", "business_id": "6xEl2PDJulIp1PfWqa7-aA"}

Once was quite a few years ago and the second time was this past weekend. The first time I went, I got fish & chips, and I was so unimpressed that it's the primary reason that I refused to eat there since. BUT this past weekend, my wife ordered the fish & chips and wow...awesome! I would definitely order them going forward. It's a huge piece of fish, though, so be prepared. I'm not sure what changed, but I'm glad it's improved.\n\nI opted for the blackened tilapia sandwich, which was also really good...and larger than I expected. My only complaint was that it seemed like a lot of roll even for the entire filet being on there. The creole mustard/mayo was good, but I used it sparingly. The side of chips (fries) were good and had that typical hand-cut taste.\n\nWe also ordered the mussels for our appetizer and they were really good. The Smithwick's broth was a different take on what we'd usually get our mussels steamed in and was delicious, and the mussels tasted fresh.\n\nOverall, the vibe at the Harp is fun. Their large dining area has a dining hall feeling, which doesn't work for me when it's not busy and you sit down to eat, but it's good for their live music nights (which they have plenty of). I prefer sitting in the smaller bar area. The bartenders are always really nice and there's a nice neighborhood bar feeling when you're up there.\n\nI'd say my only real semi-complaint is their limited whiskey options. If you're there for a Guinness, you're going to be happy, but if you want some whiskey, the limited list of Irish whiskeys may be underwhelming. We were told that they're working on making an actual list and adding to it, and there were some perfectly fine options, but you'll be disappointed if you want something even a little adventurous, like a Connemara or something.\n\nRegardless, it's a nice, laid back option in the Strip, and if you're in the mood for some fish & chips you're really limited to two excellent options in town: Piper's Pub or the Harp & Fiddle.", "type": "review", "business_id": "6xEl2PDJulIp1PfWqa7-aA"}

Overly buttery with instant potatoes, too much cheap chedder cheese, the worst quality greasy ground hamburger and canned crunchy onions (on a Shepard's Pie?).

Traditionally they also have pate, but the ones at My Ngoc don't have it.\n\nUnfortunately, the new owner informed me that Lucy has moved and set up shop in NYC.

By Pittsburgh standards, it's worthy of 4 stars easy.  \n\nOn the other hand, their pho has much room for improvement.  The broth wasn't as savory and flavorful as I've had elsewhere and the noodles were a bit on the tougher side.\n\nA banh mi will run you $5-$6, which is definitely on the pricier side given it's size, but as a niche food in a small market, I'm definitely not complaining if I need my banh mi fix.

The cashiers are always friendly. Be careful though and try all your clothes on, a lot of things have the wrong size tag on them or just run small, I have purchased to different style pants here each a size 3 and they fit all together different.

This proved to have been a massive error in judgement on all our parts.\n\nThe first thing I ordered was a bowl of lemongrass soup.  The listing of ingredients made it seem like it should be tom yum soup, which is one of my favorite soups.  What I received was a bowl of dishwater-colored broth containing tomatoes, so that it tasted like watered-down minestrone, with some chicken submerged in shame at the bottom of the bowl.  A single lonely wilted leaf of cilantro wallowed on top.  No lemongrass was in evidence, but there were plenty of mushrooms.  I stopped eating this when I unearthed an unsightly artifact which turned out to be the bottom of a mushroom stem, with dirt still clinging to it.\n\nMy companions both got chicken and stir-fried vegetables in what turned out to be Singapore curry sauce.  This was passable, but not exciting -- again, although it claimed to be lemongrassy, there was no lemongrass flavor to be had, and the chicken was a bit rubbery and overdone.\n\nI got one of the fish entrees.  On the menu, the description made out like it was covered in a spicy sauce.  It turned out to be more like a not-at-all-spicy soup with bits of orange roughy floating in it.  Again, the broth was lacking in overall flavor, as if they were trying to save on costs by not adding enough spices.  The fish itself was at least not overcooked or dirty, but it was a poor aesthetic decision to bread and fry the piece of fish, then put the breaded coating into soup.  Gross.\n\nTo top it off, the service wasn't that great, and we were actually charged for the dirt-filled soup.  We will not be back.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Lm_mR5xDF91OeZw97ch41g"}

So on this particular foray into a night with Lily Tomlin, we thought we'd try something different.\n\nI see all the growling reviews here complaining about...well...everything...from service to food, and frankly, I'm not quite sure we were all at the same restaurant.\n\nI'm also a bit confused by most people calling it 'Thai' when the menu says 'Cambodian'.\n\nLemon Grass was pleasant.  They did seem to operate with minimal staff, but they certainly seemed to keep up.  There was a small group of diners when we arrived, and that number grew while we were there, seemed like mostly people who were going to the same show we were.\n\nThe menu options were quite ethnic and unusual from things I'd seen on most Asian menus, which to me, was very cool. Couldn't pronounce them, but the ingredients were certainly unlike the others, so we decided to try a couple of dishes we'd never tried before, including an appetizer.\n\nThe appetizers were called 'Na Taings' and were like little non-sweet rice krispie treats that came with a very yummy pork and curry sauce to top them with.  There were five on the plate.  Several of their appetizers came 5 to the plate.  Ok folks, what is UP with the odd numbers on appetizer plates around here lately?  If you're sharing with another person, do we really want to incite a riot over who gets the last one?  Even Stevens is best on any shared plate.  Two for you, two for me, or three for you, three for me...not 'Oh no, you go ahead'  'No, YOU go ahead, really'.\n\nAnyway, the appetizer was quite tasty and hit the spot.\n\nMy friend ordered hot tea, which seemed to come in a magical pot.  The pot was only about two inches tall, and about as round as a very small tortilla, but it filled both of our normal sized cups three times.  It was a beautiful little creation of a pot, I must say. It looked like cast iron, and was very ornamental, and came with its own matching trivet to rest upon.  The tea was a very flavorful jasmine. How six cups managed to fit in that tiny pot is amazing.\n\nFor the entrees, I cannot remember the names of the dishes, nor can I find them listed online. Lemon Grass doesn't seem to have its own website, and all of the menu sites only appear to have a minimalist lunch menu, or something outdated.\n\nMy friend ordered something with many vowels and consonants, that was a seafood-curry-vegetable mix on a bed of 'crispy rice noodles', and I ordered another dish with many vowels and consonants, that was a pork based curry and vegetable (but lower on the veggie count) also over a bed of crispy rice noodles.\n\nAfter the waitress took our order, she came back from the kitchen to inform my friend that the dish she'd ordered was out, so my friend opted for the same as I.\n\nThe dishes arrived.  There was a giant mound of crispy white rice noodles, and they were indeed 'crispy', with a decent sized spot of the actual meat and curry portion nestled against it, with a ginormous decorative flower made of beet (my plate) and carrot (her plate) on a landscaping of parsley.  We switched plates...beets make me gag.  Then the waitress asked if we wanted chopsticks, and well...not so functional for a blind woman, but I opted to use them.\n\nThe dish was unusual and quite delicious - but a CHORE to eat, with either a fork OR chop sticks.  The first bite I tried to take with the chop sticks literally thrust the end of a very rigid rice noodle right up my right nostril.  In my friend's case, even with a fork, rice noodles were flying.  But, all in all, it was quite delicious. It was pork, a curry gravy, some bean sprouts, and fried egg strips.  Honestly, except for the grrrrrr of trying to contain the crispy rice noodles to the plate, it was a tasty and filling meal.  Quite pleasant, and it was nice to try something 'new' to us.\n\nThe bill wasn't outrageous, just under $40 for two entrees, an appetizer, and a pot of tea.\n\nWe both agreed that we'd go back...but next time we'll avoid the 'crispy' noodles for something a bit more malleable like rice or soft noodles.\n\nThe staff was fine and helpful - the food decent.  Heck the only thing that made the evening even slightly unpleasant was the cackling yinzer at one table who apparently thought she was in her own dining room at home.\n\nFor the pre-theater or concert scenario, I do recommend it.  It's worth a shot, especially if you're an 'outside the box' eater.  Try something you can't pronounce...what the heck.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Lm_mR5xDF91OeZw97ch41g"}

It is a low(200) capacity venue catering to the off-center art crowd, and if you identify with that then you have probably already been called here by one of the many shows that it hosts. Shows here can range from 'The-Biggest-Name-You've-Never-Heard-Of\" to simply \"The-Name-You've-Never-Heard-Of\". The art is usually local, and can obviously be hit or miss. The sound and conditions could be better, depending on what show you're seeing. In the summer the place can get unbearably hot, with people running for the exits between sets.\n\nParking on the street is plentiful and free, and while there usually isn't too much within walking distance on a sparsely crowded night, Liberty Avenue is only a few blocks away to grab a bite to eat beforehand. The trip downstairs to the bathroom is somewhat disturbing. The toilet, appropriately, also lies at the end of a long hallway, behind a door which may or may not be able to close completely. Cleanliness of this one was an afterthought. \n\nHowever, while you hesitantly make your way towards the bathroom, be sure to check out the posters lining the wall of the stairs. Some of the past line-ups may astound you(And the prices you could have seen them for). Make no mistake, there is a fairly solid quality to the music here(especially from touring bands) and over the years many of them go on to be influential in one way or another. So if it's your thing, but sure to stop out and catch a show - the music will probably be solid, and the tickets are cheap!\n\nThey're the only place on the street that requests donations for entry during Unblurred, but honestly I can't imagine the place is a gold mine regularly and the music they host is important to Pittsburgh(in my opinion), so I never mind tossing in a few bucks. Also, IMO, promotion isn't the best here, so check the website to find out the latest shows, or stop in during Unblurred.", "type": "review", "business_id": "3G8_qVxaTkkO5b70_H8YDA"}

Some dishes remind me of food fads from the 90's (e.g., the chef seems to have a penchant for meat and fruit pairing). Overall, the menu is too long and rambling without a theme, covering everything from the Baja to the Mediterranean. \n\nThe food was unremarkable. The bread tasted like a generic supermarket baguette; it was served with olive oil and powdery parm (i.e., from the green can). For appetizers, we ordered the prosciutto and figs as well as the trout and peaches. They were probably the highlight of the meal, but the portions were tiny, and the ingredients were not the best. For the main course, I tried their fish taco, which was on the bland and dry side. \n\nSummary: if you are ever nostalgic for \"fine dining in a small American town during the 80's,\" this place is for you.", "type": "review", "business_id": "XzaJf6WzpU7RsXTXzx72Xg"}

The inside was, as others have already commented, very pastel and outdated, reminding me of my grandmother's 80th birthday party.  Definitely could use an overhaul in my opinion, but then again there were quite a few old ladies there, so maybe they just know their crowd.  \n\nI'll cut to the chase: the food was GREAT.

Ritter's Diner is directly across the street and I eat there all the time.  In my mind a place can only  get better.  As our party of three walks in we are promptly seated by the manager.  Looking over the menu, we all decide on what we want and order:\n\nFrench Onion\nBuffalo Chicken Medallions \nFish Tacos with salsa and guacamole\nCheeseburger (medium) with apple sauce and potato salad\nSide of Fries\nWater and Iced Tea with Lemon\n\nBread with butter, olive oil infused with pumpkin, and our drinks soon arrive.  ALERT: The tea is flavored.  I really do dislike flavored teas, but I put extra lemon in mine to cover the foul taste and continued on.  The bread was slightly aged as the crust was somewhat hard.  The olive oil was fairly tasteless, but fresh.  I would never use a light olive oil for tasting purposes like Cafe Sam did.  While it was an interesting thought to add pumpkin seeds -- this is the current theme -- they didn't add that much to the oil.  At least the butter was soft rather than frozen.\n\nAs we planned work for the next next day, our Buffalo Chicken Medallions arrived.  They need to remove the \"s\" from Medallions as there was only piece.  In fact, they need to remove \"medallion\" and \"buffalo\" from the name and call it something else.  It was just a piece of chicken breast dredged in Cajun seasoning with a few stray strands of cheese melted on it.  Don't get me wrong, it didn't taste bad; but a better name would have been \"Cajun Chicken Breast\" rather than what they call it now.  As I ate the chicken, the French Onion Soup arrived.  This crock of soup looked exceptionally good.  The cheese on top was browned to the proper point.  I took the spoon and cut in with a voraciousness as I could taste it already.  When I put the first bite in my mouth though, the flavor was flat.  I took another bite and it was the same thing.  This wasn't French Onion soup with layers of flavor, but an onion broth that had some cheap, melted cheese on top.  It didn't taste bad, but anyone could make this soup.\n\nI ate half the soup and passed it on to my friend to finish along with the rest of the chicken breast.  I didn't want to eat too much and then not be able to eat the main course.  \n\nAs my friend finished the soup our entrees arrived.  The cheeseburger was served on a piece of a larger sesame baguette and came well done rather than the requested medium.  I didn't try it due to the fact it was overcooked and had sesame seeds.  I did try the apple sauce and the potato salad, though.  The potato salad was just not tasty.  One bite and I didn't want to take another.  The apple sauce, on the other hand, was quite tasty -- I wouldn't call it apple sauce, though.  It was more along the line of fried apples -- some damn tasty fried apples.\n\nAs I wasn't having any of the cheeseburger, I ate all of the fish tacos.  The tacos arrived presented on a sprinkling of iceberg lettuce.  I would think that they should make it a bed of lettuce or just omit it all together.  I am for the latter over the former as I don't eat iceberg lettuce -- no nutrients, just water.  While the fish didn't have bad flavor, it was a tad overcooked.  When I started to eat the tacos, this wasn't a big deal.  As the fish cooled off, though, they started to get too hard for their own good.  The fish tacos need to be cooked less, especially with the fact that they are using white, flaky fish, which is easily overcooked.  At least the guacamole was fresh and tasted good.\n\nAll in all, this was a lackluster event.  If not for the fried apples, guacamole, and great service this would have been a one-star.  I don't know that I would ever willingly return since I was in sticker shock when our server brought our check.  The price was not commensurate with the quality of the food.  People complain about the quality of the food at Ritter's diner, but the food is actually commensurate to the price that you pay.  When I pay over $20 a person to eat, I expect better than diner fare.", "type": "review", "business_id": "XzaJf6WzpU7RsXTXzx72Xg"}

Been a customer for years and have no plans to change that. While it has several notable flaws, the all-around strengths of this establishment make it a top any-occasion choice in Pittsburgh. \n\nSituated in what looks like a small white house than you'd never see unless looking for, this is a quirky, unique interior. There is a piano at the bar, and a mannequin sitting there you'd swear was real until you looked with a startled grin. \n\nOne of two managers always greet you and check in at least once at your table. They are friendly, solicitous, and helpful. \n\nThe service can be under-experienced at times, but always, ALWAYS pleasant and helpful. They bring out a card at the beginning of each meal and read of a seemingly endless list of specials not on the menu. These are amazing - they vary from the simple (pierogies fried in butter and onions) to the weird (duck mousse and pita). As if these aren't options aren't enough, your large menu, including seafood, steak, meats, and pastas, has each option prepared in your choice of three different ways. This makes it perfect for the picky and the adventurous both. \n\nA winning touch is the staff that circulates with free drink samples and hors-douvres. I've been to many a restaurant and yet to find any at this level that offer this touch of service that makes you glad you're there. \n\nThe price for all this is quite fair! After taking my mother there and having a drink, appetizers, salads, dinner, and dessert, the check was under $70 with tip. I don't think these prices can be beat. \n\nThe cons are only two: (1) Not every dish is executed well. They strive to be new, adventurous and different, and don't always succeed; (2) I'm a huge fan of desserts and, though there's always quite the variance, I've yet to have one that I enjoyed. The coconut ice cream was in particular a failure: vanilla ice cream with tasteless, dry coconut flakes on it is pretty inexcusable. \n\nAll in all, I couldn't really recommend a place more highly for any occasion more fancy than McDonald's and less fancy than Ruth's Chris.", "type": "review", "business_id": "XzaJf6WzpU7RsXTXzx72Xg"}

Just like a very typical Pittsburgh Place it was a converted house which was very quaint.  The inside was very eclectic but very welcoming.  Our serve was Rachel; she was very friendly and attentive.  We started out with a serving of Pan Fried Provolone and the Smoke Shrimp.  The Pan Fried Provolone was extremely flavorful because the pan frying gave great crisp without the oily taste from deep frying.  Also with the pan frying the provolone really infused into the bread crumb coating.  Caf\u00e9 Sam does all of its smoking and the smoked shrimp really proved that having smoked sea food takes the flavor to the next level.  The shrimp was perfectly cooked and the smoke was not over powering and it was enough to elevate the flavor in the shrimp flavor.  \n\nWe next had our main meal, my daughter had the Angel Hair Pasta and Shrimp, My wife had the Fresh Chicken Buffalo Style, and I had the home smoke pork chop and sweet Jalapeno and Chipotle sauce.  The pasta was cooked to perfection and the sauce my daughter chose was a cream garlic sauce.  The cool thing about Caf\u00e9 Sam is the Chef gives you a choice of multiple sauces per dish.  It can be a little overwhelming at first but once you get the hang of it, it is nice to have the choice.  The shrimp was done to perfection and the sauce was the perfect match with the shrimp.  My wife's Fresh Chicken Buffalo Style was also prepared to perfection.  The chicken was not dry and the seasoning wasn't over powering to the chicken.  The top of the night was the special Home Smoked Pork Chop.  The smoke provided the Pork a sweetness that only just the right amount of smoking can give pork.  It was moist and tender and very flavorful.  \n\nAs I said Caf\u00e9 Sam was unique, we were serenaded by one of the waiters and let me tell you he was good.  Unfortunately the outside was not open this evening because the outside looks like it would it would be great time to eat el fresco.  I highly recommend you try this place it is a great experience.", "type": "review", "business_id": "XzaJf6WzpU7RsXTXzx72Xg"}

The first time I dined here, I was looking forward to it, because everyone whom I've ever heard talk about this place raved about it, yet I left wondering if everyone who has raved about it just has really bad taste in restaurants and their definition of \"good\" food.\n\nSo, on my second visit I inwardly cringed as my 2 companions raved about the place and teased the waitress about the list of specials which is absolutely ridiculous however it does seem as though the restaurant has pared down their enormous menu and specials menu from the only other time that I was there (I remember it taking our waitress at least 5 minutes to ramble off the specials on the previous visit while on this particular visit it seemed to take half the time.  \n\nI ordered the linguine with shrimp scampi which I asked to add spinach but was told that it already had spinach (the menu is so large that it would be impossible for them to list the ingredients in each dish) - so while someone may think, \"oh, it's great that they have a large menu,\" the truth of the matter is that they don't seem to be able to therefore do anything well - it's all rather extremely mediocre at best to nearly inedible.  My companions enjoyed their meals however, and they ordered the linguine with salmon and the smoked hot dog special covered in some sort of  BBQ type of sauce.  My pasta was bland - I never add salt when I go out to eat and I had to add salt but even adding salt and some pepper really did nothing to give the dish flavor.  I left the restaurant dissatisfied and hungry for a good plate of pasta, which I rarely eat by the way, and it actually had me thinking about how much better the Olive Garden's pasta is compared to Cafe Sam.  I'm just completely baffled about the popularity of this restaurant though as some others who have given the restaurant the fair 1-3 star reviews have already mentioned, this is a haven for senior citizens and from the other Yelp reviews for out of town guests who maybe don't know what good food really is.  With all of the other options available nearby in Shadyside and in Bloomfield this is the last place that I would go next to the other Baum Blvd. debacle, Ritter's Diner.  I don't know why or how folks flock to either restaurant nor how they rave about either establishment other than to say that both places must hold some nostalgic value that makes people overlook the bad food.", "type": "review", "business_id": "XzaJf6WzpU7RsXTXzx72Xg"}

You walk into the storefront into a cavern of bike things and bike parts. Literally things stacked everywhere... with a narrow aisle that you can just barely walk with your bike through. The back of the store is a mechanic room that has several stations/stands where you can work on your bike - it's a bit more open, but also lined with shelfs and stacks of parts, and tools and scrap. There always seems to be people there who are willing to help or offer their opinion on how to do things. Gerry is also willing to help you with any other things you don't know or can't figure out by yourself. This is an awesome shop if you need anything special, if you lost a bolt or a nut or any other little piece that you can think of and need a replacement, this is the place to go. I love that you can spend an afternoon fixing up your bike your self, and having any of the tools or parts that you would need available and also at the cheapest possible price (for the parts). First time I was ever there, Gerry greeted me nicely, and invited me back into the shop to do the the work myself. I consulted him a couple of times - it was a busy afternoon at the shop, but he told me what i needed to do... and left me to play with it myself. I'm sure if you know nothing about bikes, or are working on a more complicated issue, he would have just as much insight, though I still get the feeling that he expects you to learn and pull your own weight in the repair/maintenance of your bike. I like that do-it-yourself attitude, but if you are looking for a place to drop off your bike and have the shop do all the work, this is probably not the place. \n\nAs far as Gerry being gruff... i didn't have that experience, really, but I see what people mean. I think he is not that outgoing and personable in a superficial way, but is willing to help or talk to anyone who wants to learn about their bike or needs help.

My first visit to Kraynick's was during a panic situation, otherwise known as a tire blow-out.  Having commuted to work daily by bike for 3+ years, I've been strangely immune to things like flats, blowouts, or really anything of the sort.  So when it happened, I had no clue what to do.  I thought about visiting Performance Bike in East Liberty, where I purchased my current ride, but the lure of Kraynick's was too much.  Plus, I was able to leave work 10 minutes early and actually get there before their 6pm closing time.  \n\nWith busted tire in one hand, I pushed the door open and was greeted with - well, I'm not really sure how to describe it.  An avalanche perhaps, of bicycle parts EVERYWHERE.  Seriously, hanging in every nook and cranny; taking up every inch of counter space; even occupying each step of the stairs near the front door (at least I think they were stairs...).  I'm pretty sure I just stood there in awe for a minute before taking a few more hesitant steps inside.  \n\nI'd read enough reviews to know that the white-haired man was Jerry.  I waited for a few minutes while Jerry finished up with his customer and then just sort of presented my tire to him with a smile and a look that said \"please don't judge me for not knowing what to do about this.\"  No judgement.  Jerry told me that it was a dangerous blowout and he hoped that I hadn't been going too fast.  Then he plucked an identical tire from the ceiling rack above his head and asked me if I needed anything else.  I rocked back and forth on my heels a few times before sheepishly asking if he could tell me how to change the tire once I returned home.  In, I swear, no less than 10 words, he explained the process and wished me luck.  For $20 I bought a tire, tube and the, um, the things you use to take the tire off...tire irons?  I'll take a class someday. Seriously.  \n\nAaaanyway.  I returned to the shop earlier this week with the other tire, which had been experiencing an annoying slow leak.  Jerry told me it was just the tube and offered his tools in \"the back\" so I could do a quick change.  Well, if the front room was filled to the brim with every part under the cycle sun, the back room was equally bursting with every tool imaginable; none of which I knew how to use.  With the kind help of a few of the guys who were working on their own bikes, I managed to change out the tube in no time, leaving the shop with a kind of silly sense of accomplishment and some incredibly black hands.", "type": "review", "business_id": "HzZmhlRNLtPkMI0egh9Oig"}

Tonight was the conclusion a long day and all I wanted was to go back to my hosteI and maybe grab a bite to eat. In my haste to get dinner before I passed out, I almost made the mistake of entering Fazio's, the other hole-in-the-wall pizza joint on Penn Avenue in Lawrenceville. Well-I am glad I did not do that!  Remembering that the restaurant I quickly Yelped before walking out from the hostel had a longer name, I continued to walk down Penn Avenue until I found Graziano's. Upon entering, I was greeted by a slightly unwelcoming smell. It wasn't pizza I was smelling, or at least fresh pizza. But I remembered how positive all the reviews on Yelp were. I was a little disappointed when I saw how small their menu was, and yet it still took me a while to order. I first contemplated getting the fried fish with french fries. I do love a crispy fish sandwich. There was even a girl at another table who had just gotten hers for eating there. I tried to inconspicuously spy her fried fish. It looked good but it's a who lot a fish. I decided to order the steak and cheese sub instead. Now that I am home eating, I am glad I went to Graziano's and I am very impressed with their steak sub. Meaty, greasy, tangy, and large. What more can I say? That's a good steak sub. The bread is slightly toasted but still soft. Just perfect. I don't know many places that put Italian dressing and mayo on steak and cheeses, but I like the combo. It's more than enough food for 2 and only costed 9 bucks. I think I will finish it all off because I did not eat lunch today. MMM. stiill got lots more to enjoy. I recommend Graziano's for take out, not eating in.

There are probably around 10 tables in the dining room portion of the restaurant with a single flat screen hung in one corner so that you can watch as you eat.  Just past the dining room and on the way to the register were about 6 beer coolers filled with everything from your normal adjunct lagers to Four Loko and even some more expensive 22 oz Dog Fish Head bottles.  As a beer lover who normally doesn't drink adjunct lagers if I can help it, I was really impressed with their selection.  As a matter of a fact in the hour or so that we were there, I actually saw more people get beer to go than order their food.  For our dinner we decided to get a large pizza with chicken on it.  It came out piping hot and I was surprised at how large it actually was.  What I was not as big of a fan of was the amount of grease that was still on the pizza but I understand that is what happens with cooked cheese  As with most pizzas, there are the three major components to them cheese, sauce and crust.  The crust was definitely the standout of this pie as it was crispy while not being too think.  The sauce was merely average as I did not really notice any spices in it or anything to distinguish it from anything else.  Finally the cheese was decent, there was a lot of it, and I enjoyed the garlic flavoring that was with the cheese.  Overall it wasn't the best pizza in the world but I enjoyed eating it and it got the job done.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I may head back here in the future.

Our red pizza was a similar experience as I imagine the cheese and crust were the same and while the red sauce was good, it lacked a little of the oomph that white sauce had.

It's VERY inexpensive, and worth the all-you-can-eat.  They offer several meat and non-meat choices, plenty of sides, rice, nan, salads, chutneys - and even a pretty yummy hot chai tea that is very creamy and sweet.\n\nThe service is pleasant, and the atmosphere is comfortable.  Although when they're really busy, you may be forced to make a new friend at the next table, which really is pretty much the same as them sitting at YOUR table.\n\nThe crowd was interesting as well, students en masse, single diners, and pairs - all seeming a little more on the intellectual end of the scale than one might normally see in da burgh.\n\nMy only disappointment was the palak paneer which had potato instead of the cheese...although I may have just read the sign wrong, and it wasn't really palak paneer.  The chicken dish was absolutely delicious, and the samosa were yummy.\n\nCan't do Indian food without a big ol' samosa with the green mint chutney sauce.\n\nGenerally, nothing uber-fancy, but definitely worth a try.", "type": "review", "business_id": "PhIGoo9g6GBrqgH_6yZXXQ"}

In hindsight, that was a bad choice. Although they were supposed to be cold, it had a tingle of the ingredients inside being undercooked and the pork was actually just the same type of ham you would find in a salad bar. It wasn't what I expected.\n\nI got the #19 (beef and tripe pho) and my friend got the #20 beef balls and it came out smelling pretty nicely and in an extra large bowl. The traditional uncooked bean curd and basil leaves accommodated it but as I started to eat more and more of it, I feel that the taste began to taste marginally...blander.

The food isn't the best I've ever had, but its quality is consistently good, particularly for PIttsburgh.  This place would probably still get three stars in a town with a larger Vietnamese populatrion, and in the Burgh it deserves four.  It usually has a mixed crowd of Vietnamese patrons and non-Vietnamese.  This is the place I used to regularly turn to on non-Tuesday nights (they're closed) in mid-Feburary.\n\nUntil about three years ago, the broth was a little erratic.  Some days, it was quite flavorful and others watery.  Then, the in-laws showed up (I'm assuming from Vietnam), and the consistency and quality of the soup broth shot up.  The pho is significantly more flavorful than nearby (and only) competitor Tram's, and the family that runs it is much friendlier.\n\nFood highlights -\n    The pho is above average, particularly if you order it with beef raw (aka \"rare\") on the side.\n    The green papaya salad with dried beef (#12) is spicy and fabulous.\n    The fried spring rolls, both with shrimp and vegetarian, are excellent.\n    The shrimp and BBQ pork dish (#43) is one of my wife's favorites.\n\nFood cons - \n   The chicken pho is a bit meh.\n   The fresh spring rolls tend to have wrappers that are a bit too gummy and thick.  All I end up tasting is the roll, rather than the basil-sprout-crunch inside.\n   They always have omitted hot pepper slices from their tray of pho fixings, something I tend to enjoy.\n\nNotes - If you tend to like the raw beef in your pho, it's often kept in the freezer (for Dept. of Public Health concerns).  Then, it's often best to order the pho to go, heat it up to near-boiling on your stove, then serve it so that the broth is at a temperature high enough to cook it in your bowl, giving the broth a nice beefy cloud, as well.", "type": "review", "business_id": "uBW3PIKqc-_eyG1_vdJn1w"}

My first pho experience was at Lulu's Noodles in Oakland...  and it has set the bar.  Yeah, the noodles aren't quite right, and the broth is not quite right, either...  but...  the chicken is GREAT.  It's nice and tender.  \n\nSince then I had some pho in California and the broth is better...  the noodles are better...  but the chicken is weirdly dry and tough.  I don't know how chicken cooked in soup can be dry and tough, but it is.  \n\nIn that respect...  the pho at Pho Minh seemed quite authentic.  Noodles were good, broth was good - but chicken dry and tough.  Why does Lulu's have the market cornered on tender chicken in their pho???  \n\nMy son had the beef pho and the broth was SO much tastier than the chicken - the chicken was OK but it's the beef broth that is awesome.  \n\nMy biggest problem was I thought the portions seemed kinda small, for what you paid.  I guess they are adequate, but not super-satiating, for a pho crazed adult.  My plan was to share mine with my two toddlers, we tend to be light eaters, and it was kind of tense.  I expect a bowl of pho to be giant, based on my CA experiences.  I guess if we go again, the girls are going to have to get their own bowl to split.  \n\nI guess it is a credit to this place that my two picky toddlers liked it so much!\n\nDecent pho, portions kinda small, service REALLY slow.

The dining room is tiny but spotless and bright, and the free pots of tea are a nice touch. The take-out pho is packaged very thoroughly and intelligently. In a plastic tub goes the broth, beef and onions. The noodles are packaged separately in a little plastic bag so they don't get soggy before you have a chance to eat.

I didn't say much about the food in my previous review, so thought I'd rectify that. \n\nI'm a big fan of Vietnamese bun, which is a dish made with rice noodles and some kind of grilled meat, usually served in a big bowl with sprouts, cukes, scallions, peanuts, cilantro, lettuce and carrots. What I'm looking for when I order this is meat (I usually get chicken) that has been well marinated, as this lends alot of the flavor to this dish. Pho Minh marinates theirs in hoisin and maybe other things, and it's delicious. They add a little of this sauce to the noodles and garnish with the salad, then serve it with their wonderful fish sauce. This is a dish I crave. Their veggies are really fresh, the meat is succulent, and all of the flavors complement eachother so well. I like a deep fried spring roll with my bun, so I always order one, and they slice it and serve it right in the bowl. These are great here...really meaty little rolls. They use pork, and it's almost like a pork meatball filling. When you order these as an appetizer you get 2 of them and a side of their molasses/fish sauce combo. Doug had the Hu tieu xao, which is chicken, shrimp and veggies stir fried with rice noodles. This dish has some funky Vietnamese flavors, and has fish sauce as a base for the stir fry sauce, so you have to like that, but if you do, this dish rocks. Like all of their food, it was very well prepared and delicious. The woman who waits tables here always offers us their traditional mung bean pudding dessert, and we always say yes. This is a sweet and starchy treat served hot with a lacing of coconut milk. I love it. Tea comes to the table automatically and is free, and they offer some nice hot and iced beverages in addition. We didn't have the pho on this visit, but I will reiterate that it's great. I think this is the best Vietnamese restaurant in Pittsburgh.\n\nThis is a family owned and operated restaurant, so you will see the same friendly faces when you become a regular. Early on we learned to say hello/good afternoon in Vietnamese ( xin chao, pronounced shin chow) and we always get a big smile from the older gentleman who owns the place.

This is one of those places that I would go to every day if I could. I love Vietnamese food, and have tried it in a fair number of cities. This was by far better than the best Vietnamese in Boston (Xinh Xinh) and a close second to the best Vietnamese in Seattle (Pho Bac). \n\nI found Pho Minh, sort of on accident, my first trip to Pittsburgh. The owners were very kind and attentive. The food was delicious, fresh, everything was clean. The pho broth was the best I've ever had, delicately spiced and flavorful. They don't pre-cook the beef, which is excellent, so it doesn't become too chewy (it cooks in the broth). The second time we went to Pho Minh was the first night we got to Pittsburgh when we moved (this should tell you how excited we were). Coming from Boston, it didn't occur to us that it might be closing at 9pm. We got there at 9:15pm and they kindly asked if we wanted them to make us up some food to go. Even that was good.\n\nWe kept hearing, over and over again, that Tram's was freaking fantastic and we should go there instead. So we did. It was a mistake. I have no idea what everyone is talking about. The ambiance? What ambiance? It smelled like urine.

Hence the 4 stars. I probably order out from here 3-4 times a month. It is my 2nd most favorite Pho in Pittsburgh. I don't stray from my favorites dishes below, so I can't speak beyond what I will post. \n\nFor an appetizer, I order the Crispy Shrimp Rolls. Oh my! What little pieces of crispy, shrimp heaven. They are smaller shrimps, but the price is affordable so I don't mind. In my opinion what really drives this dish to excellence is the Vietnamese dipping sauce (nuoc cham). From what I learned about nuoc cham, every Vietnamese family has their own twist on it. The ingredients in nuoc cham are generally the same, but the proportions vary based on personal tastes and regions in Vietnam. According to Vietnamese cookbook author, Andrea Nguyen, \"as you move south the sauce gets sweeter, hotter, and more garlicky.\" YUMMY!\n\nI thoroughly enjoy the Pho Meatball entree. I LOVE fresh herbs and spices. Pho rice noddles served along side crunchy and light bean sprouts. Fresh cilantro and basil. I consider myself a Pho Meatball amateur connoisseur of sorts. I only order this dish, no matter where I eat Pho at. I like the way they slice the meatballs at this establishment unlike other places. It makes it easier to grab with the chopsticks =) Also they have less grisley pieces in this meatball Pho. I've never dissected them, but assume it is part tripe. The flavor is moderate with the slightest hint of kick. Also the lemongrass in the soup broth is so amazing. It is the epitome of Vietnamese comfort foods in my opinion. Coupled with the addition of Sriracha chile sauce and Hoisin sauce they include on the side is amazing. \n\nThe staff are polite and quick. One never waits long for your food. It is a little disappointing that they open for dinner so late. It would be nice to grab something right when I get off work versus waiting for 5pm to roll around. However, I cannot deny that it is most definitely worth the wait! Oh and like others have said, they are NOT OPEN on TUESDAYS. Odd, I know.\n\nThere are two things to be mindful of 1. If you are dining in- your portion size of Pho will be larger. This is not just at this Vietnamese place it is pretty much the norm for the other Vietnamese places around the PGH area. 2. Cash only. This last one is a major pain to me. I am not the cash and carry type of person.", "type": "review", "business_id": "uBW3PIKqc-_eyG1_vdJn1w"}

Lesson I learned before was that this could be a sign that this restaurant would be tailoring to american taste. But since I drove 80 miles already I decided to give it a try. the menu was pretty small comparing to mecca of Asian food (Southern California). Ordered the Pho dac bet. When the pho came out, i thought it would be like the Southern California size as the bowl was decent size. But the pho and soup were sitting at the bottom of the bowl, about 1/3 full. I was a bit disappointed. I loaded up my bean sprouts into the hot soup and did a quick stir to cook the raw thinly slice steak. The pho was actually pretty decent. The soup was flavorful and the pho was well cooked. Just wish the amount of pho and the ingredients could be more.

HOWEVER...having traveled to Vietnam, and having been to a wide variety of Vietnamese restaurants around the US, this is certainly one of the most authentic. In fact, it reminds me of being in Vietnam. Are the spices on point? Yes! Delicious bowls of soup that should leave you with enough to bring home? Check! A couple cobwebs in the corner? Most definitely! An experience, to be sure. The place was about deserted on a Monday at lunch time, which was great for us - we got a window seat!\n\nWe started our meal with tea - this was your basic tea, nothing to write home about. We added on the spring roll with shrimp - and it was obviously freshly handmade to our order. Great appetizer to begin with - it's my barometer of a Vietnamese restaurant. This was a good one, not the best I've ever had, but quite tasty. I followed this up with a green papaya salad - heavy on the fish sauce (yum!) and covered in shrimp and peanuts. Very refreshing and light. My friend ordered the chicken curry with yam, which was creamy, freshly made (the veggies were not overcooked, as you find most places that premake lots of food) and not too spicy. I ordered the spicy vegetable soup with mushrooms. I'm not your average diner, and I like my spicy foods VERY spicy. This was maybe a 1-2/10. Pretty disappointing to me, but luckily the table was equipped with homemade Sriracha-like sauce and the ubiquitous chili-in-oil sauce found in cafes all over Vietnam. This solved the problem.

They allowed us to bring all 4 in at once, and gave us complete instructions on caring for 4 3-4 week old kittens. \nWe were in the Cat Clinic almost weekly tracking their progress for the first month. They were amazing, remembered all the kittens names (which isn't easy) and the cost was reasonable. Now our house is ran by 4 crazy brothers, and we still go to the Cat Clinic. If I ever have to bring in just one of the boys for anything, they always ask about the other 3. In fact, one of my boys has FVR and I had to bring him in alone for some antibiotics for a pretty terrible flair up. I had recently taken one of his brothers to PVSEC for a broken leg. As soon as I walked in door all the employees were there asking how the broken leg kitty was doing as PVSEC had sent them his records. Also, with the Cat Clinics guidance, my FVR kitty has only had that one flair up that required antibiotics.\nDr. Bebko very knowledgeable, and its easy to tell that every employee there has a real love for cats. There was one day I had to bring in all 4 by myself for their yearly checkups and vaccinations. One of the reception staff saw me, and came out to help carry in all the carriers so that I wouldn't have to leave two out in the car and make a second trip. Also, one of my boys has \"tough skin\" and it can be tricky to get the vaccine needle in in one shot. Dr. Bebko will ask one of the assistants to come back and hold and pet the little guy while administering the shots to make it less traumatic for him. It's also a great bonus for my one scaredy cat that he doesn't have to sit in a waiting room filled with dogs, as that stresses him out a great deal. \nI couldn't imagine taking my boys anywhere else.", "type": "review", "business_id": "zczKkfpjz510tZK0SnHYDQ"}

The south hills needs a place like this. If I didn't live so gosh darn far away, I'd be here multiple times a week. \nI stopped back to Groceria Italiana after a food tour in Bloomfield a few weeks ago to pick up a few things for dinner. I decided to purchase the special- sausage ravioli because the owner had informed us that everything is made in house. Even the suasage is ground and tested in house before putting into the ravioli. I also left with marinara sauce and pepperoni bread. \nThe pepperoni bread was light, fluffy and delicious. \nThe ravioli is easily the best ravioli I have ever had. Each little pocket of heaven was hand made and was slightly different in shape and size from each other. The tall tale sign that they were pressed by hand. We followed the directions on the box and BAKED (not boiled) them in sauce. I've literally thought about those ravioli every time I have had italian food since.

The staff has always been incredibly nice to us, and they'll remember you after only one or two trips. Great people! You can tell it's a family-run business!\n\nOf course, even if the service was awful, I would probably be able to overlook it for the food! The pastas that we've tried are all really good. The ravioli is excellent! We like their lasagnas, but haven't quite perfected how to cook them in the little pan. They just never crisp up for us, but it doesn't really matter. The flavor is still a winner. Be warned, though...the lasagnas are VERY cheesy (which I love), but that might not be everyone's thing. My go-to would be the eggplant lasagna or cheese ravioli if I was in a heavy pasta mood. If you get their plain pastas, you won't be disappointed, either. There's just something about fresh pasta that can't be beat!\n\nTheir pepperoni rolls, if you're there early enough to get one, are my another favorite. They practically taste like pepperoni croissants...and who wouldn't want that? \n\nNot to be overlooked by my sweet-tooth having self are the desserts. The almond cream cake and the tiramisu are two of my favorite desserts around. Just let them sit out to thaw for 20 minutes, and then allow yourself to be overwhelmed by the deliciousness! The tiramisu just blows my mind. We usually buy two when we go...and they don't last more than a day!\n\nIf you're not in the mood to do your own cooking, you can always hit up their prepared foods section, too (where you'll find the pepperoni rolls). The meatballs are soooooo good, but don't forget to grab a batch of their marinara!\n\nPlaces like this are too wonderful to overlook. I'm just bummed that it took me 7 years of living in Pittsburgh to find out about Groceria Italiana!", "type": "review", "business_id": "DsxLIr-b6WlDn9YNsVBu_A"}

I considered getting the raviolis, but decided against it because (1) I already had some frozen raviolis in the freezer (though I'm sure theirs are much better); (2) They're not cheap, at $7ish per box; (3) I wanted a hot take-out dinner.  Since I'd heard good things about the pepperoni rolls but had never tried a pepperoni roll, I asked the guy working behind the counter if they had any.  He confirmed that they did, so I bought one of them plus a tiramisu, which came to about $12.\n\nUpon arriving home, I decided to heat up the pepperoni roll in the toaster oven.  It was excellent, with light and fluffy but substantial bread, plenty of pepperoni slices, and a layer of mozzarella cheese.  While I liked the flavor, it occurred to me that some marinara sauce would make it even more flavorful, so I heated up some in the microwave and proceeded to dip the roll in the sauce as I ate it.  (As a newbie to pepperoni rolls, I don't know if this is a common practice.)  Ideally, I should have asked if they had any marinara sauce for dipping, since a higher-quality marinara sauce would have been even better.  Oh, well--I'll do that next time.\n\nThe tiramisu was even better than the pepperoni roll.  I've had tiramisu a couple of times, but I don't seek it out since I'm not a huge fan of coffee-flavored desserts.  This tiramisu is addictive, however, and the espresso-soaked ladyfingers had me wanting more every time I ate a piece.  Even if you're not a big tiramisu fan, I'd suggest trying their version--it's tiramisu the way tiramisu should taste.\n\nPerhaps the most notable thing about this store is that the majority of products appear to be homemade (i.e., non-commercial).  Aside from the items I've already mentioned, they have an assortment of cheeses, pasta, and pizzelles.  I look forward to visiting again and partaking of some more Italian goodness soon!\n\nEDIT: I tried the sun dried tomato basil ravioli, and they were absolutely delicious. Just make sure to bake them according to the directions--the reviewer who said they fell apart on him obviously tried to boil them.

Thank goodness for cell phones, we were able to change our theater tickets to the following weekend, and had our van driver turn around and get us the hell out of the mess. \n\nBut now that we had the day planned and thwarted by the city that can't think fully, what were we going to do?  We asked the driver to drop us off in Bloomfield, and we would have lunch there...but where?  Tessaro's was OUT (see my review for Tessaro's) and so many things had come and gone since I've been to Bloomfield that we weren't sure what would be there.  Pleasure Bar was out, after redneck hillbillies with guns started bashing 'fags', and Pleasure Bar didn't seem too concerned about it. \n\nAHA!  I've heard so much about it, and never actually went in and tried it...so voila, the plan was hatched...Armand's for a fish sandwich!\n\nI had just thought about a 'fish fry' type sandwich the night before, knowing that St. Raphael's down the street was holding their Lent fish fry...but I have a problem handing money over to a Catholic fundraiser anything, and frankly, their spaghetti dinner for a army officer's fundraiser was a little on the Chef-Boy-Ar-Dee side.\n\nWalking into Armand's was a little bit of a shock.  I did NOT expect it to be an absolute dive bar, and at 1:30 in the afternoon, it was pretty much full of dive bar regulars.  My second surprise was that they also allowed smoking, which I am not for or against, being a smoker, but the air was a deep stale rank dive bar smoke filled atmosphere.  \n\nWe started to sit in the bar area, and then I noticed some Burger King type booths in a back room, and asked the bar tender how we ordered the fish? He directed us to the back room, and said that we'd have to order there.\n\nWe made our way to the back room, and there we found a little ordering window, with a minimal menu.  Fish sandwiches, large and small, shrimp baskets, large and small, burger, a few toppings that were extra (cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles) and a few sides (fries, zucchini planks, cheese sticks, cole slaw, etc.) and that was about it.  Sodas were $1, and came from a machine in the room.\n\nWe ordered one large, and one small fish sandwich, fries, and zucchini planks, and I bought two cans of soda from the machine.  We did have to wait a little while for the food, but we learned why, and it was absolutely fine.  \n\nA woman from the bar came back and asked if the lady in the kitchen had 'forgotten' her fish.  The lady responded \"No, I didn't forget it, I have a bunch of orders, and I have to cut it, bread it, clean the grease, and cook it!  I'll bring it out to you as soon as it's done!\"\n\nThis one woman was doing it ALL, and she was doing it from scratch.  When she got the other woman's fish on a plate and started walking it out, she paused by our table and said that she'd have ours in just a minute.  She then explained the woman asking if she'd forgotten again, and the whole process, and said \"She ain't at McDonald's!  This is the best fish sandwich in town for a reason!  People can be a real F$%king pain in my A$$!\"  \n\nAnd I thought - atta girl - I'm at home!  This is going to be great!\n\nShe brought out our plates.  Ilene's 'small' was rather large, and my large was basically the same 'size' but with a double helping of fish. The fries were decent, and the zucchini really looked like she had taken one medium sized zucchini, rammed it through a slicer lengthwise, battered it, and fried it up. They were HUGE strips, all from the same zucchini.  \n\nThe food was good.  I'm not going to say 'best' fish sandwich. But it was huge, tasty, and the sides were good.  I will say that Frankie's fish sandwich at Cattivo is more complete, and a little more flavorful, but not nearly as big...and it's pretty big.  So so far, Cattivo still wins, but Armand's comes in second.  Both places are bars, and both allow smoking, but Cattivo is bigger and airier (which can dissipate the smoke concentration), and sandwich has a bit more 'flair' to make it tastier.  \n\nPrices at Armand's are average. $8 something for the small and $10 something for the large, but all toppings are ala carte.\n\nDon't dismiss the sandwich though for the dive bar atmosphere.  It IS a sought after years old tradition - and apparently consistent.  If you're hankering for a good jumbo sized fish sandwich, no frills, like the corner dive bar used to serve up all over town - well kids, this one still does it the way it's supposed to be done.

The drinks are absurdly cheap and the pour wondrously stiff. The people who drink there are friendly and when I've gone there with my husband we've been just left alone to drink and relax and when I've gone there with female friends old guys sometimes talk to us in a totally jovial/friendly/non-threatening way, but I've never had a problem just having my own space.\n\nThe bartenders are so sweet and as I said, very generous with their pours.\n\nSeriously, I love Armand's Bar. First discovered it because I wanted to try the fish sandwich they brag about and it is DELICIOUS! I crave it every time I know I'm going back to da 'burgh. I seriously think this is the best fish sandwich in the city, and that is saying something in a place where many restaurants do a great fish sandwich.\n\nSo, this is five stars for a *dive bar* because if you want the *dive bar* experience, this is it, and it's awesome. Obviously this is not a place to go get a great Sazerac (er, or any Sazerac), and yes, the bathroom's kind of iffy, but if you just want a place that is totally chill and downtempo where you can drink with friends, it's a great spot.", "type": "review", "business_id": "FD6OocZdFUfE2J5H0WN4fA"}

Two (yes, two) flaky, buttery whitefish fillets generously coated in a cornmeal-based batter and fried to golden, crispy perfection.  The sandwich barely qualifies as such, as it wears its bun like a hat.  I would note that tartar sauce if pretty much obligatory since the fish, while firm and flavorful, is naturally a bit dry.

Don't get me wrong: the food is good, the service is great, and if you're already in the Bloomfield area, it's a fine choice for dinner.  But, there are a few unfortunate and glaring errors that prevent Taste of India from being much more than an average-level restaurant.\n\nFirst and foremost, I've tried just about everything I can imagine, and I can't seem to get Taste of India to actually serve me *spicy* food.  I'm a huge fan of vindaloo, which is often the spiciest item on an Indian menu (at least in the United States), but at Taste of India, it's about as spicy as a can of Chef Boyardee Ravioli.  I've tried asking for a spicy level of 11 on a scale of one to ten.  I've tried asking for \"traditional Indian\" heat.  No dice.  Chef Boyardee Vindaloo, every time.\n\nAnother problem is the take-out ordering process.  My wife and I have ordered take-out a couple times recently, and each time, we placed two orders for naan and only received one.  Since we live in Point Breeze, going back to the restaurant for $3 worth of naan isn't worth the effort, but really, we should have just received the naan in the first place.\n\nGiven these issues, why do we keep going back to Taste of India?  Simple: the biryani and korma are the best dishes this side of Stanwix Street.  And, that's saying quite a lot... or at least enough to keep this review at three stars instead of two.", "type": "review", "business_id": "LN3OCT1xOedbf65xKzFSNw"}

Now that we know, I have no doubt we will soon become regulars.\n\nWe have also tried Tamarind in Oakland, but that place just made my mouth go numb after it was all said and done (and left me with an unpleasant digestion experience).

My real yardstick for greatness, though is the samosas: when you order the special meal, they come along as part of the deal - it would be easy to take less care with a \"throwaway\" item, but they are quite simply the best samosas I have ever had, slightly spicy, super-crispy, and big enough to share.\n\nThe bill comes on a tiny tray filled with sugar crystals, caraway and coriander seeds and colorful bits of candy - I've seen similar combinations at other Indian restaurants, but it's artfully presented, and as with the rest of Taste of India, it leaves me charmed and satisfied, just as an excellent restaurant should.", "type": "review", "business_id": "LN3OCT1xOedbf65xKzFSNw"}

Absolutely LOVED it!\nThe BF and I went here over the weekend and it was wonderful. We started out with the chicken samosas. I would have probably preferred the traditional potato and pea, but the chicken was still delicious. Delicious enough that I finished mine first and kinda wanted to grab his and run out the door with it. For our entrees he got the Tandoori grill, which is basically an amazing array of MEAT! (when you see this plate, you'll understand why it cannot be called just 'meat'.) Now, I am by no means a vegetarian, but when we are taking Indian Cuisine, I usually opt for a veggie option. Simply because they are so good. While I can say his was a carnivore's delight I prefer something to accompany my MEAT! He suggested I get the Tikka Masala, so I did. Words cannot describe how much I loved this Masala. I would have to create a new word, like fanterrifayummuniciuos...ness. I wanted to lick the bowl, and then ask if I could lick the pot they made it in. He had the kheer for dessert. It was pretty good but I was still obsessing about the Masala, so I'm not sure I got the full effect. The service is mostly provided by an older Indian couple (I assumed the owned it) and is exemplary. Now, it was empty on a Saturday night, (which makes me nervous) so it should be exemplary, but quickly you realize that most of their business is take out. Eat in or Take out, but I would seriously try this place. \n*Although we did not get it, I would try the dinner for two.

Two gentlemen were seated and a lovely man with a thick Italian accent told us he could fit Mr. B in after his next cut. The place reminded me of a small shop that would be located on a tiny street in Naples. One chair running constantly. Tom the barber is very busy and you can see that his clientele is very loyal. The appointment was quick and the atmosphere jolly. The topics of conversation revolving around Italy and current events. I felt like an interloper because I was probably one of the only chicks that ever goes in there. I could tell by the looks I got from the guys coming in. I just smiled and kept up the conversation with Tom and Mr. B. This cut was very simple but he shaped the hair just perfect and when we walked outside I gave Mr. B a kiss and told him he looked marvelous!\n\nOur second visit was mid February. Mr. B was trying to go a little longer with the his hair but it was just looking unkempt. I decided that I liked his hair a little bit on the longer side so after calling and securing an appointment this visit, Mr. B asked my opinion after sitting in the chair. I told Tom I preferred the hair a little more full and not such a close cut. He smiled and kept up a nice chatter with the both of us. A steady stream of calls and locals walking in to make appointments again made the atmosphere so pleasant.  \n\nThis Hair cut was especially fantastic. Mr. B had such a dapper look, I loved the cut and gave him a big hug and kiss then told him how handsome he was. The pricing is also extremely fair. I want to jump up in that chair myself instead of going to yet another salon. Tom also remembered us from our first visit and that is just good people skills! Love, love, love the Golden razor. \n\n* Cash only and give this man a proper tip", "type": "review", "business_id": "CW4Qx9vk9D1o47Qgld5PLA"}

It's something like 24 wings for 8 bucks which is not a bad deal. There are definitely better wings around the city, but I still keep coming back to Nico's.

The location is great as it just pops up in the middle of a residential section in the heart of Bloomfield.\n\nThe patrons are always friendly, and on more than one occasion I've had random people start chatting me up like we've known each other for years.

Whether your voice is terrific, mediocre or terrible, there is a great crowd more than happy to make you feel as though your voice really is terrific.

I've found that Pittsburgh locals are super fun! I absolutely loved how everyone cheered the singers on during karaoke and sang along making it extremely comfortable to get up front and center! \n- Healthy food choices! Instead of having to worry about adding a ridiculous amount of calories (in addition to the crazy amount I had already consumed for the day)...it was nice to snack on some hummus, fresh tomatoes, feta cheese, and pita bread. \n- Very friendly DJ!\n- Bartenders were simply wonderful and always made sure you were taken care even with the enormous bar crowd.\n- Prices were very reasonable. I think I had six or seven captain and cokes (blush) and the platter for only $20?!\n\nDislikes: \n- POLLUTED AIR. I now have to take my jacket to the dry cleaner, thank you. \n- Location. There were no available taxis at any given time. We contacted two different taxi services and they never showed. We finally had a taxi pick us up after calling the hotel valet and asking them to send for us (I was a little desperate).\n- This place is very, very, very small. The karaoke room was closed off by 11 PM due to the room being so packed. If you were not in the karaoke room, you were smelling the person next to you's breath. \n\nAside the heavy smoke and tight spaces, I would recommend Nico's for a fun night of karaoke and cheap drinks with friends!", "type": "review", "business_id": "tQpYnf3P3Q_OQLYYJvlV-A"}

It's really easy to brush it off if you're walking by; from the outside it looks like a pretty standard bar. And when you walk in, it smells like a pretty typical bar - meaning that if this place ever closed, the next owner would have to rebuild the entire place to get the cigarette stench out. So yeah, I admit that my first impression was not a good one, and I actually thought to myself that if any more people showed up and started smoking I'd have to ask my friend to pick somewhere else for us to eat and talk.\n\nFortunately, between it being a Thursday, the snow and the bitter cold temperatures, very few people showed up and the majority of the smokers stuck to the main bar area. So I picked a booth in the far corner of the seating room and met up with my friend; while I waited for them I took a peak at the menu - nothing super spectacular, but the prices were pretty cheap overall. So hey, at we know this bar has cheap sandwiches and cheap burgers.\n\nOnce my friend arrived we both ordered some drinks, because of course you drink when you're in a place like Nico's. The beer and cider we ordered came in a glass and the original bottle respectively, and our water came out in plastic cups (something I'm admittedly not a big fan of - it's such a wasteful practice). We then split the fried zucchini and the recovery room pizza. The fried zucchini basket had four or five enormous stripes of zucchini and came with marinara sauce - it was quite tasty, although the sauce was pretty cold. Maybe it's just me, but I'd rather have warm marinara sauce than cold. The pizza, on the other hand, was absolutely delicious. The recovery room special is a specialty; it has gyro meat, feta cheese on top on regular cheese, mushrooms and green peppers. This was VERY good, and I'm sure the fact that they make the pizzas to-order was part of why I found it to be so yummy. And by the way, my friend and I both took some pizza home with us - it was an enormous meal and more than either of us needed. So don't let the prices on the pizza frighten you, they're worth it.\n\nThe good news is that overall my experience definitely got better as the night went on. The bad news is that I honestly don't think I'll go back to Nico's, at least not for quite a while. As delicious as the pizza was, nothing can make up for the fact that this place is a smoker's haven. With lungs as sensitive as mine, this is a dealbreaker, and I'm pretty sure it was only by pure chance that I came in on a night where no one was smoking near me; if the place had been any busier I'd've had to leave just so I could breathe normally, I'm sure. I'll still give the place an \"a-ok\" rating since the food was delicious, the prices were good, and our waiter (who I think was bar-tending as well) was very nice and very attentive overall. But with such a strong smoke smell an \"a-ok\" is all I can honestly give.", "type": "review", "business_id": "tQpYnf3P3Q_OQLYYJvlV-A"}

It's generally cheaper than the other Italian market nearby, Groceria Italiana (ex. the same half-gallon of milk was 30 cents cheaper at Donatelli's), and has more in terms of general grocery items, coffee (they sell Nicholas Coffee!), and snacks, so if you're looking to do a more extensive shopping trip, Donatelli's is probably recommended. My wife and I prefer Groceria italiana's pastas, desserts, and atmosphere, but we shop both on a regular basis. They're different enough to coexist, and both are good options!

Overall, I've been pleased with most of their products, the prices, and the customer service and atmosphere, hence the 4-star rating.\n\nAs others have mentioned, the space is rather cramped and chaotic, esp. during peak business hours (e.g., Sat. around noon, when I last stopped in).  The layout when you walk in is a bit strange, to the point that I inadvertently ended up behind the counter on my first visit.  (Stay to the left and you won't have this problem.)  The most crowded section of the store is the deli counter, where you can obtain not only meats and cheeses, but a variety of made-to-order sandwiches and sides.  If you visit the deli counter during peak hours and are feeling indecisive, take a number right away--trust me, you'll have plenty of time to decide what to get as others are being helped.\n\nAs for the grocery products, there is enough variety that you can find several versions of most Italian ingredients you'll need here, as well as other general grocery items like milk and ice cream. In general, prices are very reasonable-- generally less expensive than Groceria Italiana.  Unlike Groceria Italiana, a good portion of the product consists of commercially-available brands--albeit many that you wouldn't encounter in a mainstream grocery store like Giant Eagle. Having said that, the main attraction for me is the made-in-house items, such as the fresh pasta, the sauces, and the biscotti, as well as the hot meals.\n\nIn the interest of brevity, here is a list of products I've bought at Donatelli's, followed by price, recommendation, and comments:\n\nGrandma's plain sauce ($3.65): Recommended--Better flavor and seasoning than commercial jarred sauces (e.g., Ragu, etc.)  Also, I like that Donatelli's makes meatless red sauce, unlike Groceria Italiana, since I don't eat beef.\n\nLobster ravioli ($9.99): Not recommended--After following boiling directions (necessary to avoid curdling cream sauce via baking), pasta was good, but filling was mushy.  Also, included imitation crabmeat, and I'm not a fan of imitation foods.  I'll be sticking to Groceria Italiana's handmade ravioli from now on.\n\nRicotta pie ($5.49): Recommended--Though this was my first time trying it, I was favorably impressed with the flavor and texture.\n\nBiscotti ($3.52): Recommended--I've only had the spumoni biscotti (a flavor I haven't seen elsewhere), but it tasted fresh and was good.\n\nItalian bread ($1.50): Recommended--Soft and fresh, and inexpensive\n\nHot food from deli counter: Recommended--I had the half pound fish sandwich ($2.49) and a half pound of the white cheddar bake ($2.99), and both were very good.  Notably, the roll was proportional to the fish, so the sandwich didn't fall apart, as is common at other PGH eateries serving fish sandwiches.\n\nDespite how hectic Donatelli's can be during peak hours, I've been impressed at the friendly service that I've received at the deli counter and checkout.  If there's one drawback, it's that waits at both counters are inevitable during these times.  Of course, if your schedule permits, this problem can be avoided by simply visiting at non-peak times.\n\nWhile Donatelli's may feel kind of cramped and may not seem as immaculately clean as some big box grocery stores (at least for the section the customer sees), this is part of its charm as a neighborhood ethnic grocery store.  I'll definitely continue stopping in for certain Italian grocery items, such as the plain sauce, biscotti, and bread, as well as for inexpensive, delicious hot lunch items.", "type": "review", "business_id": "KH6stvNdq_aV0HvKw8P5yA"}

Jeanie does swear like a sailor, but in a quiet mild manner and NOT like a raging lunatic.  When you come here you will have to except every swear word constantly flowing from her mouth.

We made a reservation for seven of us, but there was no need to call ahead - the place was empty except for a man sitting at the bar, and a couple of girls at another table across the room.  Definitely not hoppin'.  The color of the walls and the decor remind me of a hotel restaurant that only serves a breakfast buffet.  It's very quiet in there, except for the low noises from a TV showing a football game in the next room.\n\nOur server was definitely \"set in her ways,\" as one of my coworkers said.  She had a routine in terms of when she took drink orders, when she took food orders, when she brought the check.  Deviations in the schedule seemed to cause a \"does not compute\" response across her face....like when I sat down and she asked what I wanted to drink.  I said I was going to wait until my next coworker arrived (thinking she might want to share some wine with me), and she was just like \"...you want to wait?  to order something to drink...?\" and I was all \"yes, I just got here....I don't even know what I want!\" and she looked so confused, like how could some idiot like me possibly not know what they wanted to drink - finally she was like \"oh, do you need a list or something?\"  I know, I'm one of those difficult customers who requires a wine list in order to determine what wine I plan to order.  I'm weird like that.  Trying to order food at the same time as drinks was also a no-go.  You have to play by her rules.  When we did figure out the complicated drink-ordering situation, my coworker and I enjoyed our half-carafe of chardonnay.  I'd recommend getting a half carafe - the wine glasses are so small, paying $6 for a glass is a total rip off.  Get a half or full carafe and get your money's worth.\n\nThe entrees come with soup and salad, which seems really old-school and kind of awesome to me.  They had one kind of soup, so you get what you get.  It was a chicken-vegetable-tortellini soup served in a little cup.  I liked it, because I like thin, brothy soups, but it wasn't anything special.  The four little tortellinis floating around were the best part, and it was nice to have some veggies too.  Salad was standard iceberg lettuce, carrot shreds, some tinny-tasting black olives, and the acidic but not-bad strawberry vinaigrette that came on the side.  I didn't bother with the bread - it didn't look like anything special and it just came with butter packets.\n\nI got the pasta roll for my entree.  Despite having lots of ingredients (pasta, spinach, prosciutto, pine nuts, sambuca, tomato cream sauce, probably some cheese somewhere), the dish was surprisingly one note.  I didn't think it was well-seasoned - I ended up pouring red pepper flakes on top to give it a zing, which didn't help terribly.  The texture was good, and it was a cool idea, and it wasn't a BAD dish, but it was just...meh.  Nothing exciting.  Very average.  Pretty bland.  I tasted a few other people's dishes and my response was the same.  It's just generic stuff.  Like I said, Olive Garden, only local.  Considering how \"meh\" the food was, I think it's way overpriced.\n\nSo I wouldn't go back.  It's not my kind of food, or place.

The other day someone asked me... where's your favourite Vietnamese food? I told them that I didn't know which was my favourite, but I could tell you which was my least favourite: Tram's. \n\nI don't even care about the decor or seating etc. Usually the best Vietnamese comes from fairly sketchy looking joints. \n\nI had their \"Special\" noodle bowl which is their version of Bun thit nuong. It looked a mess. The spring rolls were cut up brutally and then everything was tossed in. Usually when you order this at other place, it doesn't come \"pre-mixed.\" Honestly, it looked like someone had already starting eating this. I thought to myself... \"Okay they have a different presentation style.\" \n\nBut as I ate, I was even more disappointed. They hardly put any fresh vegetables in it, and the vermicelli is overcooked. The spring rolls were completely soggy. \n\nI don't think their menu is limited though, it seemed fairly typical. I don't know, maybe their Pho is better, but I'm already too disappointed to come back.\n\nAfter reading other people's reviews and trying other Vietnamese places around the city and then having Vietnamese food in Toronto(at an average place), I'm throughly convinced that people in this city have no idea what Vietnamese food is supposed to taste like.\n\nOh and one last thing... do you actually believe that their food is vegetarian?

I moved to Pittsburgh from Seattle where you can find some of the absolute best Vietnamese food.  This place is a hole-in-the-wall with a very brusque owner/waiter and kind of dingy decor.  I don't mind any of these things actually, but the food I definitely took some issue with.  I ordered a tofu-veggie dish (can't remember the name) served over rice.  My boyfriend ordered the pork rice vermicelli bowl.  Our food came fast enough and it was served hot.  However, my dish was nothing to brag about.  It was pretty average tasting Asian fare.  It didn't taste bad by any means, but not restaurant quality.  Good thing it was only about 6 bucks.  My boyfriend's dinner was a real disappointment, however.  My favorite Vietnamese restaurant in Seattle had HUGE vermicelli bowls with absolutely fresh lettuce and onions, piled high on top of perfectly cooked noodles.  The meat/tofu you ordered with it was never sparse and it was cooked to perfection.  Everything was doused with some sweet fish sauce and presented with some sliced egg roll.  The pork vermicelli that came to my table did not resemble this at all.  It was served in a rather small bowl with just a few pieces of lettuce and onion.  The \"pork\" that was on top amounted to about 1/4 of a cup of weird texturized, shredded something.  It almost looked like boiled ground beef.  I felt sorry for my boyfriend because he had never eaten Vietnamese food before and I had recommended a vermicelli dish to him because they are (usually) delicious.  As a double whammy, his dish was about 9 dollars!  Neither of us were full when we were done with our meals, so we ordered some spring rolls, which were supposed to be what they are famous for.  I don't understand this either.  The rolls were extremely bland and chewy.  The sauce that was served with it didn't do much to save it.  Overall, I wouldn't recommend this place and I will continue my search for good Vietnamese food elsewhere.  Also, please take note they only accept cash and no cards.", "type": "review", "business_id": "dxCqGkhtXq-9fYEsX7Mf6Q"}

I think I can help explain this issue.\n\nTram's has a fairly full menu, but there are two things on the menu that you should be ordering:  the soups (particularly, the beef pho) and the fresh spring rolls.  That's it.\n\nIf you've had Pho in other cities, you might not understand Tram's.  There's no Vietnamese community in Pittsburgh, so you can't get all the trimmings you might have come to expect:   no tripe, no tendon, no other strange meat parts. Just beef or chicken.  But what sets Tram's apart, in my view, is the quality of his broth.  I have eaten Pho all around the US, and Tram's broth is, in my view, the very best I've had.\n\nSo get the pho (or, if you're in the mood for something different, the Saigon Soup), get the spring rolls, and skip everything else on the menu.  Then you'll understand Tram's.\n\nIncidentally, the owner's name is not \"Tram\".  His name is Le Thao.

So off I went in search of Tram's.\n\nTram's is located in a section of Pittsburgh that is a little on the run down side - the area has seen better days. But that did not phase me - adds some character to the place!\n\nIt was about 1:45 pm when I rolled in. Was given a choice of where to sit  - a little old man with one arm (or perhaps he was missing just the hand? - could not tell) took my order. He did not seem to friendly - I asked him a couple of questions and it was hard to get anything out of him.\n\nI ordered Pho Ga with white meat (although their menu lists it as \"Pho Hanoi\") with garden rolls and a glass of water.\n\nI suspected that perhaps their approach to Pho was going to be more Northern Vietnam based on the name for the soup - and I was partially correct. When the soup came out - the noodles were the slightly wider ones rather than the very thin ones.\n\nNow I'm guessing that many of my Yelp friends from the DC area that like Pho would not have liked the Pho here.  Unless I'm mistaken - most of you folks seem to prefer to have all of the fat skimmed and strained out of your Pho broth - which I am against. It makes the broth to clear and light and there is a significant reduction in flavor and richness when this is done. And they certainly weren't doing that here. In fact - there was a slight oiliness or greasiness to the broth - but not overly so. It gave the broth a delicious richness and subtly in flavor that was just so damn good!\n\nI added all of the aromatics and veggies. I will say that the amount of Basil, and the quality of the Basil were the low points of the meal. The poor Basil had seen better days.\n\nI then tasted the broth and was floored by how good it was. I detected light, rich hints of star anise and cinnamon, which when combined with chicken essence fat globules and onions - was just outstanding. Rich, savory, wonderful!\n\nI added Sriracha sauce to individual bites of food as I went - and only added a little to the broth at the very end. I really wanted to savor the broth the way it was.\n\nCons:\n- The rolls were not very fresh - in fact I did not finish them because they weren't very good.\n- The Basil was not crisp and fresh\n- The restrooms need to be gutted and retrofitted\n\nSo I'm only docking them one star for the cons - the Pho was outstanding IMHO - so four stars overall!\n\nCash only - no credit cards.

Did Tram's have all but a corner on the market at the time? Sure. Would people return if it was terrible? I would hope not. \n\nAs for the food, I am no student of Vietnamese cuisine, but the bun, or as it's billed here: \"grilled meat (why they don't just call it pork is a mystery, perhaps they're leaving their options open?) over vermicelli\" (pronounced \"ver-miss-eh-lee,\" by our esteemed host) is tasty and filling, as are the spring rolls.

Inside I didn't expect much, tablecloths were vinyl and chairs with uneven stands.  All I care about was the authenticity of the food & cost for what it's worth.\n\nI started my meal with an appetizer of Goi Cuon with shrimp.  I was highly disappointing when disecting what was in it.  There was 1 shrimp cut in half lengthwise, mainly bun (rice noodle) for fillers along with a few strands of beansprouts & lettuce to make it look presentable.  I quickly devoured the tiny appetizer in 2 bites.  My main entree was Pho Ha Noi.  It took forever for the food to arrive, it was a big bowl.  Until I stirred it around to find out it was mainly broth and green onions.  The broth was flavorless, actually it didn't have any flavor; so I had to add hoisin sause to give it a little of whatever to go along with the sliced pork.  I was confused about the noodle itself, Pho is usually served with flat vermicelli noodle; but this Pho Ha Noi was served with round vermicelli noodles usually for Bun Bo entree.  I asked the old man with the amputated arm, why it was served with bun (round rice noodle) instead of pho (flat rice noodle) noodles, he laughed and insisted it was pho (flat rice noodle).  Ok I may be young but I wasnt born yesterday, I think I know my pho noodle and sorry it wasn't.  \n\nNext visit to the 'burgh, I think I'll try Pho Minh & see how their PHO compares to Tram's Kitchen.

I'm still happy to go there and get a sandwich since its the only Vietnamese place that offers a vege Vietnamese sandwich that I could find.", "type": "review", "business_id": "e9nN4XxjdHj4qtKCOPq_vg"}

Well, after a visit to Lee's I will from now on.

They even have a ham/cheese croissant that hits the spot perfectly in the morning. I like to accompany mine with a Lee's coffee, which to be honest I dont really know what it is. Some kind of iced-sweet-latte-goodness. If you're in the mood for a larger breakfast they offer four different types of egg/meat/croissant sandwiches too. \n\nIf you happen to stop in during lunch there are over 20 different sandwiches to choose from. Some are basic turkey and ham. The others have more of a...uh...Vietnamese flare to them. All are about $6 and come on your choice of a baguette or croissant (my four star rating is mostly due to the fact that the meat is a little stingy). After lunch you can crave that sweet tooth with some ice cream or a smoothy. \n\nOne thing you will notice about Lee's is its cleanliness! Always immaculate. I dont know how they manage it but it has to be the easiest stop on the health inspectors route. Pop in late in the day if you want some cheap day old bread, which is still pretty great.\n\n*One more thing- Be sure to bring cash!!

Its strong, sweet and a great way to kick your OCD into high gear for just $2.50. I would like to say that it energized my morning, but really it game me an adrenaline shot so powerful that I couldn't fully do anything that required even an ounce of concentration. I may have had a minor twitch later, but the taste of that coffee made it all worth it.\n\nNow I did my homework and I did exactly what yelp suggested: I got the grilled pork sandwich with extra meat. Maybe that was my mistake, listening to Yelp (You're not the boss of me!). The sandwich definitely had tons of meat, but the quality of the pork was very iffy. I almost don't want to know what part of the pig I was eating, it felt that questionable. The jalapenos were great but I couldn't taste much of the pickled veggies- probably my fault for getting the extra pork. There was no crunch, no sourness in the picking, no real Bahn Mi flavors. it was a delicious baguette with mystery meat. The size and pricing were spectacular, I just wasn't sold on the flavor.\n\nI still have hope for a place with such low prices, and hefty Yelp support.

The bread the sandwiches are served on is special. Its creamy, flavorful, soft on the inside, slightly crisp on the outside. The meats inside are very good but they take second stage to the bread in my opinion. My mom complains that they skimp on the fillings but I didn't find that to be the case for me. A sandwich with bread that good would be overwhelmed by too much meat. For me, I felt the sandwich was balanced perfectly with the right amount of meat, pickled veggies, cilantro, and jalapeno.\n\nOf course, we ordered the iced coffees which hit the spot and got us energized for our long afternoon.

I love their pickled daikon and carrots, the pate spread, the headcheese, fresh cilantro, spicy jalapenos, and the cold cuts selection here.  No matter the arrangement, it's always delicious.  There's really no such thing as a bad banh mi at Lee's!\n\nLee's Sandwiches also sells ice cream, Deli Manjoo Cakes at their own little kiosk, and hot pastries.  The pork pate chaud is one of my favorite things to get.  It's a tiny meatball inside layers of flaky crust.  Yum!  If you need  some pure caffeine on long torturous days, I recommend the Vietnamese iced coffee.  That stuff is strong.  For a sweeter beverage, I reach for their sugarcane juice.  \n\nRemember to bring cash or risk using their sketchy ATM machine.  It's seriously suspect.\n\n*** Featured in The Weekly Yelp, January 28, 2015 - Sandwiches: The Best Thing Since Sliced Bread", "type": "review", "business_id": "e9nN4XxjdHj4qtKCOPq_vg"}

For the timid, all your favorite Sysco near-meat products are available on baguette or croissant. In addition to sandwiches, they have a small variety of Asian-street-foody options, many blended and mixed (soft) drinks, ice cream, and a dozen variations on the ever-popular highly-caffeinated Vietnamese coffee. \n\nOccasionally it smells faintly like cat pee, but that seems to coincide with the appearance of a fresh batch of durian ice cream.

It was a rainy day and it just seemed like the right type of food and to down it with a boba drink.\n\nThought about treating my mechanic and his helper and I thought my husband would like this.  And I know my kids already like this, and they were starting to eat solid food again from being sick the past week.\n\nOrdered 3 grilled pork Banh Mi's, 2 grilled chicken and a roast beef croissant sandwich and 2 orders of 5 pork & shrimp egg rolls.  There was nobody ordering at the time we ordered and the lull of any lunch rush was over.\n\nThe Banh Mi's were very reasonably priced at $3.49 and it's quite a lot for a sandwich.  The egg rolls, I thought, were a little pricey at $3.99 for 5 Vietnamese style egg rolls (deep fried), but the sandwich price made up for this.  I can't remember how much the small croissant sandwich was, but I think that was close to $5 and it wasn't very big.\n\nSo the deal is to get a Banh Mi, but my son wasn't up to eating that much and needed something softer.  All that came to about $31-32, which that's food for 6 people's lunches, so not bad.\n\nIt took probably 15 minutes to make the order, which the egg rolls were already prepared, so I thought it took a bit more time.  I didn't know that the Banh Mi wrappers indicated what sandwich it was.\n\nThe guy that took my order is Latino, which isn't a big deal.  I think the guy making the stuff was Asian.  Oh, and make sure you bring cash.  They do not take credit or debit cards and there is a machine for you to get cash, but there is a $1.75 charge.  I wish they had this as a sign on the front door - CASH ONLY!  \n\nNext time I will know.  That was why I gave it a 4 star, but really, it only deserves a 1/2 star knock down for that, not a full star.  But, since I'm Asian, I should know that some Asian places only do cash.  Okay, heck, I'll give them 5 stars.\n\nWe'd go again.  Everyone that I got the sandwiches for liked them.  The baguette was perfect - somewhat toasted on the outside and slightly soft on the inside.  The grilled pork was very tasty and just enough of the veggies, not too much.  Just the right amounts of meat and veggies.\n\nMy mechanic and his helper had the grilled chicken Banh Mi and they loved it.

Yes.  Their coffee, yes.  Their pastries, sure. \n\nBut this review is based off of a recent experience with their (new?) breakfast sandwich.  Not sure how long they've had breakfast sandwiches on their menu but this was the first time seeing the option since I was last there.\n\nSo I came in for breakfast and I ordered a pate chaud and an almond croissant, so that didn't require any waiting.  My boyfriend on the other hand, decided to try their bacon/egg/cheese breakfast croissant.  After ten minutes of waiting, I was getting rather hungry so I started to eat my pastries.  5 - 7 minutes later after I ate my stuff, the breakfast sandwich still did not come out.  This was a 15-17 minute wait already, and the shop was not even busy.  Imagine sitting there hearing number after number being called (EXCEPT YOURS), and looking at people who came in 15 mins after you did, eating their food.  And you are just sitting there wondering where your shit is.  So we get up, walk up to the window and ask where our sandwich is.  The guy at the window states it should be coming out \"soon\" and the wait is due to the fact that the eggs are being made in the back of the kitchen.  Look, if you can't fry a damn egg in under 5 minutes, there is seriously something wrong with you.  If I were the manager, I'd either implement a training on how to efficiently cook an egg or just hire someone else who is more efficient, OR teach your employee to come up with better excuses. \n\nAfter being told the sandwich is coming out \"soon\", we waited another 10-12 minutes.  I want to stress that I am not being dramatic about this, as there was another couple who ordered the same thing we did and were waiting a long time as well.  Frustrated, we asked for our money back and were subsequently told AGAIN that \"your sandwich is coming out soon.\" I decided that if \"SOON\" was not 3 mins or less, I'd go ghetto on their ass.  Luckily for them, the sandwich came up a couple minutes after that.  I made it a point to check in front of the employee's face to see if the sandwich was piping hot, which it was, but that only proves the sandwich was recently made.  \n\nLesson of the day for anyone working in the restaurant industry?  If you forgot someones food, just admit it and apologize.  Don't lie to me.  It doesn't take 30 minutes to put egg, bacon and cheese in between a croissant and heat it up.  The sandwich, I kid you not, was 4x4 in size, with 2 pieces of bacon, some cheese and an omelette style egg. Definitely NOT worth a 30 minute wait, especially in a fast food joint.  We should've just went to McDonalds across the street.  \n\nIf I have to stand there and stare you down and make sure that you are making my food, I probably won't come back.", "type": "review", "business_id": "e9nN4XxjdHj4qtKCOPq_vg"}

My honey can eat like 10 of them. You can get 20 for $14.99, or 5 for $3.99\n\nTheir \"lee's coffee\" which is coffee with sweetened condensed milk is nothing less than amazing. So yummy. \n\nRecently they started carrying macarons. Best decision ever. I tried the green tea macaron. It was perfect. The matcha was balanced perfectly in the filling and macaron, which a lot of places fail at.\n\nWord of advice? It's cash only. Always bring cash. Their ATM was out of service this time. I had to go to Walgreens next door, and their ATM was out of service too. It wasn't a huge deal, but that was kind of annoying. The limit for cash back at Walgreens was $20, and I really wanted to buy a ton of egg rolls to bring home.", "type": "review", "business_id": "e9nN4XxjdHj4qtKCOPq_vg"}

It was only a year ago that I would have awarded this restaurant the coveted 5 star rating. But ever since Howard Seftel gave Golden Buddha such a glowing review in the Arizona Republic this establishment has gone downhill drastically. \n\nIt's almost as if the said \"Screw it! We got our good review so now we can put away all the quality ingredients, cease polite and speedy service and basically charge everything that made this place good.\" \n\nI LOVE dim sum so despite the deteriortating conditions I still eat here a lot. But I don't have to be happy about it, do I?\n\nAnd now it IS pretty bad. It starts at the host stand. I hate to call them out, but if there is a wait, they seat Asian people before Whitey!!! I actually sat and observed this on more than one occasion. I'm all for giving a little preferential treatment to your friends and family but there is no way the guy at the front knows every single Asian in town. \n\nI love dim sum so I wait.\n\nThe dim sum carts rarely come around. When they do come around they are filled with the same sparse selection of items.  The whole idea behind dim sum is variety so I wish they would provide a more diverse selection. The stuff they do put out is often cold and limp. This is because they circulate the same stuff round and round again until it's gone. I understand they don't want to waste food, but there comes a certain point where it's over. You just can't serve egg rolls that are cold and hard as a rock. Isn't that a health code violation?\n\nI also wish they kept sauce on the table like other Chinese restaurants. Here they only keep watered down chili paste/oil blend (worst quality available) and really salty soy sauce. Most places also make mustard and sweet sauce available. If you ask for said sauces at Golden Buddha they squeeze one dollop into a container the size of my thumb - for everyone in your entire party to share! Party on one? One dollap! Party of three? One dollap! Party of nineteen? One dollap!!!\n\nThe universal sauce bottle is kept on a podium next to the dirty dish rags, incidentally. The to-go boxes are stacked here too.\n\nI went here for dinner once. I tried to order an appetizer before my dinner and the manager/waiter guy said 'NO! You must order everything at the same time!\" I tried to tell him that I wasn't sure what I wanted for dinner yet, but I'd like to start with some pot stickers and he repeated \"No! You must order together.\" Then he mumbled something about the kitchen being too confused for two separate orders from one table. I was dumb founded.  \n\nThis is the place the Arizona Republic gives top awards??? I think it's time for another visit Howie.\n\nI don't know if new management took over or what, but if they keep going down this path of cheap ingredients, no selection and poor service they will lose me forever. Which sucks because I hate to drive to Chandler for dim sum when there should be some great dumplings right in my own backyard. I should give it only 2 stars, but I'm a sucker for any dim sum, no matter how crappy, salty or cold it is.\n\nShape up Golden Buddha!

If you are \"craving\" dim sum, go elsewhere (take a 5 hour drive west to neighboring state, California).\n\nAnyway, I've been visiting Golden Buddha in the noontime for roughly 2 years now. I believe they moved from their original site (7th St. & Osborn), formerly \"China Doll.\" Relocation brought along better atmosphere and smiling faces. This does not mean, better dim sum. But since we are in Phoenix, I will settle for what they have to offer. \n\nBe mindful of the dim sum tab. It's itemized high-medium-low. \n\nShaomai can be found as combinations of pork/mushroom, shrimp, or shark fin (which should not be confused as true shark bits, as the shaomai is prepared to look like a shark's fin). These picks are okay...perhaps on a better day shao mai will be served in less-rigid, or fresher wrappers. Potstickers are okay as well, just the usual scallion and pork, and dry wrapper. The baby pork ribs in light black bean sauce and jalapenos is alright, but sometimes lacks in taste. Tripe is also served in its bare minimum...so if you enjoy the texture and flavor of tripe, try this with its clear sauce and thinly sliced carrots and celery.  \nBuche (that's what I call it), or fried sesame balls are also available, although if you wait until dessert, they will also be a bit stiff. There are a few other things that may be \"spotted\" but are not worth mentioning. \n\nDon't order from their lunch menu, as you can find these over-salted dishes at Panda Express anyway. \n\nOverall, dim sum at Golden Buddha is a place to go if you are around the vicinity and feel like having something apart from the usual fast food.

When we looked into the kitchen, we saw a Chinese woman doing most of the cooking herself.  No wonder it took forever for a cart to come out and when it does, it's swarmed on by a pack of vultures.\n\nIf you're willing to eat at a more simply decorated place with a smaller menu, I'd highly recommend China Chan.

Can I break the mold or am I to going to be a crotchety sourpuss?\n\nSo as I contemplate and figure out what I'm going to do with my birthday baggage I decide to squash it with food.

So why not dim sum? \n\nIve chowed much dim sum in my 36 years of earthen wear.. of course some good and some bad. I have never been to a place where every dish was great.. Golden Buddha is no exception to this.. they do the basics well enough and have enough funky cool Asian style to keep me interested in returning. The carts around 1130 flow well but around noon it' s full blown freeway action! In fact there might be some road kill in there based on some of the looks on that last steam cart.. \n\nMe and 3 others who were feeling my pain ordered 14, count them, 14 different dishes. One of my friends is from Georgia and had never had dim sum but he is so courageous and unflinching that he was just a blast. Just the shot in the arm to get me out of my funk. I remember the first time I had dim sum.. my eyes wide open, nostrils flared and excited to see what was under the next steamer lid. That was him today.. one exciting thing after the next.. he was even willing to try chicken feet but this is one of those dishes not done very well here. \n\nMy friend took me back to a time where I was younger and less experienced. He looked up to me to guide him through the noodles, bao and sui mai.. like a big brother.. I'm privileged that I could show him something new and exciting and he was so into it! So instead of feeling sorry for myself I felt experienced and useful.. that there is something I can give back to others.. that its not all about me and me aging but about what can be shared with others.\n\nThere is so much more to do, give and feel in this short time we are here.. and Ill do it to, one bite at a time.", "type": "review", "business_id": "jbKVbSz51F8IcewsiRQu4A"}

I spent most of my childhood weekends in Chinatown. I know what it is to go to Dim-Sum on a weekend amidst a shouting hoard of Chinese people who all sound like they are arguing, but are really just having polite conversation. That being said, I've never been to this restaurant on a weekend, and probably wouldn't recommend it unless you are already hard-of-hearing.\n\nAnyway. This place is the most authentic Chinese restaurant I've seen outside of L.A. They have several carts circulating throughout the dining area from which you can select from a wide array of various Chinese fare. It's sort of like a Chinese appetizer buffet. However, keep in mind that you pay for each dish, and some are more expensive than others. From what I could tell, the prices for each dish range from about $3 to $7 and up. You can select from Shark Fin dumplings (very tasty) to Spring Rolls to Chicken buns to Chicken Feet (this, I don't recommend) and so on and so forth. I don't know the name of my favorite dish (I never did learn Chinese), but it comes on an oblong plate and the best way I can describe it is a rice roll with meat inside. I heartily recommend the shrimp or BBQ pork. Many of the servers speak little or no English, so if they recognize you as a non-Asian they will simply smile and lift up all the lids for you to see what's inside the dishes they have available. So don't be afraid if you don't have a Chinese-speaking person with you. Be brave, try something new...", "type": "review", "business_id": "jbKVbSz51F8IcewsiRQu4A"}

I recently attended a banquet at the Golden Buddah and I was shocked at the level of quality of food and service.  Of the 10 dishes served 4 were nearly inedible.  \n\nThere was a crab claw appetizer, most chinese restaurants prepare this dish by taking a crab claw surrounding it with ground shrimp, batter and then deep fry.  At Golden Buddah, the crab claw served was mostly batter.  \n\nThe shark fin soup served was mostly broth.  Shark fin is an expensive ingredient and most places usually use imitation shark fin, but come on at least put something in there so that I know I'm eating soup and not dirty sink water.  \n\nGinger scallion lobster is battered, fried, and then stir fried in a sauce with ginger and scallions.  The ginger scallion lobster served was over-cooked and dried out.  \n\nLastly, there was a steamed fish.  The fish was raw in the middle.   \n\nIt wasn't all bad, there was a crispy chicken with garlic dish that was pretty good, but out of 10 dishes 4 were bad, 5 were okay, and 1 was good.  \n\nDoes 4 bad dishes out of 10 warrant a one star rating?  Well it does when you factor in the service.  The soup, appetizer, and first entree arrived timely, but after that there was a 1 hour gap before we received the next dish.

We started off with the shrimp egg rolls which were more like the thin fried spring rolls. The eggrolls and shrimp inside were tasty and not overly greasy at all.

The restaurant was very busy so service was a little slow and we actually enjoyed that our meals did not come out at the same time since we were sharing anyway. \n\nThe first one to arrive was shrimp with walnuts. The shrimp had a sweet crisp coating and had some type of mayonaise/tarter type light sauce which I didn't care for but loved the taste of the shrimp without the sauce. They were nice and light. The shrimp came on top of crisp puffy rice noodles of a type (don't know what they are called). Slices of canned peaches came with it as well. \n\nThe next two to arrive were the pan fried eggplant stuffed with minced shrimp with garlic sauce and vegetable lomein.  The eggplant stuffed with shrimp were very tasty.The shrimp in between the eggplant slices had a fried outside and inside were soft (not individual shrimp but minced shrimp combined into a sort of shrimp cake of sorts). The sauce was light but delicious and the eggplant were very soft. I really liked this dish though would probably get the vegetarian version without the shrimp next time.\n\nThe vegetable lomein was delicious. Nice and light - not overly greasy at all and with a good amount of fresh vegetables. This was delicious as well. \n\nThe pots of tea were nice as well.\n\n\nThe price was about a little over $40 for three entrees, the eggrolls  and a pot of tea. \n\n\nOverall we very much enjoyed the meal and will definitely return.", "type": "review", "business_id": "jbKVbSz51F8IcewsiRQu4A"}

There are actually several dim sum alternatives in the valley, and I've tried two for comparison.  \n\nThis is a lovely restaurant, with a nautical theme. It is NOT gaudy, tacky or overdone.   My super-spicy friend, who works in construction, remarked on the beauty of the natural woodwork (the bar counter is subtly shaped like a to-scale sized long boat), clean marble floors, and well laid out dining areas and private banquet rooms.  I like the huge picture windows, natural lighting and view of a beautiful Asian garden (part of the Chinese Cultural Center complex).  In fact, I'd suggest a walk through the garden either before or after eating.  . \n\nI'm not very adventurous, I always get har gow (steamed shrimp in a delicate rice skin wrapper), char siew bao (steamed buns filled with very tender tasty BBQ pork cubes), cooked greens in light brown gravy (I think they are Chinese broccoli or rapeseed, look like long thin stalks of broccoli, very fresh and green), shu mai (dainty dumplings filled with chopped meat and a bit of carrot) and stir-fry vermicelli (semolina-type, not rice noodles).  The filled folded flat noodles (these ones ARE rice!) are velvety and prepared correctly, but too bland and slippery for me personally. \n\nMy spicy friend has tried most everything else, says these dishes are good: short spare ribs, fried turnip/ radish squares, lean sliver-sliced pork, crispy spring rolls, flavored riced with minced meat and vegetables under glass bowl, tripe bowl, rice wrapped in a big leaf, and sweet custard mini-pastries.  Pass on the coconut-flavored gelatin dessert, hot dog wrapped in light  pastry (note that most kids like that one) and chicken feet.  He says China King does Chicken feet better, breaded and crisp. GB's are chewy and not a good value.\n\nThe waitstaff don't all speak the best English, but that is the case at many restaurants. While they may seem brusque, I've never had any problem getting what I want. The maitre'd IS fluent in English, as well as friendly and helpful.\n\nImportant caveat: this review pertains to dim sum on Saturday and Sunday ONLY!  Monday through Friday, it is a pale shadow of its weekend self, although ordering from the menu might be just fine.  Note too that dim sum is served, or rather trundled by on carts, from 11am to 2pm only.  I'd suggest arriving around 11:30am or noon.  Although it will be crowded, there will be the most variety of dim sum choices.  \n\nFinal comment: I haven't ordered from the menu, but my mother gets those old stand-bys, Moo Gai Pan and Wor Wonton Noodle soup, and both are decent.", "type": "review", "business_id": "jbKVbSz51F8IcewsiRQu4A"}

I love spending time leisurely reading the Sunday news while getting caught up on a weeks worth of cooking shows. After a few hours hunger finally sets in and its time to find something cheap and easy. While that might sound more like a lifestyle choice than a way of eating, cheap and easy to me means dim sum, and lots of it. With a fistful of cash and my growing appetite I head over to my default dim sum house, Golden Buddha. \n\nLocated in the Chinese Cultural Center, Golden Buddha has been pushing carts every weekend for the past few years. Over those years they've become a destination for steamy delights and have built quite a following with groups usually packing the lobby. Here's some advice, for a lesser selection with no waiting, go early. If you want more selection and don't mind the wait, go after noon. \n\nRanging in price from $2.35-$6.50, Golden Buddha pretty much offers mainstream selections from dumplings and chicken feet to rice and noodles. Most of the cart pushers don't speak much English but know this; most items are either made with pork or shrimp. \n\nWithin minutes of being sat the first smiling server rolls up her cart and begins pimping her wares. As she lifts the steel lid from the first steam basket, the mist dissipates to reveal 3 white fluffy hidden treasures beneath. Know as char siu bao, or steamed BBQ pork buns, these are pretty standard for any dim sum brunch. Pulling apart one of the doughy pillows reveals its sweet porky center, add some chile oil for added depth. Probably the most typical offering is the pork dumplings or sui mai, a wonton wrapper filled with ground pork and black mushrooms. These meaty bites have an enjoyable earthiness that left me wanting to ask for another basket.\n\nThe next cart to come along is absolutely filled with fried items. I love the crispy crunch of egg rolls and while the GB version was crisp, the inside was filled with oil that tasted like last nights fish. After only a single bite the rest remained untouched. Seemingly fried in the same oil, the salt and pepper shrimp were not only super fishy but the shells were also left on. Shell on shrimp isn't usually a problem when the shrimp in question is cooked really well. Not the case with these, they were ruined before they even hit the table, greasy and salty.\n\nOn a lighter note, wrapped in translucent rice paper, the spring rolls were large, filled with chewy rice noodles and 3 plump shrimp, unfortunately these were also flavorless. \n\nA new one for me was the Zhaliang, a long tubular Chinese doughnut that is tightly cocooned in a sheet of rice noodle. The end result is more about texture than bold flavor; I can see how so many people seek these out for breakfast being chewy and crispy at the same time. \n\nDim sum brunch isn't complete without at least one Chinese dessert. Pointing at a plate of pineapple buns or bo lo yau from the dessert cart, these pastries actually contain no pineapple. Instead the name refers to its crunchy checkered top crust. Inside the bun you'll get a sweet surprise of satisfyingly sweet custard filling.\n\nWhile I left satisfied, overall Golden Buddha doesn't quite have the chops they used to, but in a pinch or on a lazy Sunday morning, they'll do just fine.", "type": "review", "business_id": "jbKVbSz51F8IcewsiRQu4A"}

Since leaving Nor. Cal. I've been craving dim sum, and after seeing all the yelp reviews, thought it was worth a try.\n\nIt was OK.  That's sort of the most I can say.  The selection was decent. We had shrimp noodles, which were well seasoned and had good texture, but the pork dumplings, steamed pork buns, and egg rolls were relatively bland. The sticky rice in banana leaf was just okay too - it had three different kinds of meat, all of which were seasoned differently. There were no vegetables available during the week, except if ordered from the menu.  I would have liked a better selection of dim sum choices.\n\nThat being said, the wait staff was very friendly and not pushy at all - though if you aren't good at saying no, I can see where you might end up with more dim sum than you can eat.

The service is speedy and you get your food quick but you may not get anything else. They run a skeleton crew and the only thing that seems to happen consistently is your order gets taken, food gets brought out, and they take your check. Drinks may not get out to you and after you send your check it may take a bit to get your stuff back. The prices are very reasonable. Around $7-$8 for a lunch special which includes your entr\u00e9e, rice, soup, an egg roll, and a crab puff. Nothing special but it tastes good and comes out piping hot.

I chose to go to the bar, order a glass of wine, and peruse the menu.\n\nThe drinks are expensive but I didn't think the food was.

They also included the plastic-ware, napkin, and soy sauce, which a lot of places forget.\n\nLooking around I found a whole lot of goodness along with a couple disappointments.  Most notably the newspaper strewn about and behind the bar, to the right were a lot of boxes stacked in an unsightly fashion.

We were excited to find the Golden Buddha and have made many trips over the years all the way from the Troon North area to get our fix.  However, service has declined to the point where it is no longer worth the aggravation.  We went there last night for Chinese New Year and will never go back.  Granted they were very busy because of a lot of large tables there, but waiting almost an hour to get our food is not acceptable under any circumstance!  45 mins. into our wait, the waitress came back (after we flagged her down to ask about our food) and said one of the dishes we ordered was not available....after 45 mins.!!!! What makes the whole experience an unforgivable one is that the manager/owner is so indifferent and never apologized or offered a discount off the bill...nothing.  When we left, the same manager was at the piano singing in Chinese. Huh?  Other than Nee House in Scottsdale, the search goes on for a restaurant that serves authentic Chinese food closer to home.", "type": "review", "business_id": "jbKVbSz51F8IcewsiRQu4A"}

As a result, the dish was dry and salty.\n\nThe sticky rice was good (hard to mess up), the chicken feet were okay (needed more five spice powder), and the shumai was alright. The noodles were good, and I can see why the cart ran out after the first round. The diners were an equal mix of Asians and Americans. I would've preferred to see more Asians eating (as I am used to in a Chinatown and gives an indication of authenticity), but I do realize we're in Phoenix where the Asian population is not like San Francisco or Houston. \n\nThe meal came to about $30 for two, including jasmine tea. The carts are loud because they are made out of metal and roll on tile. I am also not used to staff members shouting what they have in their cart, like a newspaper boy yelling \"Extra!

This was not a good first attempt....\n\nWe went to dim sum on a Thursday lunch around 1:45pm. \n\nThere was only one cart. The woman said there was usually one more cart with the fried stuff, but they weren't running it at this time. So normally there would be 2. I thought, not a good start but it's ok I mainly like the steamed dim sum anyway. We got everything they had in the cart excluding short ribs and beef balls, which I typically don't order anyways. Here's what we had:\n\nSiumai - no shrimp, spongy and bloated,  weird tasting. When you cut into it, it was colorless--just this pale brown blob. It tasted like...nothing? It was the weirdest thing. I had to ask for chili sauce just to have a flavor.  I swear you can judge a place's dim sum by their siumai--it's the staple dish! So of course everything else followed suit.\n\nBean Curd Wrap -- Isn't this supposed to be filled with seafood and vegetables? Easily unwrappable in a light broth? Nope. More colorless pork. The sauce it was in was CONGEALED. Like a weird gravy. \n\nMa Tsang -- This sticky rice wrap was probably the best part of the dim sum. It seemed over-steamed though. When I unwrapped it, the rice just slid out, and it was overly moist. Usually when you unwrap one, you gotta scrape it off the leaf. The flavors were there at least. I had a bone in mine though. But other than that I could at least manage to enjoy it.\n\nChicken feet -- Overboiled skin and not very flavorful sauce. worst part is one of them still had the NAILS on. I definitely did not want to see that.\n\nChar Shiu Bao -- The bun had a good texture. The char siu filling seemed candied and overly sweet and the pork was dry.  \n\nMeh.", "type": "review", "business_id": "jbKVbSz51F8IcewsiRQu4A"}

It took a while to settle in, and several \"uhm, no thanks\", but we got the groove, and stayed for longer than we should have.\n\nAll in all, i could not recommend the place, unless you are in the neighborhood, hungry for some easy kill, over the age of 40, and like sliders.

You see, I'm just too mature for all that now... not to mention wise. Yes, I officially became wise that morning. It was pretty rad.\n\nSo, anyway, I went out with my mom in Scottsdale, AZ to celebrate the big 3-0. She took me to the \"hippest\" place she knows of... a.k.a. the only place she knows of Eli's, or as I like to refer to it, 'Cougar Central'. It was a cute place in all, I mean it's frickin' huge compared to any place in LA. I could've played a round of golf in there, but it started to depress me a little. I was like, thanks Mom, is this what I have to look forward to? Will I one day have leathery skin and bad makeup to go along with my blond hair and fake boobs the size of watermelons, because I'm trying as hard as I can to detract from my withered face and still be sexy? What are you trying to tell me here woman? I know you birthed me and it was a painful experience and your vagina is probably still mad at me, but this is just cruel and unusual punishment.\n\nBut then, amidst the Frozen Strawberry Daiquiri fields a light appeared from heavens and the hottest Cougars I have ever seen in my entire life took seats at our table. Granted, they did have watermelon sized fake boobs, but despite that one faux pas (it is Scottsdale after all), they were 'classy' from head to toe; stylish, but not in a, \"I bought this outfit at ForeverSlutty1 this morning\" sort of way; well put together- no tacky bleached porn star hair- no bad make-up choices, just some hot to trot confident 50 year old women- and these women had some dance moves too! Thank goodness Eli's provides some live music... You'll be in heaven if all your favorite songs are from the 1994 top billboard chart... I kid, but not really. Anyhow, these Cougars sorta put me to shame on the dance floor.\n\nSo, on with it, I watched as  gross middleaged out of shape men, one after another, pursued these hotties with passion in their eyes, and these bitches be like, \"NEXT.\" It was rad! So, the moral is: there isn't a fucking moral, but this was my experience at Eli's and Cougars are A-OK.", "type": "review", "business_id": "n6Zz_KdxcUou8b2MSoz2tw"}

I search for places nearby and see Elis is close by so in I go.\nFirst thing I see are three tvs on the side of the bar, each with a different game on and one of them the Angels game. Yes!!!\nI sit down and ask the 60-something barkeep what's on tap. Answer: nothing. Seriously????? Wtf????? It's a BAR how do you not have beer on tap. Oh man.....\nThey at least had Guinness in a bottle so  thinking \"OK, the game is on, food on the menu looks interesting, I'll hang around for another beer and some dinner then see how it goes\".\n20 minutes later and I'm STILL waiting for the bartender to ask me about another beer. Well, was it busy you may ask. No dear reader, it was not. In fact, there were two old guys nearby who are locals and were helped straight away when they needed something. So I'm sitting there watching the old guy, a young guy and the two young girls who were working (hostess and waitress) chatting, talking, doing everything EXCEPT asking me if I want another beer. POOR!!!!!! Very poor....\n\nSo, why two stars? I was pretty much ready to walk right then and there, but another bartender came on and immediately asked me if I need another, after introducing himself and shaking my hand. Real nice guy, the kind of bartender you want in the place you go to regularly. So, I stay. Even got some food, a half order of tenderloin sliders which were not bad, along with a half order of sweet potato fries. The fries were decent and are thick steak style fries, not skinny shoestrings. The food actually got them a star right there.\nThe vibe of the place is interesting. I started reading the reviews of the place while I was waiting for the second beer and getting ignored. Saw a couple mentioning spotty, irregular service. Let's see: 20 minutes of being ignored, check. Younger bald guy walking around and looking at the Yankees game on one of the TVs when     He's not chatting up the waitress, check. Yeah, I'd say spotty fits. \nNext, clientele. I'm there for happy hour, and I'm the youngest person in the bar who is a customer. Of which there were 10. And I'm going into my mid 40s so there some old folks rocking it. But dammit, none of the cougars the place seems to be known for on other nights then the one I'm there. Hosed again....\n\nSo I finish my meal, the cool bartender takes my bill and drops a free shot on the bar for me, a vodka chocolate thing he calls dessert for me. Nice touch, and not bad. Another star for the total of two.\nTo sum up my long tale of woe: clearly a Monday night at this place during baseball season is not really happening. The food is decent but seriously, unless you're a local and have been coming here for a while, I can't see why you would walk in the door.", "type": "review", "business_id": "n6Zz_KdxcUou8b2MSoz2tw"}

It is a strange mix of people, mostly an older crowd of regulars. Last year we went there 5 minutes before start of Super Bowl.

Guess they thought all those people who reserved those seats and did not pay a fee to reserve were all gonna show up. Now, a year later we show up 10 minutes before World Series. Maybe 10 people in the whole place, with the exception of a group of parents getting ready to walk over to the Chapparal High School game.

Then a waitress looks at us and hurridly  keeps on walking. Note, not one person is being served a damn thing while we just look around wondering WTF. Then a buxom blonde waitress walks by and asks if we have been waited on. We tell her actually no, we got our own menus and seated ourselves. She doesn't say, \" I will have someone be right with you, NO, she says \"we are busy\" and proceeds to take off into knowhere land. We look at each other in stunned belief.  I am not going to beg someone to take my money in this economy.

If you are a twenty or thirty-something looking for something a little different on a weekend night, I would give Eli's a try!\n\nRecap:\n              a) Happy hour ends at 7pm\n              b) multiple large TV's that are great for games\n              c) around 8:30 the cougars and sugar daddies come out\n              d) bring a younger guy friend for free shots from the decked out cougs!\n\nP.S.

A friend who lived in the area took me here Monday night for happy hour, and I have to admit I was a little skeptical. He raved about the food, but I wasn't too sure what his standards were.\n\nUpon walking in, we scoped out the place and decided to sit at the bar, but there were plenty of tables elsewhere and seating outside, as well. The owner, Greg, greeted us as we Sat down and got us drinks right away. He also offered to change the channel on one if the TVs if we wanted.\n\nWe took advantage of happy hour prices ($5 well drinks) and ordered a few beverages. Then, we perused the huge menu....they have a lot of choices sure to please all- even a \"skinny\" menu! The chicken teriyaki sliders and BBQ chicken cheese quesadilla (you must try- it really works!) were the winners. Greg continued to talk to us, making us feel welcome. He's really into making the customers happy and putting out the best food (not \"bar food\"). Both goals were achieved on this visit!\n\nThe chicken teriyaki sliders were tasty- small grilled chicken breasts topped with cheddar cheese and served on mini slider buns, with a cup of teriyaki sauce to dip. We opted for the whole order (6 sliders) since we were sharing, but a half order is available, too. \n\nThe BBQ chicken cheese quesadilla was my favorite. The BBQ sauce sneaking out of the quesadilla was smoking hot and yummy, as was the cheesy goodness inside. This is definitely large enough for 2 to split as a meal, or several people to share as an appetizer. I would order this again in a heartbeat!\n\nIf you're in the mood for great food in a bar atmosphere, this is the place for you. Don't come in looking for college kids or a younger crowd (at least not on a Monday night). There is plenty to keep you occupied here, too- whether it be the several TVs, pool tables, or a live band, which was just starting to play as we left around 8:30. And, don't forget to say hi to Greg!", "type": "review", "business_id": "n6Zz_KdxcUou8b2MSoz2tw"}

And the interior screams more 'bar and pool hall' than 'grille'. But, open minds are required when you try a new place. The menu selection is huge...sliders, burgers, sandwiches, fish, steaks, chicken, salads, soups, tacos, pasta, etc. This is usually a red flag for me - so many options often mean the kitchen doesn't do anything really well - which reinforced my low expectations. \n\nWe ordered drinks right away, and wanted to enjoy them while we were perusing the menu and deciding where to start. Our waitress kept coming over to see if we wanted to order. While I appreciate her not ignoring us, we did tell her we wanted to enjoy our drinks and then order. After about her 3rd or 4th check in, we decided we'd better order something. We started out with the brat sliders and to our surprise, they were quite good! Hmmm...my food expectations just went up a tad. \n\nFor entrees, we ordered the Acapulco fish tacos and Very Berry Salad with grilled chicken. The tacos were loaded with fish, and very, very good. The amount of chicken that came on the salad was huge! Although the arugula was limp and not as crisp as it should be, and I would have like more berries on a \"very berry\" salad, they were at least fresh and flavorful. I should note at this point that we ordered a couple more drinks with our entrees, and after entrees/beverages delivered, our waitress was pretty much MIA. Considering how hovering she had been, we thought she'd check in more often. The place wasn't overly busy so not quite sure we were slighted. Someone else came by to clear off the table. We then waited...and waited...and waited for the check. We finally got the attention of our waitress and had to ask for the bill.\n\nWe sat in a side booth which allowed some great people watching. And an interesting clientele it is. Other reviewers mentioned the old foogy / cougar crowd. Didn't really see any of that action, but the crowd was definetly more mature. That's not always a down side. Looked like there were some regulars that knew each other. We couldn't see the band, but unfortunately, we could hear them. They were very mediocre and despite their encouragement, few patrons took to the dance floor.\n\nAll in all, the food: surprisingly good. The service: not so great. Atmosphere: just not my style so I probably won't return. In fact, if I had checked out their website prior to going, I probably wouldn't have gone at all. (Really??? Pictures of their bartenders in tails and briefs???)", "type": "review", "business_id": "n6Zz_KdxcUou8b2MSoz2tw"}

People had secured tables early to listen to band, so stragglers have to work the fringes of the roomy bar to attempt any pickups. Dance floor way too crowded to get close. Televisions here are big and all over, so excellent sports viewing is available. As for food, I opted to try the famous sliders. Went for the Teriayki Chicken verson which was pretty boring as the small chicken breasts were covered with cheddar and then the dipping sauce was teriayki sauce. Barely ate 4 of the six for $9.99. They should include a few fries at that price with the sliders, but no luck there.

I'll assumed I could take my receipt and his, and just pay for both. I mean, there's no way they were going to lump 25 people on the same bill, right? I mean.. we had like 10 couples and a bunch of kids. I got the food, which was okay, said happy birthday, and wanted to head out after being there for an hour or two. \n\nI got my waitress, who seemed a bit over her head, and calmly asked for my bill so I could leave. She gave me a menu and said \"Figure it out for yourself\". \n\nWhat. The. Hell. \n\nFigure it out for myself? What was the point of a register? Do I look like an accountant? What are City of Scottsdale taxes here, anyway? Are we on a barter system? Why do I even have to pay anything at this point, if it is some free-for-all where I tell you how much my food was and you maybe/maybe not charge me?! Seriously.\n\nI stood there, trying to talked to here, for 10 minutes and she just ignored me. Like in a bad movie, I was standing there, making eye contact, while another person who was supposed to be my server pretended I didn't even exist. Unbelievable. I was so furious, I almost lost it.

Side dishes were pretty good as the sweet potato fries narrowly outdid my garlic mashed potatoes. Also, my bun fell apart near the end, some kind of fancy bakery roll.\n    Otherwise on a Thursday night, the place literally emptied out the second happy hour ended. All the greybeards headed home and we had the joint to ourselves which was perfect.

Tenderloin appeared to be half the size of the old portions and came back dry and gray despite the fact that we requested medium-rare. I suspect that the meat was dry from age and not overcooking as it was barely marked from the hot grill. \n\nA few years ago at lunch there would be at least two servers and a bartender.

It was a good deal at $10.99 for happy Hour (3-7). You get a half-rack and some top-notch homemade coleslaw. Normally, the half rack is $15.99. Yes, the ribs do fall off the bone and if you put some of their excellent BBQ sauce (it comes unsauced and basically unseasoned) it turns into a three-star ribs. These were a bit fatty though and I'm not sure they were truly baby backs, but overall they were good, just nothing that would be worth ordering again.

We should have heeded that warning, but instead, went in and ordered dinner. Now we know why most of the reviews here are about Karaoke, bands and drinking and NOT the food.\n\nThe first problem we had is the place is so dark inside, you can barely see. The first booth they sat us at stunk so badly of vinegar my eyes were watering and my stomach started to turn. The waitress then moved us to another booth, but it still had that vinegar smell that was making me ill, but not as strong.\n\nWe decided to split the fish and chips combo (with fried jumbo shrimp) and waffle fries. \n\nThe waitress brought us fried jumbo shrimp, charged us $1 extra for a 'plating fee' (for splitting the food among two plates). I asked where the fish was and she looked dumb-founded. Then she left to correct the error, never offering to refill my drink.\n\nEnsuring a dining customer always has something to wash down their food is waiting tables 101. If the wait staff doesn't have the time or the desire to keep refilling drinks, they should either offer larger drinking glasses (for soda and other free refill drinks) or the server should have brought two so she wouldn't have to worry about it. It costs her nothing whether I touch the second one or not, and it saves her time should I need a refill after that. Or, let the customer get their own fountain drinks, as many other establishments do. The irony is I drank that soda while waiting for the food to arrive. While the food was served hot, my drink was dry and the waitress just vanished on us, leaving us no choice but to sit there and watch for her (in a very dark building) to get her attention while our food grew cold.\n\nThe jumbo shrimp was very good. The waffle fries tasted like frozen Orieda fries you can buy at any grocery store. They didn't taste bad, but they didn't taste fresh. Done eating our shrimp and fries, the fish finally showed up. Two pieces actually. The amount of fish was less than expected, considering we were served 6 of the jumbo fried shrimp. But after we tasted the fish, we agreed any more would have been a waste. The fish was flavorless. Not only was it bland, it had a very fishy taste to it. \n\nAdding insult to injury was the price. That ONE meal with two drinks (both non-alcoholic) came out to $30+.\n\nBottom line, if you're looking for a bar to buy over-priced drinks, listen to drunk people sing off-key and watch sports on numerous TVs that you cannot hear, this is, apparently, the place to be. They typically call these types of places a KARAOKE BAR. On the other hand,  If you're looking for a nice, sit down RESTAURANT, go to Guido's on the other side of the street. It's well lit on the inside, far cheaper and Guido's broasted fish and chicken are to die for! Lesson learned.", "type": "review", "business_id": "n6Zz_KdxcUou8b2MSoz2tw"}

I am sure that the wine selection is just off the hook.  However, I am a beer guy, and Khoury's also scores on craft beer.  I went on a Thursday when they have wine tasting from 6-8pm.  But guess what, they also sometimes have beer tastings on these days too. \n\nKhoury's carries three drafts on tap for peoples' enjoyment.  Today I tried the Dogfish head Raison D'Etre.  What an amazing, well balanced, slightly fruit tasting ale this was.  Not only that, but the beer guys shared an IPA from Alpine Beer Company that was amazingly smooth, but still high hops and piny.  This beer isn't normally available outside of California!\n\nBoth the beer and wine selections are great.  You can find a number of great craft beers here that you can't find at Lees and Total, and the fact that the owner of Khoury's realizes that community events like tastings are a way to not only attract new customers but also broaden peoples' horizons, is completely impressive.

They have a weekly wine tasting on Thursdays from 6-8pm and a twitter photo was enough to finally get me out there.\n\nTerri K and I met up for a quick wine tasting session. The guy from South Africa was extremely friendly and took us on a nice journey through his wine lineup (a wineup perhaps?). He was so nice, I was compelled to purchase a bottle of Sauvignon Blanc. I also decided to pick up a 6-pack of Nectar IPA that looked intriguing. Like I said, the people there are always so helpful and friendly. They are never short on beer advice. They even have a couple of tables where you can pop open and enjoy your purchase right there. According to their web site, you can bring your own food. Not sure why I would ever do that, but it's good to know.\n\nYes, it's a far drive for me, but now that I know exactly where the store is located, I will definitely try to stop by more often when I'm in the area.

I may make the occasional visit to Aces or Total or Lee's or Whole Foods, but Khoury's is the hippest beer place in town.  This is the only place where you can sit down at a bar and enjoy a craft beer, either one from the tap or one from the fridge, and NOT have to listen to slot machines or blaring music.  That's right folks, this is a unique place.  This is a place with an intimate setting and fine beverages, and sometimes you don't even feel like you are in Vegas. I know, I know, it is blasphemous to the Vegas \"scene\" to be without slot machines or loud music, but it is the best scene in Vegas.  \n\nI've been coming to Khoury's for the past few months on most Wednesday nights when they have beer tastings.  I've purchased sour beers from Khoury's from breweries such as 3 Fonteinen and Contillon.  I've had Dogfish Head 120, Deschutes Black Butte XIII, barrel aged Black Hole from Mikkeller, funky Joly Pumpkin Farmhouse Ales, Maui IPA's.  The list goes on.  I've tasted many beers that just aren't available in Vegas, from Russian River sours to Great Divide barley wines.  This place, my Yelping friends, is the mecha for beer, the best beer in town.\n\nKhoury's also features great wines.  There is a wine tasting every Thursday night.  On both Wednesdays and Thursdays food trucks accompany the tastings.  The best thing about this place is the knowledge that the owner has for his product.  Issa, a native to Nevada, has such a vast experience with wine, beer, and liquors, and offers expert advice and opinions on the products he carries.  Issa is the little guy in town that fights for distribution among the big boys for the finest beverages that come to this city, and he usually wins because he knows his stuff.\n\nFolks, if you take beer or wine seriously, Khoury's is worth the drive no matter what part of the valley you live in.  I drive weekly all the way from the west side of town to partake in this rare oddity of subculture and escape from the generic Vegas scene.

They even have an area with various beers on draft, as well as a few wines. \n\nI think the thing that really sets Khoury's apart from other places like Lee's is their excellent knowlege and customer service (a huge deal for me), their fantastic atmosphere, their super friendly staff, and very unique approach to selling spirits.\n\nI'd give them ten stars if I could!", "type": "review", "business_id": "TWv8GCM-sZ3BtU5LRoc3Ag"}

My personal experience was that I was looking for a super limited beer(only like 2 cases came to Vegas), Deschutes Dissident to be exact, and although they flew off like pancakes, the staff was still kind enough to reserve one for me. I was even able to pick up some items that I didn't even know hit Vegas yet. The staff actually cares, can offer REAL recommendations, and are full of knowledge. Real customer service makes up for their smaller selection and I live 30-40 minutes away, but its always a treat to come by.\n\nThey have quite a bit of wine taps and beer taps, which means you can actually drink in their store. There are also weekly events from wine tasting, spirits, or beer gatherings paired with a local food truck that you can find out from their calendar (http://www.khourysfinewine.com/Calendar_of__Events.html). I believe there is no corkage fee as long as you buy something from the store. \n\nSupport your small local businesses, especially ones that go out of their way to build a community.", "type": "review", "business_id": "TWv8GCM-sZ3BtU5LRoc3Ag"}

They have brewers from some of the best breweries come down each week along with a food truck.  Or you can go on Friday when they infuse one of their amazingly tasty kegs with a crazy flavor.  More into wine?  Then go on Thursday, when they have weekly free wine tastings.  Looking for that special bottle that Southern Wine and Spirits doesnt provide to Lee's or Total?  They will get it for you at a great price.  The owner and staff are superb, and the ambiance is great.

In reality the staff knows nothing about service and may as well be herding cattle. The place is always packed based on unjustified hype that is sure to fade as fast as a $100 bill on a roulette table if they don't start delighting their customers.\r\n\r\nThe full story: \r\nWe were in Vegas for a bachelor party two weeks back and needed a place for the main event of the weekend. After doing some digging around, the consensus seemed to be that Tryst is the newest and hottest of what Vegas has to offer. We've all heard the story of the 12 guys that walk up to the bouncer in a trendy club but never actually walk past the bouncer so we called ahead to make a table  reservation. Now I don't really know how this is calculated but the manager tells us that getting 12 guys to Tryst requires a 4 bottle minimum. Sure, what the heck it's a bachelor party! We make the reservation. \r\n\r\nFollowing a great Friday night at the Voodoo Lounge we get to Tryst on Saturday expecting another one, but far from it. After telling the host three times that we have a table reservation we wait around for about half hour while we watch wads of $100 bills being exchanged and scores of guys going in. Great, more guys! Then the manager calls to say if we want to guarantee being seated at a good table we should \"take care of the host\". Finally the host comes to get us, we thank him and pass a $100 bill, he looks at his hand, I look at his face, apparently multiple bills were in order. Somehow the best man manages to sweet talk the guy walking us down there and we get a nice central table. Once we sit down we're informed that we need to order all 4 bottles right away, so 2 vodkas, a gin, and a rum come our way for about $500 each plus cost of mixers (yes, they charge extra). A few hours pass, we drink, we laugh, we have a good time and we're down to the one bottle of rum. The bouncer pays a visit to inform us that one of our friends looks a little too drunk and needs to go home. We promise to take care of him, he's cut off. Next comes the waitress to deliver the news that if we want to keep our table we need to order more bottles. \"But we still have a bottle!\", nothing, \"But the bouncer says people are too drunk!\", nada, \" But we just spent a few thousand dollars!!\", no use. We're shipped to a table far in the back corner outside, right next to the emergency exit. At least if the 8 foot bouncer decides to throw another one of us out, he won't have to drag us too far. \r\n\r\nOh yeah, the waterfall's nice. I hope their freakin reputation drowns in it.\"", "type": "review", "business_id": "DJlb6DLzT1yK5ipnL2I1dA"}

It's free!\n\nThe house tour is my preference and certain days of the year it is free, though I am not sure exactly which ones.  If you are from out of town, this reminds me of a smaller version of the Isabelle Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston but on a slightly smaller scale, house-wise.  However, the grounds here probably trump the Gardner Museum.  The Model T house is currently under renovations, but you can still check out the bowling alley and gardens!  Even cooler, they use foods and herbs grown in the garden at the newly-renovated Frick Cafe, I hear.\n\nThere is also a very small free parking lot.  It is best to get here early if you want to utilize that, but there is some street parking as well.  Not on a major bus line.\n\nThe Frick is a super cool place, and for a mid-sized city, this is a true gem!", "type": "review", "business_id": "XWLtYPhCpHht5Zn52zp3-Q"}

Nobody greeted us, despite seeing several employees at the entrance. But we still enjoyed every bit of the evening. There were a few food trucks at the entrance, but we packed our own dinner instead. It's nice to have the option though. And another option is the on-site restaurant. \n\nI'm looking forward to returning with a larger group for another Friday and hopefully for one of the First Friday's when there is live music.", "type": "review", "business_id": "XWLtYPhCpHht5Zn52zp3-Q"}

Admission is required for the tour, but it is free to visit the gardens and the Frick museum. Clayton epitomizes the opulence of the Gilded Age-make sure to check out the Playhouse on the way to Clayton as it is the size of a small house! Start your experience in the Grable Visitor Center. Here you can purchase admission to tour Clayton and browse their museum shop which has many interesting books about the history of Pittsburgh. \n\nClayton was home to the Frick family from 1883-1905 and is quite well preserved. No photographs are allowed-just an FYI. Touring is only available for the first and second floors, however, you get to see the bedrooms, the kitchen, the library, and the calling room, in addition to the servants quarters. While Frick was an extensive art collector, most of his work is displayed in New York. The family home contains many paintings of the family though. The Frick Art Museum has some of his collection and typically has a rotating exhibit as well. The car and carriage museum is an interesting step back in time as well with items ranging from old Lincolns and Rolls Royces to a winter sleigh. Photos are allowed in this area. There is also a cafe, which I hear is quite nice, however, it is also quite hard to get into and reservations are a must. I highly recommend visiting for the holidays as they attempt to redecorate the home as the Fricks did at the turn of the century. The tree is beautifully decorated this time of year and worth viewing. Also of note, there is a parking lot so be sure to take advantage of the free parking.", "type": "review", "business_id": "XWLtYPhCpHht5Zn52zp3-Q"}

Sigh. Don't get me wrong, the cut was a good cut. The salon itself was clean and stylish. The owner, welcoming and friendly. \n\nNow what went wrong. The cut was good, but it certainly wasn't what I expected from a salon with the reputation of Izzazu. I wasn't bowled over by my stylist's professionalism either. Don't diss my previous stylist....she rocked....you don't do yourself any favors by knocking someone else.  (And come on, I was WAAAYYYY overdue for a cut since I've been driving to Cleveland for a style.)  That being said, for $55 (and saving big bucks on gas, tolls, lunch and shopping) the cut was still a deal. But, when I started to sign the charge slip, it said $65, not $55. \"But,\" I said, \"the website said it was $55 for a Master stylist.\" \"Oh,\" the chick at the counter said, \"that's for Men's cuts.\" Silly me. \n\nSo when I got back to the office, I went online and checked. Nope, it said $55 for a Master Stylist WOMEN's haircut. Hmmmmm. So I called. The chick at the counter now said, \"Oh, our stylist's charge whatever they feel the cut SHOULD be.\" What?????? So I quoted the prices to her from the Izzazu website. She changed her tune again. \"Oh, well.....I'll refund you $10 if you give me your credit card number.\" Didn't she have my slip with the card number? \"Sorry, I don't give my credit card number over the phone.\" \"Or I can send you a gift certificate.\" \"Nope,\" I said through clenched teeth, \"I won't be coming back.\"\n\nIt wasn't the cut. It was the bait and switch. I'd gladly have paid it had they been up front and above-board ahead of time. As Judge Judy says, \"Don't pee on my leg and tell me it's raining.\" \n\nThe search goes on. Or I'll be back in Cleveland in the spring for the next cut!\n\nP. S.  One amusing side note:  I checked in at Izzazu when I arrived.  Turns out, I'm the Duchess!

The address Yelp has listed is their old address. They are now located at 301 5th Ave and have been since October of 2010. My apprehension was due to the downtown location. Not so much parking per se, but loathing a pretentious salon atmosphere. Pittsburgh salons never seem to lack pretension and not surprisingly if you have read my other reviews pretension is something I could not abhor more. Nevertheless, the reception staff and my stylist were very courteous and service oriented. Thankfully, hoity-toity is not a word I could use to describe either of them.\n\nAs I have never been to an Izzazu salon before, nor have I asked my friends if they have either, I did not know which stylist to request. When I made my appointment I asked the woman, \"who would YOU want to color and cut YOUR hair?\" I was told Frank is an excellent stylist and had availability for the time I requested. \n\nFrank was knowledgeable, personable, and kind. He was meticulous and diligent about the low-light placements as well as making sure I have the proper amount of them. Too often, especially when using Groupons stylists hurry through placement and provide them sparsely. But this stylist did not forget the point of businesses choosing to provide Groupons. Provide excellent service, and those new customers will return! \n\nI've read one or two other reviews that commented on dirty bowls and a lack of sanitation. Perhaps I am not retentive enough to write a thorough review. I am not here to nit-pick businesses. Not to say that I did notice my color bowl, it resembled a normal color bowl not dirty or offensive by any means. Perhaps in the past they possessed such bowls and learned the errors of their ways. Or perhaps some people can never be pleased. All I can say, I was not worried about any sanitation concerns.\n\nI highly recommend visiting this salon and requesting Frank.

Unfortunately the two stylists didn't get a tip through no fault of their own. I can't give an unbiased opinion of their work as I am still furious in the way I was treated.  I would expect some ambiance at $100 for shampoo & style. I could never recommend Izzazu. Denham & Company is on Market Square, their rates are reasonable and within walking distance of the Fairmont. I am calling the concierge tomorrow informing her of my experience.", "type": "review", "business_id": "cuuJJ9W3tYmidaLvlzvPBw"}

The calorie counting adult in me knew the right decision would be to split it.  I mean, let's get real... this thing is monster size!  You can easily split it BUT... I could EASILY gobble that whole thing down in one sitting!  \n\nIt was amazing!  We watched them heat up the cookies and toss them into the soft serve vanilla ice cream that melted it just enough that it mixed in perfectly with the warm chocolate chip cookie.  Add hot fudge and it was ice cream overload to the max.  But in the best way possible.  \n\nMe thinks I'll be stopping here a lot this summer... it cannot be avoided!", "type": "review", "business_id": "2PfavOTufsPCRdYm-bFcpw"}

Turns out Page Dairy Mart has been in the same location for about a hundred years. It was a gas station for a long time, it was a service station, they had a farm stand in there for a number of years and it was twice slammed by flood waters from the nearby Monongahela river.  But its still there, serving delicious ice cream treats, burgers and handmade lemonade.  I am tempted to go there every week in the summer.  I went today and I think I may go back next week too.

Their ice cream is creamy and full of flavor and their artic swirls are filled with all the good stuff, no more digging at the bottom to find the goods! They use Nancy B's decadent cookies, which shows you they care about the quality of what goes in their ice cream! There is usually a line to wait in, no matter what the weather is, because everyone wants a piece of Page's! The only small, teeny tiny issue I have is the location, while there is much history behind it (Refer to windows for newspaper articles), it is dangerous to pull in and out of on the corner of Carson and Becks Run. I got in a horrible accident by someone who hit me coming out of Fagel Street, which is right behind the dairy mart, so just be careful pulling in and out of Page's. Other than that, this place is sure to melt your taste buds! And it is wallet friendly too! Just bring the cash, no cards accepted (atm on location) and make sure you get there before they close for winter!!", "type": "review", "business_id": "2PfavOTufsPCRdYm-bFcpw"}

The food is still great, the patio is nice, the hood' location is still scary and fun and the smaller menu items and additional staff are appreciated.  I do wish he had more options than just italian wine, but last night we were able to find a great white.  The salmon carpaccio last night is the best I've ever had.  The mussels with diablo sauce was also excellent.  I  don't know of any other small restaurant chef in Pittsburgh that takes as much care in the quality of ingredients used (except for Douglas Dick at Bona Terra).  In my original post I said it was a bit pricey, but I've decided it's well worth the cost now.  I also tried a ceviche here that was out of this world.

There I chatted with the chef as he prepared my app. Explaining as he went on, first slicing fresh chantrel, portobellos, and button mushrooms. Next he saut\u00e9 them in olive oil, added brown sugar, brandy, raisins, and finished it with heavy cream. They were fantastic. There were a variety of specials including wild boar chops, a risotto with prawns, scallops, and black truffles. But I chose the dry aged filet with lump crab in a leek cream. It was the best piece of filet I've ever had. It was easily a pound of beef and a half pound of crab in a light cream sauce with leeks. I could barely touch it after the pasta, salad, bread, and appetizers. I brought my leftovers home and have them another time. Dessert consisted of a nice portion of carrot cake with an apricot cream cheese icing with apricot jam filling. It was a nice take on an old favorite.

Before sitting down make sure you get in the proper state of mind and prepare yourself for a long night of indulgence. This being my first dining experience at Alla Famiglia, I was unaware of the challenge that I had undertaken. We had A Party of Five, empty bellies and an optimistic mentality; we couldn't resist the tempting appetizers recited to us and ended up ordering the mega meatball, calamari and shrimp, and sausage over polenta. All were amazing. The meatball was the highlight: twelve ounces of perfectly cooked beef, filled with mozzarella and covered in sauce and provolone (kisses fingers). Big plus for including the tentacles in the calamari. I've noticed these legs less and less while dining out, when did they lose suction as a staple of a calamari appetizer? Also adorning our table were a few clothing options in which to dress the bread, all of them enjoyable on their own or as an ensemble.\n\nOne would think after such a hearty opener all that remained was the main course. How wrong of an assumption that turned out to be. Before we could even think about crushing our dinners, we had to face two formidable courses of salad and pasta. As mentioned by other reviewers, the salad is great. Nice dressing, nice fillers, nice roughage. The pasta that's included with the entree was a fusilli bucati in a vodka sauce served family style. Unable to pass up the promise of a great carbonara with guanciale and fresh egg, we had two pasta opponents to tackle. Both were cooked so perfectly al dente I would have put them on my NHL all-star ballot as a write-in if voting hadn't already closed.\n\nAt this point in the meal, I had completely forgotten that I still hadn't even seen my main course. And I was fine with that. As a table we compiled quite the culinary collection: bistecca fiorentina, veal milanese, veal marsala, mussels in a diavola sauce and the sea bass special for the evening. You know when a meal is so utterly divine that you just stop talking to everyone around you and have a one on one pow wow with the gastro-gods? Yeah, that's what happened. I will say at one point during the meal, my brother had to get up and take a walk around the restaurant for fear he would wake up two days later in the ICU if he didn't fight off the impending food coma that threatened his existence. Instead of napkins they should have given us a white towel and a trainer to throw it on the table for us because we were doing our best impression of Apollo Creed...and our food was Ivan Drago.\n\nOur waiter, who we thought was our friend, then had the nerve to ask if we wanted dessert, some balls on that guy. Of course we wanted dessert. We decided on the tiramisu which I hope had a clean bill of health because it blew our minds. It was so good that I was upset with myself. I did exactly what I hate seeing someone do on any and every food network show. I took a bite, put down my fork, closed my eyes and just said, \"wow!\" I just hope it was as good for the tiramisu.\n\nOther housekeeping items: you can bring your own wine for which they charge a corking fee. All the water is bottled, but I didn't see it on the bill so I figure it's included. The chef/owner is extremely friendly and accessible, as he is cooking basically right next to your table. Parking at the meters next to the building is free after 6pm, despite what it says on the signs; our waiter informed us they have an unspoken agreement with the parking authority.\n\nHeavy on the belly, heavy on the wallet, heavy in our hearts!", "type": "review", "business_id": "qUeBDN0D8SC93KeAHhiL-g"}

To start they set the table with \"Holy Oil,\" which is banana pepper olive oil for dipping Italian bread in, a seasoned cecci bean and cheese gustoso and a goat cheese and olive spread. I wish they sold that banana pepper olive oil because I wanted to have it every day of my life! \n\nWe ordered the famous Meatball appetizer. This meatball is for serious! It's massive and stuffed with mozzarella cheese. Yep, I'm for realz. It was just oozing Italian sexiness, in a ball. As soon as I tasted the red sauce, it tasted like my Grandma's, which sparked fond memories and made me want to actually live in this place. \n\nWe also ordered the Trifolata, which is assorted mushrooms and currants in marsala cream. It was also incredible. The bad/good of it was that it wasn't really needed because they give you so much food, but it was delicious, so whatever!\n\nFor the Third course they serve you your choice of pasta either with their famous home made vodka sauce or fettucini.

Loved the broth, loved the succulent scallop (just one, but I can't complain, I was stuffed by that point!), the shrimp was jumbo and the fish was perfectly cooked. And the garlic bread was excellent.\n\nWhenever anyone says things are expensive, I usually think they're talking $30 a plate. But, this place is legit expensive. Think $50 (ish) a plate.

I usually get a seafood dish, whatever it may be at the time, and it is always one of the greatest things I have and will ever eat. I want my final meal to be from Alla Famiglia. Please. I don't care if it costs a car payment or two or three.", "type": "review", "business_id": "qUeBDN0D8SC93KeAHhiL-g"}

I also knew that it wasn't really in my budget. Well, lucky for me an old college friend of mine decided that he was coming to town for a visit. I sent him the websites for various restaurants and when he saw Alla Famiglia he said, \"Oh honey. Make the reservation - I've got it.\"  YES! I knew I kept him around for some reason!\n\nSo on a cold, snowy Saturday night, we trudged up the mountain. And it was glorious.\n\nFirst off, it IS in a bit of a sketchy neighborhood. But no worries - they have valet, so you don't have to deal with trying to find somewhere to park and walking around.\n\nThe Holy Oil is the best thing I've ever dipped bread into - and I'm a dipper. I come from an Italian family - we dip everything into everything - bread into sauce, cookies into coffee, bread into coffee, etc. This is by far the best dipping experience I've ever had.\n\nOnto the MEATBALL. We got the mozzarella-stuffed meatball for our appetizer. The meatball was good. The sauce was great. There isn't much more I can say about it, to be honest. It was just so, so yummy.\n\nSalad course: Great salad!\n\nPasta course: So, I was slightly disappointed that they did not give us a choice. I was really looking forward to the fettuccine in the cheese wheel that I had read about here! Alas, only vodka sauce. Great vodka sauce, though. I should've asked about that damn cheese wheel...\n\nFor the main course, I got the veal chop milanese and it was perfect. My friend got the cioppino and he enjoyed that very much.\n\nI could not even think about eating dessert. We had so much food. I took 1/2 of my pasta course and 3/4 of my main course home. I really wish I had gotten a dessert to go and eaten it later, though. \n\nI really cannot wait to go again.", "type": "review", "business_id": "qUeBDN0D8SC93KeAHhiL-g"}

Everything feels authentic, straight from Italy, and family owned. \n\nWhere to begin? Well the appetizer selection is incredible, my favorite being the provolone fried in truffle oil. The stuffed banana peppers were to die for, and I have had many others that were spectacular.\n\nFor the entree, I have had both the veal chop and the filet. The veal chop is almost as large as my arm (not joking) and was delicious, prepared either of their two signature ways. For the filet, I do not like gorgonzola so I asked them to prepare it a different way (which they are very willing to do and usually announce to the table at the beginning of the meal). It was done is a mushroom sauce that was a perfect compliment to the perfectly cooked filet.\n\nFinally, do not forget to save room for dessert (which will be fairly difficult considering the sheer volume of food that they give you). The tiramisu is amazing, and I would highly recommend trying their gelato. \n\nIn short, my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. I would highly recommend a visit, especially with a large group.

Braised endive, house sausage, and tender white beans seasoned to perfection, and a meatball the size of your fist.\n\nBefore our entrees were brought out, we were each brought a salad and pasta course.  The fresh made pasta was served with the best vodka sauce I have ever had -   amazing.\n\nOn to the entrees;  I got the Veal Chop Pizzaiolo and my wife got the Coteletta Del Monzu.  Spectacular.   Both the veal chop and the cutlet melted in our mouths.\n\nAll in all, after a couple apps, two entrees, a bottle of wine and a couple cocktails, we got out for about $260 after tip.  That said, I've eaten at some amazing restaurants in my time, and I can say with confidence that last night's dinner is easily one of the top 5 meals I've had in my lifetime.  I can't wait to find an excuse to go back.\n\nWell done, Alla Famiglia.\n\n\nUpdate:  Visits 2 and 3 to Alla Famiglia were just as spectacular as the first.  My wife and I have ordered something different each time we've visited, and normally I'd say something like 'we haven't been disappointed'.  However, that would be an egregious understatement.  Every visit to this wonderful restaurant has been nothing short of  astonishing.  The food is truly breathtaking, and the service is top notch.\n\nIn my humble opinion, this is without question the best restaurant in Pittsburgh.\n\n\nUpdate 2:  As you can see by the number of check-ins I have here, we find every excuse we can to continue to come here.

This is the framed \"art\" inside the women's restroom located on the 2nd floor. Odd. I nearly poked my eyes out with my mascara brush from staring. It's hypnotizing.\n\nNow that we got that out of the way, let's talk about  the restaurant!\n\nAfter months of whining, a group of 8 of us finally decided to nut up or shut up and finally made plans. (Thank you, Samantha B. for organizing!)\n\nGetting a reservation for 8 is not an easy task. The building is a three-story, traditional townhouse  that is very narrow leaving only so much space inside for the dining area, bar, and the kitchen. And, it is located in the middle of Allentown. Yes, Allentown. This fact could qualify as the baby elephant in the room but it seems to be the trend to operate fantastic restaurants in areas that would make your average xenophobe from suburbia go bat shit cray cray.  And, for the record, I'm not drinking Hatorade. I was equally \"scurred\"  during the drive up E. Warrington Avenue...and I live in the East End where hipsters and old school hippies are known to reside and give peace a chance. \n\nThe reality is what it is. It's a scary part of town but it did not matter a damn when we got out of the car. It was a Saturday night and we were greeted by an average Joe  valet who sincerely welcomed us to the restaurant  and told us to enjoy our dinner. The locals who walked by smiled and nodded as if they were giving us their approval. It's as if the restaurant was under a dome, protected by a force field that doesn't allow the stereotypical nonsense most would fear when entering Allentown at night. \n\nWe were greeted by our server who immediately took our drink orders. I didn't see a bar on the first floor so I almost hesitated to order my usual dirty martini and my sweetheart's Manhattan, thinking they were limited in their mixology. Orders were taken without pause and both drinks were most impressive. Our friends enjoyed vino rossos and biancos from their diverse wine list that is 100% Italia! \n\nTables are set with \"Holy Oil\" for dipping artisanal Italian breads, a seasoned cheese and cecci bean gustoso, and, my favorite, a fresh goat cheese olive spread.\n\nWe started with the artichoke appetizer special and shared the meatball appetizer with the rest of the table. Yes, shared. The meatball is bigger than Barry Bonds and Kanye West's egos combined. And, it was friggin' fantastic. The flavors, the marinara sauce, the mozzarella stuffed inside...If I could marry a meatball, this would be matrimonial bliss.\n\nMy sweetheart chose the highly recommended veal chop Milanese. This is yet another piece of meat listed on the menu not small in size. Because I am always the a-hole of the group, I asked if I could have Linguine and Clam sauce instead of the pasta prep on the menu. Again, no hesitation. Wow. But the groans from my our table makes me still an a-hole. I DON'T CARE! IT WAS MY CARB DAY DAMNIT! :-)\n\nOur entrees did not disappoint. TASTY!!!! The entrees minus the pasta came with salad and pasta side served family style. Lots of food to be shared.\n\nWe finished with the hand-spun espresso gelato. Others at the table went for other gelato flavors and the Tiramisu. We all had spoons to share. All were \"delish\".\n\nI was tempted to order the other highly recommended entree, the Cowboy Steak Diane. My friend Beth had the pleasure. The wild mushrooms on her dish looked just as big as the meatballs and she raved about the Worcestershire butter. She offered me a sample but I was too full and ready to birth my food baby.\n\nOh yeah. How could I forget! Franco Harris walked in. SHUT UP!!! Not entirely surprising after viewing the wall on the second floor covered with photos of VIPs posing with the chef/owner. \n\nIt's great to see a gem in Allentown that can shine a light on the other diamonds in the ruff in that area. But don't let  the neighborhood fool you. This restaurant is VERY high end in service, cuisine, price, and atmosphere.\n\nI really enjoyed my experience at Alla Familigia so maybe it wasn't such a coincidence they placed The Terminator's Mr. Universe pic in the restroom...because...

Alla Famiglia has been on my list of places to try for quite a long time and I was eagerly anticipating eating a dinner here.  We arrived shortly before our reservation time of 7:30 at about the same time as another couple from our party. We were almost immediately taken back to our table which was on the first floor in a back room.  I honestly didn't notice too much while we were walking back to our table but thought there was not much decoration in the room we were in.  Yes there was a fireplace but nothing else really sticks out besides the fact that the lights would dim a bit for about 5 seconds before eventually brightening back up every 10 minutes or so.\n\nSince none of our party had ever been to Alla Famiglia before our server took the time to go over the menu with us.  Whenever he got to the veal chop and explained it was their specialty, I immediately knew that was what I wanted.  So I ended up ordering that with the pizzaiolo option while my fiance went with the seafood diavolo.  My veal chop was described as a double cut natural chop braised with hot and sweet peppers, homemade Italian sausage, and plum tomatoes while my fiances seafood diavola had many different types of seafood in it including a lobster tail.  All entrees also come with a first course of salad and a second course of pasta with vodka sauce, both served family style.  While we were waiting for our first course to come out they served us some crusty Italian bread along with a couple of different dipping sauces of which I remember one that had a couple of different imported cheeses, one with goat cheese and then another which was olive oil based and called the holy oil(?) due to a trio of herbs of which one was basil.  That one was my favorite and when combined with some of the Parmesan cheese that they had on the table was awesome.  After a short while our salads came out, 2 family style bowls for the 6 of us along with a dish of Gorgonzola so that we could top our salads with it.  The salad ended up tasting decent, I only wish that I had more of it.  The six of us quickly finished it all and then were in for quite a bit of a wait before our pasta with vodka sauce arrived.  It was long enough for all of us to notice and wonder what was taking so long for pasta.  Whenever it arrived, once again 2 family style bowls for the 6 of us, I thought that it tasted pretty good.  It wasn't the best vodka sauce I have ever tasted but since I was still pretty hungry at this point I really enjoyed it especially after adding some of the chili oil that they brought to the table with it.  The chili oil gave the sauce that perfect bite for me.  Almost immediately after finishing our pasta our dinner entrees arrived.  My veal chop looked impressive and was big enough to make comments about how it could tip the car on the Flintstones.  Most of that was due to the size of the bone although there was a decent amount of meat on it.  The veal itself was cooked perfectly as it was moist and juicy and I  ended up enjoying it. The pizzaiolo sauce was just ok though as some of the sausage that I had seemed to be burnt while others were fine.  Whenever I had the non burnt pieces I liked it but the couple of burnt pieces really made the sauce inconsistent from bite to bite.  I was also lucky enough to try some of my wonderful fiances lobster tail and thought that it was very good.  It was cooked perfectly and was tender and tasty while not being overdone at all.  After all that we had eaten our whole table ended up passing on dessert and I left the restaurant full but not overly so.  I am still wondering about all of these reviews that tell you how much food they received which was also said by the valet on the way in.  It made me wonder do they normally serve a family style portion to two people instead of the three like they did at our table?  Should I feel cheated on this one?  Maybe I will find out on a future visit but then again maybe I will not.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I might come back here again in the future but I don't think that this would be my first choice.  Don't get me wrong, the food here was pretty good but whenever my food bill after tip is coming out to about $150, they had better either have impeccable service like the Capital Grille or Ruth Chris' or to die for food.  Sadly Alla Famiglia let me down on both accounts here as the food was good and the service average.", "type": "review", "business_id": "qUeBDN0D8SC93KeAHhiL-g"}

The neighborhood seemed a bit sketchy. Into the restaurant I happily galloped. What a cute little place. Open kitchen in the first room. We sat in the second room. Homey, old school Italian feel. The server explained the menu and took our drink order. Hubs and I split a bottle of wine. Nothing better than a good bottle of red wine with a hearty Italian meal. \n\nWe were ready to eat. I dug into the bread on the table and thoroughly enjoyed the holy oil dip. So much so that I didn't even bother with the other two spreads. The menu was very veal heavy. I guess that's their specialty but not what I was looking for. I chose the filet gorgonzola. Our first course was salad. Served family style this salad was savory and sweet with raisins and gorgonzola on the side. Then we waited, and waited and waited. They are definitely not in a rush here. The next course was pasta with vodka sauce. After reading the reviews, I was a little disappointed that we were not offered the alfredo cheese wheel as an option. The vodka sauce was lacking flavor for me. I added a little chili oil and it brightened up some. Again we waited and waited. Finally, our entrees arrived. My filet was cooked well and tender. However, I did not care for the peppers and creamy sauce it was topped with. Also, this was the only part of the meal that I had left overs to take home. For me, the portion sizes were about average. I did not have mounds of left overs as other reviews noted. We opted to skip dessert. Overall, it was a good meal but nothing blew me away. I had high hopes for AF and was slightly let down.

If your looking for a memorable spot with some of the most delicious actually Italian dishes then look no further than Alla Famiglia. This is a restaurant to celebrate an occasion at such as New Years, Valentines Day, Anniversaries,etc. \nmy girlfriend and I came here for New Year's Eve and we could not have enjoyed it more. To start we had the Alla Famiglia Meatball. I couldn't get over the rich tomato sauce that the meatball was surrounded in and the smoothness of the actual meat. Just delicious, must have.\nWhen you order an entree you also get their house salad served in a homemade Italian vinaigrette (light and complimenting to the diverse salad topped with great peppers!) and their Penne Alla Vodka. This pasta dish alone is enough to warrant a visit . I am a alla vodka lover and this is the best I've ever had. It's hard to describe but its not to rich or creamy it's absolutely just right. The pasta itself was so smooth and melted in your mouth with their sauce.\n\nFor entree my girlfriend had their Ahi Tuna Steak (special). Prepared perfectly and with a great lemon butter sauce. I had their speciality, their double cut Veal Chop. This is something straight out of The Flintstones in its portion but let me tell you it's with every penny. I had the Veal Chop Pizzoaloa style wivh was with hot & sweet peppers, a great tomato sauce covered in provolone cheese. This was such a moist Veal Chop that literally fell off the bone and with the marbling it just melted in your mouth. \nEverything was spectacular , it's a restaurant you have to visit if your in the area at least once given you are willing to spend for your meal. $$$$ but you absolutely get what you pay for.", "type": "review", "business_id": "qUeBDN0D8SC93KeAHhiL-g"}

We don't go out & splurge like this often, so we were really excited for a special dinner. The food was out of this world (bread & sides, salad, pasta alla vodka and veal chop Milanese), but the service was absolute garbage. I've seriously been treated better at a TGIFriday's. We waited, pretty much unattended to, at the bar until 8:20 for an 8:00 reservation. Once seated, I practically had to beg for a wine list. We called a cab at the end of our meal and decided to get drinks & wait back at the bar. The cab was taking forever, so we called a different company. As my boyfriend was talking with the cab company, a waitress walked by. We heard her walk into the kitchen and loudly announce to the rest of the staff, \"UGH, those people at the bar are JUST now ordering a cab.\" It was 10:30. On a Saturday night.\n\nI don't know if it was the fact that we were some of the youngest patrons in there (early/mid 20s), but we felt talked down to and disrespected the entire time. Maybe if we were in our 50s like everyone else, they would've treated us like adults.\n\nWhen I plunk down $160 for one of the most highly-recommended restaurants around, I expect to be treated like I'm spending $160 at your restaurant.

I have never eaten there before last night, but I have eaten at Davio's and that is what the atmosphere reminded me of.. we were there a total of 3 hours start to finish.. 3 hours until our main course was served. But, many courses are served as you wait... most of them were delicious. They bring you out fresh, delicious, warmed bread at the beginning with a garlic oil sauce dubbed \"holy oil\" and it truly is heavenly. They also have a bowl of cheese and garbanzo beans to eat atop of the bread. Delicious. There is also a cheesy spread available. All were wonderful. Then about 45 minutes later, they brought our appetizer. It was a soupy-looking mushroom appetizer with a sweet flavor. I do not recommend this app. It wasn't good. Then about 35 minutes after that, a salad was served. It came dressed and was one of the best I've had. 35-45 minutes after that, the HIGHLIGHT of the dinner came. Pasta in a bowl. It was the best part of the dinner. Finally another long time after that - our main course came. Mine looked only slightly better than it tasted. I got the seafood diavolo and it was a huge disappointment.\n I really liked our waiter - he was very busy but attentive - but I cursed him under my breath for recommending this main course. I was so close to ordering a pasta dish, which I'm certain I would have loved and devoured. But I was talked out of ordering pasta, because pasta comes with dinner. I wish our waiter would have asked me what I liked; sauces, etc before recommending this dish. $68 for something you give to your cat is a hard pill to swallow. I love seafood, but I enjoy it in butter sauces, lemony butter sauces, Alfredo sauces, wince sauces with garlic... not this red soupy dish.\n It was literally like eating cold tomatoes and water with Tabasco sauce poured in. It looked like \"seafood soup.\" All the delicious seafood was drowning in a dark red, spicy, soupy mess. I wanted to cry when I saw it.. then I tasted it and really wanted to cry. It was gross. This is the last dish I would have ever ordered had I known how it was presented. I looked around at my date who had a massive veal tenderloin in front of him and I was so jealous.. wishing I had went with my first instinct - the pasta - or even the Halibut.. anything that wasn't drowning in a spicy red soup. I just hope that staff read this and never recommend this dish to a first-timer.. especially someone who enjoys seafood they can actually TASTE that isn't drowning in some spicy tomato sauce. If this dish wasnt so awful, I would have given 5 stars. The only other bad dish was the mushroom appetizer, and it was also a soupy mess. but, i would eat the mushroom app 3 times a day for the rest of my life if it came down to that and the seafood diavolo.", "type": "review", "business_id": "qUeBDN0D8SC93KeAHhiL-g"}

We had reservations for 7:30 on a Tuesday, so we obviously figured we would be seated immediately.  The brother and his girlfriend arrived a couple minutes before the reservation and were told to go up to the bar while they set the table and wait for the rest of the party.  I arrived about a minute after and my husband a few minutes behind me as he needed to park due to the lack of valet during the week.  There was no one at the host stand when either of us came in.  So we went up to the bar, declined a drink... and waited, and waited.  The bartender soon became deeply involved in picking a wine for a couple at the bar, not his fault.  The brother eventually was able to flag down a waitress to ask if she could check on our table.  She looked very annoyed.  She eventually went over to the phone at the bar, called down, hung up the phone and said, dead pan, \"no, it's not ready yet.\"  Not a smile, not a sorry, not a \"can we get you a drink on the house?\" Meanwhile, there was an open table for 4 on that floor.  The bartender eventually told us \"that's for a reservation.\" \"Yes, we have a reservation... for 25 minutes ago.\"  \"They must have specifically requested that table.\"  They did, however, offer us the table right next to the door on the first floor though - the one with the 10 degree breeze coming in that night.  No thank you.  We were very insulted by the lack of table for our reservation, but more so by the lack of acceptable service.  We decided to leave and spend $20 on pizza instead of $100+ per person and enjoyed much better service.. which is never the way it should be.  Hopefully they solve this problem soon.  We'll give it one more go when the insult has worn off.\n\nMy husband won't hesitate to tell you what his favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh is: Alla Famiglia.  And to be honest, these days I agree with him!  \n\nWhile my husband enjoys many of the more \"up and coming\" restaurants with smaller portions and interesting flavor combinations, he often finds himself longing for the same quality food with better cuts of meat and bigger portions.  This is where we satisfy both of our appetites for big flavor and, well, big portions.  But to reduce Alla Famiglia to those two things alone would not do it justice.\n\nLet's start out instead with addressing the two biggest critiques of this place: its location and the price.  Yes, it is in Allentown, but they also have plenty of parking and valet if you prefer.  Honestly, we drive almost everywhere to get dinner, so this is not an issue for us.  The other thing I always hear about is how expensive it is.  Some of those complaints come from people who I know have no problem giving their money to the big steakhouse chains, while getting a lot less value.  No, it is not cheap.  You will likely pay upwards of $50 for your entry.  The veal chops are close to $70.  But, that's not all you get.  You get delicious, fresh baked bread, a spread, dipping oil and gustoso for same, a delicious salad, and homemade pasta served family style.  If you wanted to be especially frugal, you could approach this place like an Olive Garden senior special: feast on the freebies and take your entree to go.  But, even if you're full, it may be too difficult not to savor the meal as it comes out...\n\nI've been here twice and my husband has been here three times (lucky - he got to go for work and he said they ordered almost every appetizer, all of which were apparently delicious).  The first time I ordered the filet with gorgonzola.  It was one of the most delicious and largest filets I've ever had.  My husband ordered a veal chop with prosciutto which I don't think I recognized on the current menu, but he absolutely loved it.  The veal chop is one of the largest bone-in cuts of meat I've seen and the sear on it was absolutely perfect.  We also ordered the mussels, which were spicy and delicious, and the meatball appetizer, which I remember being tasty, but nothing too out of the ordinary.  I think there are other things on the menu to try first. \n\nThe second time we came I ordered the Milanese veal chop, breaded, slightly citrusy, and absolutely heavenly.    He had the cowboy ribeye which was also large and an absolutely beautiful cut of meat.  The husband has a thing about fatty cuts and avoiding anything that is the least bit chewy, and he barely had to leave a piece on his plate.  We also got the calamari appetizer, which was perfectly, lightly fried with a savory, garlic sauce that sets it apart from the sweet sauces often served with calamari.\n\nFinally, I should note that the service we have received here has always been exceptional.  Everyone is always professional and courteous.", "type": "review", "business_id": "qUeBDN0D8SC93KeAHhiL-g"}

We were treated extremely well from the second we walked in the door.  They even had a menu printed with a \"Happy birthday Jennifer\" message on the top!  What a nice touch.\n\nWe were seated in the area near the door with a view of the kitchen.  There is also a small room (three tables) on the same floor.  The upper floor has a dining area and bar, but they are often booked for private events.\n\nWhen you arrive, there are three accompaniments for your fresh baked bread.  The \"holy oil\" that is an olive oil and banana pepper mix.  It lives up to its name because it was divine.  There was also a goat cheese spread that had red peppers and olives.  I'm a huge goat cheese fan, so I could have eaten this by the spoonful.  There was also a bean and cheese mixture with three types of cheese chopped up.  It was incredible as well.  You may be tempted to fill up on these delictible delights, but don't, becase as good as these items are, it only gets better from there.\n\nWe were having a hard time deciding whether to get the meatball appetizer or the hand pulled mozzarella.  The waitress steered us towards their meatball since it is one of their signature items.  It was a wise decision.  The meatball is the size of a fist and it was perfect.  I don't usually like meatballs or red sauce and I found myself devouring every last bit of both on this plate.  The meatball is stuffed and topped with an excellent mozzarella and then drenched with an amazing red sauce with bits of garlic.  If you order this, make sure you are sharing because it is huge. \n\nThe salad course was very tasty.  It as a mix of field greens, an olive oil dressing, gorgonzola and other incredibly tasty things.  I could have eaten the entire plate of it myself but wanted to save room for the pasta and my entree.\n\nThe pasta course is a house made spiral pasta in a vodka sauce.  It was extremely tasty.  So much so that my husband said he would have been happy if that alone had been his main course.  It had such incredible fresh taste.  \n\nFor our main courses, I got the veal chop prepared in the milanese style.  It was HUGE, pretty much the size of the plate.  A nice surprise considering how small portions tend to be at other fancy restaurants in the area.  It was served with a lemon butter sauce and had large chunks of crab on top.  It was tender and you could cut it with a fork.  I savored every bite (and have leftovers to enjoy at home).  My husband had the filet and loved his choice as well.  A lot of flavors and extremely tender.  It was served with a leek cream and I would love to know how they make it because I have leeks at home that I need to use for something.\n\nI swore I didn't have room left for even a single bite more, but when I learned that pumpkin gelato was the dessert, I had to try it.  It was so smooth, sweet and reminded me of the amazing gelato I had when I was in Italy.  A house made limoncello completed my incredibly amazing meal.\n\nYes, it is expensive, but it is worth it!

Pasta arrived - it was good, but it should be at Ala Famiglia.  \n\nThe dinners arrived at 7:25.   Yes, it was a 5:00 reservation.  At least it gave our Brunello time to breath.   The portions were big.  Lots of veal dishes, rib eyes, and filets.   Non cooked too long, or too short.  \n\nSo why the mediocre review?  The long wait?  No.   We were in good company, and enjoyed being together.  The problem was the large number of fruit flies that were all over our table.  I first noticed them in one of the empty cocktail glasses.  They liked the remnants of the Manhattan - and the cherry left in the glass.   Three of them dead, two more flew away when I waived my hand.  \n\nThat caused me to look over at my wine glass holding the $140 per bottle Brunello......yep, one dead, and one alive.  What do you do?  I fished out the dead one, and covered my glass with a cocktail napkin.  This was pretty disgusting.  We mentioned it to the waitress, but she didn't respond or summon a manager.  Not looking for a free meal or anything, but as a business owner myself, I would think they would want to know about the problem, and get it rectified asap.  \n\nI like the food, but I won't likely be back.  Oh, and for the 9 people, the meal was just shy of a $1,000.", "type": "review", "business_id": "qUeBDN0D8SC93KeAHhiL-g"}

I finally ate here this past Saturday and it was awesome.  Now I can't wait to come back!\n\nFirst, I urge you to make a reservation because every single table was filled while we were there, and for good reason--the food is AWESOME.  The food is so good you aren't even going to feel guilty about the calories you have consumed--because you will eat A LOT OF THEM.\n\nThe second thing you need to know is to show up HUNGRY.  Don't eat all day.  If possible, do what I did and work out earlier in the day, because you will leave this restaurant WELL FED.  To quote one of the great artists of our time, Ice Cube, \"Life ain't a track meet, its a marathon!\"\n\nIt is a marathon.  They're going to bring you out delicious warm bread as soon as you sit down, and supply you with heavenly toppings for it, including the famous Holy Oil that is truly divine.  Temperance is a virtue.  Don't be like me and commit a sin against your entree by eating it when you are STUFFED, and can't fully enjoy it. because like a fool you couldn't restrain yourself with the bread bc carbs turn you into AN ANIMAL and you didn't pace yourself.\n\nYou'll get all the bread you can handle.  Our waiter John, who was super nice and attentive, suggested we order the meatball appetizer and he was right.  Its huge, its literally the size of a softball and comes out wrapped in cheese, in a heavenly marinara sauce, served with love.  It was extremely good.  \n\nThen you get the salad course, which comes in a home made vinagrette which is also delicious.  \n\nThen comes the pasta course,  We had fusilli pasta in vodka sauce which was very good but at this point I was basically full and tapping out.  I ended up eating not even 1/4 of my pasta, but then the waiter offered to bag it up for me, so I had lunch for the next day.\n\nYour entree comes out after the pasta course, and you're going to be already stuffed at this point.\n\n Now, I took my friend here for his birthday.  I think they key is to come here when you are not paying, bc my bank account was crying when I saw the entrees start at $40.  More on that in a moment.\n\nI ordered the filet and it was SPECTACULAR.  I mean, amazing.  So good I did not share, and after I ate it, I fondly reflected on the time my filet and I spent together.  Temporarily in my mouth, forever in my heart.  Or on my hips.  It was not diet food, it was covered in some sort of heavenly cream cheese sauce that is the stuff dreams are made of.  It was a $60 dinner and it tasted like one too.  \n\nMy friend ordered the blackened sea bass and it came out looking like a work of art.  Both our dishes were basically food porn.  He loved his dinner too and said that his fish came out topped with large chunks of crab and he loved it.\n\nWe were waayyy too full to even think about dessert.  I'm sure the desserts would have been divine but we just could not do it.  In fact I ended up taking half my filet home with me.\n\nThis place is technically expensive, but if you think about it, it's really not that bad.  Our bill came to $200 for the two of us, but for what you get, it's really a pretty damn good deal.  You get top notch service, the restaurant itself is beautiful, and the food is absolutely incredible.  This was probably the best meal I have had in Pittsburgh.  Oh--and you get enough food that you get a full meal the next day.\n\n I cannot believe that I had not been here before, and I will absolutely be back.", "type": "review", "business_id": "qUeBDN0D8SC93KeAHhiL-g"}

We have found that to find quality Italian worthy of spending $$ outside of our own home has been difficult to find in the Burg. Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of Italian restaurants out there, but none we would seek out for a special occasion, so to speak. We have always found the New York/New Jersey establishments more to our liking....until now.\n\nAlla Famiglia is nestled in a not so nice of a neighborhood in the Burg called Allentown. Although we were never worried, but I could see how some may feel it is out of place in it's location. There is valet parking, so need to worry about your car while dining. Now once you are inside, you will soon forget where you are.\n\nThe inside is very small and there are 3 floors where you may be seated for your meal. On this occassion, we were seated on the third floor. Way up, climbing 3 flights of stairs can work up an appetite. Once on the 3rd level however, you can enjoy some of the religious artwork and beautiful stainglass featured throughout the dining area. There were 5 tables of various sizes and the bonus was the private restroom located nearby, so you did not have to manage the steps again until you were finished with your meal. \n\nI would also like to mention that we were dining early and although the room was rather private at first, it became QUITE loud as the evening went on and other patrons were being seated. I also think the free flowing wine helped the noise levels as the night progressed. Needless to say, we had difficulty hearing one another towards the end of the meal.\n\nThere were 5 in our party and our server was very attentive throughout the night to make sure any requests or special customizations were welcomed and met. We started our meal with the complimentary bread, dipping oils, goat cheese spread and cheese medley brought to the table. We all agreed to share the famous 12 oz stuffed meatball which was enjoyed by everyone at the table. In fact, everyone was asking for more of the wonderful sauce to accompany thier bread.\n\nSeveral items are served family style and come with any of the entrees that are ordered. We were then delivered and very tasty salad tossed with a light vinegarette which included olives, nuts and cranberries. Gorgonzola was brought on the side if desired. Then the pasta with vodka sauce made it's arrival. Several mentioned that they would have just ordered this if they knew how delicious it was. And this was just the beginning....\n\nOn came the entrees, several veal dishes were ordered, as it is their signature item on the menu. Although there were also many specials offered that night, everyone seemed to gear towards the classics. I ordered the veal marsala, which was delish! It was certainly one of the best I have had. One member of our dining party ordered the special pork chop offered that was huge! Another entree ordered was the filet mignon topped with lump crab meat and gorgonzola cream sauce. It literally melted in your mouth! I decided this would definitely be ordered on my next visit. All the food was cooked perfectly to order and scrumptious!\n\nWe were all pretty full but decided to share the Burnt almond tiramisu stuffed with raspberry for dessert. It was divine! I swear I heard the angels in the nearby painting sing as we devoured it!\n\nAs others had mentioned, it is a bit pricey, but for special occassions it is a must do. I felt it was quite worth every penny of our bill which was $306 for the party of 5. (We did BYOB) We have dined at much more expensive establishments and left unimpressed, which was not the case at all here.\n\nThe only negative was the long walk down the steps through the many other diners after too much wine. It can be challenging! So, watch your step! But do make a visit, you won't be disappointed!", "type": "review", "business_id": "qUeBDN0D8SC93KeAHhiL-g"}

I lived in Pittsburgh for 5 years and still had not been here or heard of it despite my extreme obsession with Italian food.

I now live in Philly otherwise I would probably end up here every other week (which would hit hard on the wallet since its delicious but pricey).\n\nIt's a small place with a very romantic/intimate vibe and an authentic feel. The portions were generous and extremely tasted even better re-heated the next day (a rare thing). \n\nThe one thing I would advise is do not gorge on the bread! This will be very difficult to do as it is delicious, along with the oil it is served with but you will regret it because there will be a lot of food coming afterwards.

The salad is one of the best salads I remember eating and could easily be enough for an appetizer.  The pasta tossed in a vodka sauce was just ok.  The homemade pasta is not actually made in house (I asked), but it is 'fresh,' which I'm assuming meant bought from a store on the strip or a market district.\n\nWe had also ordered the calamari and the meatball appetizer because we were starving and that proved to be way too much food for a family of 5.  If you must get an appetizer, I highly recommend the meatball, you will not regret.\n\nThe veal chop is easily the best thing on the menu and where Alla Famiglia really shines.  From all the pasta plates and steaks and seafood dishes that were ordered at our table, the veal chop was by the unanimous favorite at our table.  Incredible flavors and tender cuts, but by the time you get to the main course, you're full with the bread, salad, and pasta that comes before you can't really enjoy it fully.  Most plates come with a side of their grilled veggies (which again were ok), but some dishes come with nothing so I would make sure to ask if you need a side.   So long story short, this is a marathon and don't expect to be done in an hour and a half.  Pace so you can really enjoy that veal chop at the end!\n\nWhen you first walk in it seems very small, but there are back rooms and stairs that go up one or two floors.  There's also a back patio one floor up from ground floor.  It's tight sitting spaces, but very cute and authentically Italian.  \n\nSo now that we established that the ambiance and food are pretty solid, the thing that earned this 3 stars is how we were hosted to our table.  We had a reservation at 7:30pm and were 30minutes early, which we recognize is nowhere near to our reservation time so we elected to grab drinks and sit on the patio.  When 7:30 comes around we inquire about our table only to be told that there was not a sitting space yet, which would be ok minus the fact that there were multiple tables open that we asked about.  7:45 we asked again and were told that they were setting up a table immediately.  8:10 comes around and we're still not seated so had to ask the hostess again, which apologized and sat us at the table we had asked about 40 minutes ago when our reservation time was.  It took 40 minutes to seat us at our table for our reservation time of 7:30 when there were tables open.\n\nIt was a frustrating experience because everyone was hungry and we weren't even offered bread sitting on their patio...  The frustration unfortunately set the mood for the dinner and although our food was great, we didn't really enjoy the time we had here. \n\nWe really wanted to love Alla Famiglia.  Perhaps we'll try one more time and hope our experience is better.", "type": "review", "business_id": "qUeBDN0D8SC93KeAHhiL-g"}

The reason is simple, in reading the reviews below, I have to assume we hit Alla Famigilia on a bad night, at least I hope so.  The main reason for the low rating was the service.  We were seated on the third floor which is their bar area, at a high top table and the bar tender was our server.  She had to mix drinks for every table on the third floor, tend to the patrons at the bar and come around to wait on our table.  That was not fair to her and definitely not fair to us.  Her service and attentiveness lacked for obvious reasons but even when she was \"free\" she walked by our table without a glance and was apparently hard of hearing.  Furthermore, when ever one person got her attention for another drink or something, she said okay and left, without giving anyone else a chance to order.  The rest of the staff tried to pick up the slack a little but they were jammed as well.  Sounds weird, but I never felt so rushed in a 3 hour dinner.  The food took awhile, which is fine and expected on a busy Saturday night, just keep the drinks flowing and stop by once in a awhile so we don't notice.\n\nI also did not like that we were seated at a high top table.  I love the high tops for drinks and a few apps but for a 3 hour meal, these were uncomfortable, especially if your legs didn't hit the chair cross bars correctly (either too short or too tall).\n\nThe food was good, very good in some instances and disappointing in one.  I loved the pasta with Vodka sauce and the salad, both part of the entree which is unusual for a high end restaurant.  The meatball appetizer and the calamari and shrimp appetizer were the best things I ate all evening.  The biggest disappointment was the veal chop.  I love a good bone in veal chop but was leaning towards a seafood dish. I ended up changing my mind right before I ordered as I saw the veal chop brought out to another table and it looked amazing.  The disappointment was it was over-cooked.  It came out medium well at best (closer to well) and for $68, and for the amount they were serving that night, they should know how to cook them to perfection.  Not a spot of pink to be found.  No one even asked us during our meal if everything was okay or any issues.  When most of the chop remained on my plate and everyone else's entree was 90% eaten, not even a \"was everything okay\".

I'm telling you now the next time we return I will simply eat this pasta until I'm so full I could die a fat and happy death. \nFor our entrees Chris had the veal chop (holy mother this thing had to weigh 5 pounds!

We have mortgage as well as basic free checking and savings with Dollar in Squirrel Hill.  Mortgage application process was brutal.  Starting with the advertised rate of 2.85% being suddenly not available when we decided to lock it in; got 3.01%.  Automatic deduction of mortgage payment was required to secure this rate and it came out of the required Dollar checking account on the first business day of the month.  Free checking is free ... until.  Beware of Funds Availability policy.  We deposit a check monthly at the end of the month.  In August, the end of the month was a weekend and Labor Day was on September 1.  So our check did not get deposited until 9/2.  Mortgage payment hit on 9/2. It was paid, but we were charged $36 insufficient funds due solely to Funds Availability Policy.  After doing this first, Dollar then merrily hits us with two more $36 charges on smaller checks that would have cleared had they been processed before the mortgage payment.  Had we NOT been required to submit to automatic deduction of mortgage, according to our monthly statement, we had at least 10 days grace to make the payment, so Dollar's requirements and policies trapped us into this situation.  Moreover, there was over $3000 in the associated savings account that was ignored.  I called to protest, and one of the $36 fees was waived.  Then I was offered the \"deal\" of overdraft protection from the savings account for an annual fee plus a $10 transaction fee should this situation ever arise again.  Needless to say, I declined this deal and transferred the savings to the checking account where it sits until I find another bank and then fire Dollar.", "type": "review", "business_id": "lItAsttBd6f6VFvVxZSIgg"}

When I walked in, everything was ready to go. Large portion of chicken was served in plastic and rice was in standard paper folder container. They were not stingy about duck sauce, soy sauce, and fortune cookies. #win #win\n\nJust like the reviews below, the General Tso's was just so-so. It definitely wasn't extra spicy but it did have a mild kick to it. To me, the sauce tasted a bit like wing sauce from a dive bar. I would get it again because it was good but it didn't have an oriental flavor to it. When ordering from a strip mall Chinese food place, I always expect each piece of General Tso's to be a quarter chicken and the rest fatty breading to which I dissect and just eat the meat.  My expectations were met but I wasn't disappointed because the chicken was good. \nThe meal had a decent amount of broccoli in it which was cooked perfectly for my taste, a little firmer. \n\nThe egg rolls were OK. Super crispy and not much filling...plenty of oil. They were free and so I can't really complain.  \n\nI will definitely eat here again. I'll probably try Sha Cha chicken because it's spicier or Kung Po. This place is good if you want cheap food that will hit a Chinese take-out craving. \n\nEveryone that worked there was really nice - Even the chef in the back said hello. That alone goes a long way in my opinion. \n\nSide note - It's the day after and I'm not sick so I give my seal of health approval.", "type": "review", "business_id": "LltDzuzRbAJbSrqD4JH-3A"}

She was helpful, and recommended a jacket that would be usable in different types of weather. However, a friend who was with me said he had a different type of jacket (which they also sold), and she commented that the \"hated\" that jacket and that the liner was \"nothing more than a glorified garbage bag.\" Ok...\n\nWe also talked to a guy at the register about a '96 KTM 300 MXC that my friend just bought, and asked a simple question about a clutch cable. The guy seemed totally disinterested and clueless, and I'm not really sure if he even knew what a clutch was. He ended the conversation by saying that my friend should just throw his bike away because it was so old. What!?\n\nEven after that, I still bought a jacket from them and ordered a helmet I liked that they had assured me would be in later that week. I then got a call from them a few days later saying that the helmet was no longer available, but that I could pick another style. I then just ordered the helmet online and went back the next day to get a refund.\n\nI wanted to like this place, but between the thinly-veiled insults and seemingly clueless repair staff, I don't think I'll ever return.

The first slice of the day with completely cold, unmelted cheese was always just as good as the last one which would have melted the cheese slightly and gotten the tiniest bit less crunchy. It doesn't matter because the ingredients themselves are just tasty. But tragedy struck and Cranberry failed hard again at supporting good pizza and the store closed. I did some research online and discovered that, yes, DiCarlo's did still exist, but only in faraway lands that I would likely never travel to for pizza or any other reason.\n\nBut one day, I noticed something exhilarating. Is that a DiCarlo's location IN PITTSBURGH?! HOW LONG HAS THIS BEEN HERE? I felt confused, excited, bashful, sleepy, doc, but most of all relieved. That is until I decided I would need to confirm their existence with a quick phone call. See above.\n\nThat very night, I traveled to the south hills (a rare treat...) to rekindle my love affair. I gotta say, friends, this was one of the best first bites I have ever had. Exactly as I remember it. Four slices of pepperoni pizza and an Orange Crush. This is living.

Plus, I liked how they have Happy Hour later than most other places, from 6-8 pm ($2 off all drafts). \n\nAlways looking to try something new and/or local, I ordered a pint of Helltown Mischievous Brown ale, brewed in Mount Pleasant, PA. Not bad. If you're hungry, you can either grab some complimentary popcorn or peanuts to snack on. \n\nThe bartender was very good, as was the variety of music.

They have a majority of their beers that are 6+ bucks a pint which a bit much. You can get some for $4.50 - $5  but it cuts your selection significantly. It definitely makes you think twice before going here often.

I have never had a bad experience here and the owner and staff are fabulous.  The North Side has struggled for years to try to gentrify and it's been a slow process. If more places like The Park House would open in the neighborhood the effect could be exponential.\n\nI've been a patron for just about a year on the dot.  I can honestly say that I drove by more than a few times and didn't stop (even though friends recommended it) because I didn't know what I would find.  Boy, I wish I had that time back!  \nI'll start with FREE... popcorn, peanuts in the shell, great people, and music - yes, live music for FREE.  And, it's all good. Now, to elaborate...\n\nI live in Lawrenceville and crossing a river to go to a place in Pittsburgh is nearly unheard of. But, the people here are so awesome, I can't stay away.  Young, old, hippies, hipsters, locals, and happen-uponers all converging to create an amazing atmosphere.  Last night, there was a woman and her family from Seattle in addition to the familiar faces I usually see.  As other reviewers mentioned, it is like CHEERS - it only takes a couple of visits before folks on both sides of the bar know your name and you!  \n\nOf course the free snacks are awesome, they're free - and you can just toss your peanut shells wherever you'd like (my mom would be horrified to watch me throw them on the floor :)  BUT, THE MENU... WOAH.  Zamir makes his own hummus, falafel, tabuouli, and golani.  OMG it's ALL FABULOUS!  Last week I tried the golani platter for the first time -- a golani patty, hummus, feta, and tomatoes, served with pita.  The golani made me smile - spinach, carrots, spices, cheese -- it makes you want to eat your veggies!  I really had to decide last night between the golani platter and the Peace in the Middle East (tabouli, hummus, falafel, pita).  I was really craving the \"falafel master\" delicacy, so Peace it was.\n\nBeer. Um, there is a lot of it... imports, crafts, and domestics.  If you can't find something to drink here then you must not be thirsty.  I think there are 20 taps... I've never actually counted, but a chalkboard boasts their fine selection (stop in and count them, and let me know).  I'm a micro dork and have always been completely overwhelmed by my choices during any given beer season.  Also, there is a \"worst beer\" (it's never bad) discounted selection and some \"last chance\" items that are usually around $4/bottle or glass. \n\nNow, music can be a tricky thing. But like everything else here, it's never steered me away.  Every Wednesday is a bluegrass jam in the rear of the establishment.  Mostly it's members of the Shelf Life String Band, but they are often joined by folks who just want to sit in and play.  You may hear some bluegrass versions of Radiohead, The Coasters, Gorillaz in addition to \"trad-grass\" favorites.  Every Friday night there is live music by local and touring musicians and, like the popcorn and peanuts, IT'S ALWAYS FREE!\n\nBring your appetite and your friends down for a night of great company and amazing atmosphere... I'm fairly certain that you won't be disappointed!", "type": "review", "business_id": "YRDKsBFYP7G0E8BLJKIkvA"}

It's so Pittsburgh. (In a fun architecture way, not a dive bar way)  There was a good crowd for the music, but we were still able to get a table with a big group.  \nAs other Yelpers have pointed out, there's free popcorn and peanuts you can help yourself to.  They have a small menu, but the food is good.  We split an order of the hummus. YUM!  A couple friends ordered some sandwiches and they looked really yummy.  The beer selection is quite good, we all ordered some seasonals from various microbreweries.\nThey do have TVs, so you are able to catch a game and grab a bite if you are in the mood.  \nWe had a server who was efficient despite being slammed once the music started. I give her mad props, b/c I was not without a beer throughout the entire set.  That scores major points in my book.  I noted that people also seemed to be getting drinks at the bar timely as well.\n\nAll in all The Park House is a decent spot to hangout!

It's the one that that's stood out to us on our visits. Everything else is decent, but nothing special.\n\nMy one complaint is the cost of the whisky. I think Laphroaig 10 was $15 for a pour. That's way too pricey for a 10 year old Scotch that's only $50/bottle across the street at the Wine & Spirits. Otherwise, the beer selection is decent, as well as their limited, but decent bourbon selection. \n\nOverall, a great vibe, neighborhoody feel, and decent service will keep us stopping in whenever we're in the area and looking for a small snack and a few drinks.", "type": "review", "business_id": "YRDKsBFYP7G0E8BLJKIkvA"}

It is not in the best part of town firstly- there are people in front of it begging for money, some people ask you for \"squares\" which I found out are cigarettes- point being I know  cannot dock the restaurant for that- BUT management can take measures to keep the people from being right in front of their door. \n\nCame here on a Tuesday night after a kickball game with my team- I talked this place up because the last time I was here the food, drink, and atmosphere was awesome. This time... not so much. \n\nThe bar is understaffed, those who are seated wait like 7-10 minutes to get their drinks; as a bar that serves food- the bartender came to our table like one time every 15-20 minutes; because they have 2 people working here-where it needed to be at least 3-4. \n\nAnyway, it was trivia night when we came here. The trivia, complementary popcorn, and peanuts definitely were an up side that made waiting for drinks and food somewhat better. Their selection of drinks here is superb which is also a big plus. \n\nI ordered 2 orders of falafel without bread; after a long period of time (45 mins) I went to the bartender and asked her about my falafel orderS she only put in an order for one and gave it to somebody else... \n\nAll I can say was I was disappointed. But I have been here when there was a band, good service, and really fun atmosphere- I hope its better next time.", "type": "review", "business_id": "YRDKsBFYP7G0E8BLJKIkvA"}

It had been having some trouble with the battery, so I took it to the only place in Pittsburgh (apparently) that will help with this. A dark-haired guy greeted me as I walked in and treated me like a total noob, and his demeanor made me feel like the dirt under his shoes. However, he did give me good information and service about my camera when prompted by another man in the shop (who I might assume is Bernie). \n\nThey told me they could send it to the manufacturer where they'd clean it for a couple hundred bucks, but instead they cleaned out the sensors and the lens right there at the counter and checked the contacts between the lens and the camera. The dark-haired guy showed me through a magnifying glass what I was looking at, and explained that some spots I saw in the viewfinder were inside the top of the camera and wouldn't appear on the pictures. The other guy (Bernie?) explained to me some of the functions of the camera -- I knew these already, but it was nice to hear them explained and he showed me a few examples. They advised me to get a UV filter to protect my lens, which I knew was overpriced but I happily bought anyway to pay for their service. \n\nSo I think the kind of experience you get depends entirely on the person you run into. I can see how someone would be put off by the dark haired guy I ran into first, and how someone would absolutely love the service from the other guy. All in all I'm pleased with my encounter with this shop, but I probably won't buy anything from there considering how overpriced it was -- however, if something goes wrong or I need any service, I'll definitely go back.", "type": "review", "business_id": "bockWFDA3mzjuujY7tOcaw"}

Not only did they have exactly what I was looking for (and much more), but it was also competitively priced.

I happened to also be in the market for a few more items and was able to intelligently discuss the products.  Why?  Because Joe, like the other salespeople, is not just a salesman, but also a photographer. I noticed another customer who was new to photography was receiving quality advise from an exceedingly patient salesman, showing that they are not elitist but inviting about photography. They know their stuff and are very helpful.

I thought about how well German potato salad would taste with that beer.  So I grabbed a seat at the bar and eagerly awaited the first taste of my beer.\n\nAnd I waited...and waited...and waited some more - for over 15 minutes before someone came around to take the order.  Actually that isn't quite accurate.  Two employees came around - one to the end of the bar, and one behind the bar directly opposite me.  Both of them stared at me.  Neither one greeted me or asked me what I would have like to order.  I stared back, incredulously, and even made a \"what's going on here\" palms-extended-upward-shoulder-shrug gesture.  Neither one took the hint.\n\nFinally a third employee came around the bar and took my order.  Great, I thought to myself, finally that beer.  She served the beer in a Mason jar.  WTF?!?  Who serves imported German lager at a German restaurant in a freaking Mason jar?  Max's does.  The beer was devoid of its head, likely the result of a bad beer pour and/or a less than perfectly clean glass (an endemic problem with Pittsburgh restaurants, in my observation).  I was sad.  I quaffed my beer quickly in an attempt to salve my irritation and opened the menu.\n\nMy first impression of the menu can be summed as follows: \"Uh-oh\".  The menu is huge with a number of \"slow-food\" stews and braises.  The restaurant is more than half-empty.  How can a restaurant prepare such a large number of menu items, including more than a few labor-intensive dishes, freshly every day and still stay in business when the place isn't even half-full?  Answer: They can't.  The food isn't fresh.\n\nI ordered the Wiener Schnitzel.  I love properly prepared Wiener Schnitzel.  Made with fresh butterflied veal breast, slightly pounded and seasoned, well-coated in fresh bread crumbs, and pan-fried in clarified butter until golden brown on the outside and juicy on the inside, Wiener Schnitzel is the ultimate comfort food.  \n\nSadly, Max's Wiener Schnitzel had nothing to do with properly prepared Schnitzel.  The veal was super-thin, had a texture that strongly suggested it had been mechanically processed, and tasted as if it was pre-breaded and frozen.  It wasn't pan fried either.  The breaded, frozen, puck was simply dropped into a fryolater - where the breading puffed out and fell off of the meat in places (which doesn't happen when the cutlet is resting against the cooking surface under its own weight as when the dish is properly pan-fried).  The edges of the sad Schnitzel had curled up and it looked a horrible mess on the plate.  Curly Schnitzel?!?  My stomach dropped.\n\nMy sides, German potato salad and braised red cabbage, were equally awful.  The German potato salad had an unnatural glossy sheen - the kind that typically comes from bottled sauces that contain high fructose corn syrup.  The \"bacon\" in the dressing was nothing more than tiny flecks of some sort of processed, possibly faux, \"meat\".  The potatoes were suspiciously uniform in thickness and roundness - exactly the homogeneity that is found in pre-peeled, pre-sliced, vacuum-sealed processed potatoes.  It was a gluey, sickly sweet, mess.  I didn't have more than a bite or two.  The braised red cabbage didn't taste fresh - it tasted like it had been sitting in a steam table for a day or two and my order was its last chance to be eaten.  \n\nMax's Allegheny Tavern bills itself on their web site as, \"The Best in German Fare.  The Best in Service\".\n\nThat's total bullshit.  It's awful - both for service and fare.\n\nIf you want good, authentic, German fare (in which the Schnitzel is properly pan-fried to order and delicious), join the Teutonia Mannerchor down the street.  \n\nI'll never return.", "type": "review", "business_id": "IxQ1ATP_Wg_QujO9nywzcQ"}

(Both the families liked the food very much.)  Max's is the best German food in Pittsburgh -- actually, it's the best German food I've had outside of Germany, and I've definitely had worse meals in Germany as well.\n\nMax's is in a restored hotel, and the decor is very much in the Victorian style of the original hotel building.  The exception is the bar area that's good for happy hour or watching a game, or just having a beer -- that has a lot of neon and a jukebox.  But the bar area is also tasteful and pleasant to be in.  Max's has a full bar, but their real specialty is their excellent selection of German beers, both in bottles and on tap.\n\nI haven't met a wurst I didn't like, and they're pretty much all offered here.  The Braunschweiger sandwich is pretty delicious and unique in my experience, and the schnitzels are very delicious as well.  Another specialty is the kase spatzle (Spatzle noodles with smoked Gouda cheese -- a twist on mac and cheese that ensures that even a picky child will have something to enjoy here), but my two favorite menu picks here are the hassenpfeffer and the spinach salad with warm bacon dressing.  For sides, the red cabbage salad is my favorite, although the sauerkraut is also very good.  I don't care for the German potato salad, however -- I like the kind that has caraway seeds and vinegar, and is served cold, but Max's offers the kind that has an unidentifiable sauce and is served warm.  Some people like that style of potato salad though, and from what I can tell, Max's does a decent rendition of it.\n\nIf you're looking to reserve a room here for a banquet, you have a lot of options.  The basement \"Rathskellar\" is more bar-like in its atmosphere.  It would be a good place for some guys to have a birthday party or something.  For a rehearsal dinner or other formal event, one of the upstairs banquet rooms would be better.  Depending on the size of your group, you can arrange to have a buffet-style dinner, or individuals in the group can order directly off the regular dinner menu.", "type": "review", "business_id": "IxQ1ATP_Wg_QujO9nywzcQ"}

Its a great beef stew with spaetzle and you can get potato pancakes on the side.  The potato pancakes are, without a doubt, the best in Pittsburgh!!\n\nWhile the food is fantastic, the staff and customer service is what keeps this place from being really excellent.  Its a very \"come as you are\" sort of place and rightfully so as it's a tavern/restaurant but the staff may take the casual nature of the restaurant a little too seriously.\n\nOne evening about a year ago, I went in for dinner.  I originally thought to sit at a wooden booth in the bar and there was only 1 open, the last towards the back.  I sat down and the seat completely collapsed on me!  I'm far from what you'd call \"fat\" \"heavy set\" or even a \"big girl\" and the staff just sort of stared at me as though it were my fault that their booth just fell apart, the bartender even laughed at me while I tried to get up.  No one asked if I was ok, no one asked if I needed help and I was generally ignored as I tried to pull myself to my feet.\n\n*I* had to approach the hostess, tell her that the booth had just collapsed and ask to be reseated.  She rolled her eyes at me and told me the dining room was full so I'd have to wait.  \n\nOk, understandable... could you offer a drink or a manager or something while I waited considering the fact that your booth just broke apart?\n\nThe entire incident was either completely ignored by staff, like it never happened or I was looked at like it was my fault.  I didn't even get so much as an apology!\n\nI've been back a couple of times since then because the food is always good but I always sit in the dining room now which is sort of a shame because I actually like the bar atmosphere better.  \n\nLuckily for me though, their menu is online and they offer take out.  Unfortunately, they have the hostess answering those phone calls and since she's not a server, she doesn't have a lot of knowledge about the menu.  When I asked for a total, I was put on hold for a couple of minutes.  She finally came back and I asked how long and was put on hold again so she could go ask the kitchen.  She was quite rude about it, like I was bothering her.\n\nBottom line: Max's *is* the best place for German food in Pittsburgh, hands down.  But, the food is the only thing you're going for.

(At least when it's not Oktoberfest)\n\nWe'd been there once before and immediately fell in love with the place. I (still) keep raving about the Sausage and Cheese platter. They've got some good Gouda. The Potato Pockets (pierogies) were OK -- I'd take some Pierogies Plus or Forgotten Taste over Max's, but that's just me.\n\nThe spaetzel was to die for, however. It's like a German Mac n' Cheese. And boy, do I love me some Mac n' Cheese. It literally melts in your mouth with its' ooey-gooey-ness.\n\nDrink-wise, I tried their German lager and Thom tried the sampler. Thom is a beer enthusiast. For around eight bucks, you get a GOOD amount of beers to try -- they are not some dinky little shot glass samples, either. Thom had some trouble near the end finishing it...it was so much beer. Bob had a Captain and ginger-ale...in a king-size goblet. Goblets are the ONLY way to serve adult bevvies.\n\nFor dinner, I had the pork loin over an apple-raisin gravy/bread concoction. The pork loin was flavorful and tender, and quite delicious. Sara had the sauerbraten and seemed to enjoy it. Bob's burger was ginormous and looked extra tasty.\n\nWe finished it off with the Apple Fritters. Now, these fritters aren't for the faint of heart. And they aren't your average dinky small sized portions, either. You get two huge deep fried apple fritters, covered in vanilla ice cream. One person CANNOT eat the whole serving. You must, I repeat MUST share them. If you attempt to eat the whole plate yourself, you will have flavor explosion, followed by severe heartburn. But damn, are they GOOD.\n\nOur visit ended up totaling 2 hours. One thing, though...please fix your outdoor sign. Usually it shines out like a red and blue beacon in the night for people to find their way there, but on Wednesday, it was out. Driving there, I got confused on where it exactly was (but I had a general idea, as I had been there before.).", "type": "review", "business_id": "IxQ1ATP_Wg_QujO9nywzcQ"}

I've had several sandwiches, most of the appetizers and even the Sunday brunch (which has a good spread but can be hit or miss) -  though not all in one visit.\n\nI most recently took my Mom out for dinner using a Living Social deal I had.  Somehow, even though we have both been to Max's quite a few times before neither of us had ever seen the sampler platter option on their menu.  For just a bit more than the cost of the regular entrees, you can choose three entrees and two sides.  Obviously the portions of each selection are smaller than the individual meals, but the size is still generous and there were only a couple things not available for the sampler platter.  Between the two of us we selected six different items and four different sides to try and shared everything - and still had enough left for a full meal each the next day.  I can't even decide on my favorite of all the items we tried.  If you aren't sure about some of the entrees, this is a great way to see what you like.  I personally loved everything so much that I think my new go-to menu item from now on will be the sampler platter.  Not being forced to choose just one item is what living in America is all about.\n\nAll together I think our bill was around $35 (no alcoholic beverages consumed).  Some might consider this a tad pricey but the food is so good I usually don't mind the slightly higher cost.

They were cozy, but the seats reminded me of old fashioned church pews. Our waitress soon brought us a little basket of four rolls with butter, sauerkraut relish, and apple butter. Though I liked the different varieties of bread, it was nothing special. The relish and apple butter were a nice touch though.\n\nOur waitress was busy with both waiting tables and tending the bar, but she managed to check on us pretty frequently. Our food also came out relatively promptly. I order the Wiener Schnitzel with Potato Pancakes and Spatzle on the side. The Wiener Schnitzel was amazing -- by far the best I've ever had! The veal was tender and the fried surface was perfectly crispy. However, the sides sadly did not match this main dish. The Potato Pancakes were oddly bitter, and I did not enjoy them with either the sour cream or applesauce. I only ate two or three bites and completely stopped eating them. (I must add that Hofbrauhaus's potato pancakes are delicious and something that I order every time that I go there.) I also did not enjoy the Spatzle, but I am accustomed to eating cheese Spatzle.... So I may be reviewing this harshly since I'm just not used to plain Spatzle, but in my opinion, it was terribly bland and watery.\n\nOverall, Max's Allegheny Tavern served one incredible item (Wiener Schnitzel), but everything else was merely mediocre. Because of this, I really don't plan on returning to the restaurant again any time soon.

The gravy wasn't a rich and savory, it was canned or packaged with I don't even know what spices in it. When I complained to the waitress she said that most people don't like it either. She asked me if I wanted something else but I was in a hurry and ate the meat after I scraped the gravy off of it.

My partner has been in the basement before for various work-related functions, but I had never been there, despite driving by on numerous occasions. \n\n    We easily found on-street parking and entered the restaurant. I immediately loved the decor in the entry room/bar area, and those pleasant furnishings continued into the more intimate rear room where we were seated. We enjoyed the beautiful wall tapestries, and I thought the old newspaper-like menus were pretty cool! I was surprised (in a good way) at the old-fashioned urinals in the men's room. In a city that has struggled to nourish and revitalize its history over the years I was already a fan of how unique Max's was in the regard of feeling \"authentic\" in an era of predictable chains.\n\n     We were initially enticed by the prospect of ordering fried soft pretzels stuffed with cheese as a shared appetizer only to find out they were not available. We settled for the non-cheese-stuffed version, which were \"melt in your mouth\" good and were handsomely complemented by tangy honey mustard. We were a bit dehydrated after walking miles around the city, yet our waitress was very attentive in consistently replenishing our water glasses as soon as they were half-empty. I was craving a burger but was tempted instead by the fried fish sandwich, which I ordered with a side of potato pancakes and applesauce. My partner ordered a fried chicken sandwich with the same side I did. \n\n    Our food arrived surprisingly promptly. My fish sandwich was HUGE! I had enough to take home and enjoy for a post-work meal the following evening. The fish tasted fresh, although I wasn't a fan of having to pick small bones out of my mouth in exchange for enjoying that freshness. The bread it was served upon was tasty as well. The potato pancakes were thick, fresh, and were delicious when enjoyed with the chunky applesauce. My partner also thoroughly enjoyed his own sandwich. \n\n    As if this wasn't good enough our check was only $22! We will definitely be back soon, at which point I look forward to trying a burger!", "type": "review", "business_id": "IxQ1ATP_Wg_QujO9nywzcQ"}

Trust me, even if you don't really like German food, there'll at least be a sandwich you'll like here.\n\nThinking about my usual \"overall\" summary, I have to say this place wasn't bad and served as a reasonable place to meet - the beer menu looked nice from what I saw and the atmosphere was pretty cozy and even nostalgic and homely - but man, the dining options really weren't that extraordinary. I'm still torn as to how to feel about its menu, because on the one hand obviously it being Americanized meant even I could find something to enjoy, but on the other I feel bad for the people who do like German food and may not be getting what they hope for. \n\nIt wasn't bad enough that I'd say don't try it and see - just understand it may not be exactly what you expect.", "type": "review", "business_id": "IxQ1ATP_Wg_QujO9nywzcQ"}

You can order off the menu during brunch if you aren't in mood to gorge yourself on the buffet.  No drinks included with the buffet :( but you can order them, of course.\n\nI love the decor at Max's - it's an old house, and much of the furniture looks like it was in this house and just remained when it converted to a restaurant.

That might be because they closed the dining room door and started vacuuming the front bar room while we were still finishing up our dinner. I'm not sure if anyone was eating out there but I'm very happy we weren't because it seems really gross to me to vacuum around food. This was around 9:15 and I'm pretty sure they serve until 10. \n\nBesides that, our service was good and so was the food. We all split the stuffed pretzels and potato skins as an appetizer. The pretzels are delicious, I could have eaten them all myself! Deep-fried and stuffed with cheese, yummy! \n\nI ordered the Chicken Viennese and was pleased with my meal. It came with a choice of two sides and I went with a delicious sweet potato casserole and my favorite thing of the night: POTATO PANCAKES. I prefer sour cream, but you can also get applesauce.

Pick three amazing entrees, two awesome sides. Brilliant for $16.95... best deal on the menu. And if they have a meatball appetizer you want this. You do. \n\nSo which entrees: \n - Schnitzel. Whichever one you're drooling over. Personally Jager Schnitzel is always best because God blessed the world when he made mushrooms, and man praised God by making mushroom sauce.\n - Leberkase. Wow. This was fantastic. It's like a cross between liverwurst (but NOT made with liver) and a meatloaf. Fantastisch.\n - Weisswurst. It was good. I've had better and yes I know its a German faux pas to have weisswurst at any other time of day than a midmorning snack... however. it was still yummy and I happily moaned with each bite i consumed with mustard.\n\nSo which sides: \n - Spaetzle! Buttery goodness. Never had it or heard of it? Think little dumplings. In butter. Es ist wunderbar.\n - Sauerkraut... they make theirs with sausage. what?! Ja... mmmmm.\n - Potato Pancakes. You order these with applesauce. you hear me? applesauce.\n\nWhat to avoid... that's pretty harsh but they lost a star for a reason:\n - German Potato Salad was too sweet and soupy. My great grandma's recipe puts this to shame.\n - IF you don't like mustard (weirdo) the Sauerbraten has a mustard sauce. I like it, but others don't.

My thoughts:\n\nBrunch Buffet- I love the Sunday brunch buffet more than life.  Omelette station, German and American breakfast and lunch foods, and lots and lots of beautiful, delicious, and decadent desserts.  It's heaven on Earth.  There is usually a decent selection of meats, and the potato pancakes are almost always featured.  They've changed it a bit over the years, but I still love this buffet.\n\nAppetizers- My family loves the soft pretzels.  They are so yummy and buttery, but a bit heavy if you are going to eat your entire meal.  So make sure to share.\n\nMeals-  I, personally, have never had a bad meal here.  The sauasages of all varieties have been great.  The weinerschnitzel also great.  Sandwiches all good as well.  I really like the cheesy spaetzle dish that is just like macaroni and cheese but with spaetzle noodles!  I don't get too crazy and order anything complicated, though.\n\nSides-  I love love love their sides.  I could live on the spaetzle and potato pancakes.  Don't pass the sides up!\n\nDessert:  Also love their desserts.  There is a chocolate chocolate cake that they heat up with homemade whipped cream that is TO DIE FOR.  Not so shockingly, the apple strudel is wonderful as well.\n\nBesides the food, the servers are always very friendly and efficient.  There is also ample street parking, which is really nice.

They were great about the reservation we made for 12 and had a nice table in its own little room waiting for us when we arrived. I had the Hefeweizen style beer, which was good but had a strange taste and aftertaste to it, but it wasn't so bad as I ordered a second one. For apps we had the  Bavarian nachos (not great by any means and actually very odd...and cold), the stuffed fried pretzel and the red cabbage with sausages. The red cabbage here is amazing, and the pretzel was fairly good with a honey mustard dipping sauce...but I guess its kind of hard to mess up something thrown into a deep fryer and stuffed with cheese. For our entrees I had their \"famous\" potato pancake Reuben with sides of red cabbage (couldn't get enough!) and their house German potato salad - also very tasty. Fiance had potato pancakes, spatzel with cheese sauce and sausages. The spatzel was not in as a creamy a cheese sauce as I would have hoped - it was a bit oliy, not so much creamy. We were both a little underwhelmed sans the cabbage with the entire meal. I hate to say it - but I have had better authentic German style food at church potlucks and even Hofbrahaus (in a comparison to the beers at Hofbrahaus - these did just not stack up for me). I would give MAT another go round to try some of their other offerings - their schnitzels looked pretty good!", "type": "review", "business_id": "IxQ1ATP_Wg_QujO9nywzcQ"}

Their egg drop soup is pretty decent.\n\nI can't say I am impressed with their other dishes.  I've had curry chicken, shrimp fried rice, chicken soup, shrimp egg roll.  They were definitely edible just no where near as flavorful as the beef lo mien.  The chicken soup was horrible.  It was bland and the noodles were lo mien noodles.  Fried rice were ok but I've had much much better at other places.  They have a huge menu though so it'll take some time to go through them.\n\nThe obvious bad thing about this place is it is in a ghetto neighborhood.    It is probably not worth making a trip out there but if you're in the neighborhood, I'd say give it a try.  They're cheap and they give you tons of food.  It is cook to order so wait time might be a little long.  You can call in and order as well.

But after reading the few reviews here, I decided to go with the hot sausage.  When I first arrived, the meat was still cooking.  I didn't mind, I told the gentleman I would return and took a stroll over to Priory for some sweet treats for later.  When I returned, I was the only patron there but was greeted again and friendly small talk ensued.  I opted for a side of macaroni salad as well.  \n\nWhen I got home and unwrapped my sandwich, I was surprised by the hot sausage that looked like it was exploding at both ends.

We don't normally stay in nice hotels, so we were surprised by how nice it was, especially the extremely comfortable king-sized bed. It made for the perfect romantic getaway in a hectic weekend filled with bars, parties, and souvenir shopping on The Strip.\n\nThere are some things you should know before you book at The Priory, however. The hotel is right across the street from a housing project. There isn't enough parking, especially if The Grand Hall is hosting a wedding when you arrive. If you get a room that is street-adjacent you may be woken up by sounds like people talking or shoveling the sidewalk. \n\nOverall, none of these things bothered me that much (aside from getting woken up by the snow shoveler, but I suppose that was better than cracking my head on an icy sidewalk later!). However, if you're the type of person who gets easily annoyed at minor inconveniences or gets uncomfortable around lots of african-americans, you may want to stay at the Doubletree or Westin or something. \n\nIf you're looking for a charming boutique hotel and you're not afraid of being on the North Side, you should definitely check out The Priory.", "type": "review", "business_id": "hBAcj7X5JHeX2hvmptwH-w"}

I like to find non-chain hotels, but sometimes that can be scary...  The Priory was great!  Lots of character, not at all scary, very clean, modern, comfy - all the things you want in a hotel.  Well - the beds COULD be more comfortable.  It amazes me that hotel reviews rarely mention the bed.  To me, that is the most important part.  \n\nThe bed:  Too hard, for one thing.  The linens were great, very soft, and the comforter was perfect - light but warm.  However, the headboard was only loosely connected to the bed and - well, let's just say noisy.\n\nWe only stayed one night, so can't expand too much.  Breakfast didn't look too appetizing, so we went elsewhere.  The stairs are very squeaky but you can't hear them inside the rooms.  The elevator is great.  The bar was nice - small, but a great place to stop for a nightcap on your way back in for the evening.  \n\nI had made some specific request - away from the elevator, not facing the street, etc. - they fulfilled all of them.

Most of the churches are so beautiful that it's such a great use of space.  This is no exception, as it's just so unique inside! \n\nIf you're looking for that nontraditional hotel that's NOT a Marriott or Hilton, this is the place you'll want to stay!  It's fashioned like a European boutique hotel, plus all the amenities you'd be looking for like WiFi, a shuttle and continental breakfast (score!). \n\nIt's also a really lovely place to have an event.  For smaller events you can rent out specific parlor's for a reasonable cost and you're able to bring in your own caterers.  I really like this option because you're not boxed into one choice that may be out of price range.  If I would have gotten married in Pittsburgh, this would  definitely have been my first choice for the reception.  The Grand Hall is just gorgeous!  It has the original church organ and stain glass windows.  When it's all dressed up for the event it's just a stunning place for a magical affair! \n\nThe Northside of town, where it's located, has walkable access to the Andy Warhol Museum, The Mattress Factory Museum, The Children's Museum, The National Aviary, The Carnegie Science Center, PNC Park (home to the Pirates, go bucks!) and Heinz Field (home to the Stillerz, as we call them in the burgh).  Some are farther than others, but there's always the shuttle if it's in our frigid winter season.  In the summer, go for the walk so you can take in the sights!\n\nThere's also a lot of cute restaurants and bars on East Ohio River Boulevard, which is two streets up from the hotel.  My suggestions would be Bistro to Go and Bistro Soul, Rita's Italian Ice (personal fave) or The Priory Bakery for dessert!  There's also Legends North Shore not far on E. North Ave. about two streets up from E. Ohio and Amani Coffee Shop and Cafe for a quick stop for coffee or a great panini for lunch.   \n\nIt's really a fantastic time to go in the summer because EVERYTHING is within walking distance.  Plus they have a great farmers market in the park right along E. Ohio and they have kayaking in the park right by the Aviary.  The big kayaking organization, Venture Outdoors is right under the 6th St. Bridge next to PNC Park.  You're able to kayak around the three rivers for only $15 an hour!  It's a great way to see the city!\n\nThis is your place for one unique stay, I wouldn't steer you wrong!", "type": "review", "business_id": "hBAcj7X5JHeX2hvmptwH-w"}

The hotel is located across the street from a housing authority building.  Projects?  UGH.  Great.  \n\nThen we were put into a \"historical\" room that was similar to that of a rundown cheap apartment-- old shower stall, moldy threadbare carpeting, lumpy squeaky bed.  \n\nI find out an hour later (after freaking out about the lo-end aspect of this room) that they have new rooms that were just recently renovated.  I asked to see the room, and then ultimately change to that room-- for a fee, of course.  About 50% more expensive.  But I pay more because NO WAY would I be able to exist in this old \"historical\" creepy room.  \n\nFinally, a regular room-- the \"renovated\" room was similar to that of an acceptable hotel room.  Why even keep this historical, old, dingy, dirty room?  Do they figure unsuspecting people who don't know any better will just accept it b/c they have no other choice?? \n\nI slept well in the \"new\" renovated room, and would have been freaked out all night in the old room. What a difference. Actually, the bed and linens were very, very comfortable.  The bathroom was nice and clean.  The room was what I expected a hotel room to be... not high end four seasons, but not cheap and nasty either. \n\nThe hotel obviously had availabilities of the new, renovated rooms, so why put us in an old, unrenovated, ugly old apartment looking room? If they believed in upgrading, then they would have at least gotten repeat business!! For those who are going to book here, pay more for the new rooms, or go somewhere else.  The option of staying in the old room should not be an option at all.  \n\nI don't think I will ever go back here if I ever go back to Pittsburgh.  I will stay at a chain hotel-- marriot or whatever.  What is money except a means to be comfortable and live?  I will spend more next time.\n\nBreakfast was \"eh\".  It was free-- small stations of some fruit, cheese, small pastries, cereal, yougurt and two hot items:  sausage + bacon.  OJ, Cranberry, Milk and Coffee also available.

My husband made the reservation with a special they were having for a dinner date night.

When my husband called the Priory, they said they would make the reservations and call us back on the time.  We never got a call about the reservation time which was annoying.  But the main issue was we checked in, talked to the girl at the front desk about having the shuttle take us to this reservation at Meat and Potatoes, and she set us up with the shuttle.  We go in the room, look around for the $50 voucher, and it's not in the room so we assumed (i know we should never assume) that it was taken care of with Meat and Potatoes when they  made our reservation.  We had a fabulous dinner at M&P, great food, great service, and the bill comes.  We asked the server about this Priory $50 voucher and he had never heard about it so the manager comes over and says they didn't give them anything but to have them call and ask for him and he'll work it out.  We called the Priory and told them this, the girl who answered gave us an attitude and said you should have asked for it.  Then refused to call M&P to talk to the manager.

It was embarrassing and it wasn't the issue with the money, just the service with the priory.

The tiny and I mean very small bar, with three tiny tables and three bar stools is big on properly made drinks. \n\nI sat at a stool which isn't high enough for the bar which made for a rather uncomfortable seating. My friend Katrina has known the lone bartender, Nikki for years and has been wanting to get me out of my comfort zone and try new places. I beat Katrina to the Priory and found a lot of free parking out front (after 7 pm street parking is free) and went inside. \n\nNow situated, I sat down and looked over the menu and decided on a Monktini, citron absolute, fresh lime juice and razzmatazz. Perfect for a warm summer night, not heavy or filling, a little sweet, a little tart. Refreshing! After Katrina arrived another couple walked in and sat at one of the small cafe tables, the tiny room induces conversation with others, especially when the bartender introduces you to everyone. \n\nTime for a bite and this is where Monk's Bar lost a star (the uncomfortably high bar and low stools cost them a star as well) but as a practicing vegan, there were no options I could enjoy. Sandwiches are served on pretzel buns (monks invented pretzels) with options like a ham and turkey club, turkey, creamy chicken salad, and a few others I forgot. I did order hummus but it wasn't filling at all. I did enjoy the house made Lemoncello, although I have made this in the past, Monk's makes there's with grain alcohol which I found to be too strong. I'll continue to make mine with 100 proof vodka and forgo the impending hiccups. \n\nIt was a very interesting night, made new friends, found an interesting new spot and a really cool building I'd love to explore more of. Everyone should try Monk's bar and get out of your comfort zone.", "type": "review", "business_id": "hBAcj7X5JHeX2hvmptwH-w"}

How 'bout That.  Plus, the linens are cotton, the mattress was superior, the parking is free, the coffee, made in the right proportion was delicious and the continental breakfast served fresh fruit, local bagels, and real butter!

I decided on the Clark Bar.  \n\nI've only been to the Clark Bar once before for lunch about three years ago. I remember being impressed with the Boomer Burger and even tweeted the following about it: \"Just had a Boomer Burger at the Clark Bar for #lunch. Half pound of deliciousness discovered on the N. Shore of #pgh\" (the accompanying pic that I took that day is uploaded here). So I came back to drink a few beers and have some dinner with my lady before the show. \n\nSpeaking of beers, there's a limited selection of craft beers here.  As of this writing, on tap they've got Penn Marzen, Dogfish Head 60 min and Sam Adams Cold Snap.  In bottles there's Bells Two Hearted IPA and Sierra Nevada Pale Ale (they also listed Blue Moon and IC Light as craft beers but I'm sorry, I don't think so).\n\nI walked in the door at around 5:30 and I noticed that it wasn't too crowded; possibly due to the weather.  There were four guys at the bar and a couple of tables were occupied but nothing like I've experienced at the establishments on the other side of the parking lot.\n\nWhile waiting for my date to join me, I started with a Sam Adam's Cold Snap as a tribute to the day's February, single digit, temps before moving on to the Marzen. Both were decent beers, very drinkable, but nothing all that special.\n\nIt was pushing close to 7:00 when we decided to order dinner. By that time we were the only people left in the bar.  We asked the bartender about the crowd they get and if this is normal for a Friday night.  He said that lunchtime is normally their busiest time and he gets a few regulars that work in the building after 5:00 for a bite and a few drinks. Other than those times, it's before and after the ball games that draws the most business (as you would expect).\n\nThe menu is pretty simple offering a few appetizers, salads, burgers, sandwiches and the \"House Specialty\" Fish and Chips.  There were also specials listed on a chalk board at the entrance announcing drink specials, wings and a Cajun burger.  I decided I would go Cajun tonight. My girlfriend settled on a turkey burger. \n\nMy Cajun burger was spicy good delicious; perfectly grilled with a slice of pepper jack cheese and hot pepper rings balanced with a tomato slice and lettuce. I also got a sample slice of my lady's turkey burger (yeah, we do that) and it was juicy goodness as well topped with cheddar cheese, onion, lettuce and tomato. Her burger came with slaw and mine with fries.\n\nOverall this is a casual, easy bar.  They obviously recognize their Pittsburgh roots and being nestled between the two stadiums they cater to the Pittsburgh sports fan.  Photos of past local sports teams and legends adorn the walls in a relatively tasteful manner. But what's really cool is all of the autographed baseballs, bats and footballs in the hallway behind the bar.\n\nI'd recommend this place to any out-of-towner or anyone going to see a ball game or show on the North Shore. I give it a solid 4 stars for ambiance, service and delicious burgers. If the beer selection was better I would have up it to five stars.", "type": "review", "business_id": "k1A8pNspBPinGDivxkuDSA"}

The best time to go is right when they open at 6:30 am, it's the only way to assure that they haven't run out of your favorites. This happens often, especially with the whole wheat, which is downright incredible. They have everything from smaller hard rolls, sourdough and salt sticks, baguettes, larger loaves of pretty much every kind of bread you can think of. They even have featured breads daily, such as raisin walnut and cheddar focaccia. And the best part is, it's CHEAP!! Crazy cheap!

It has something to do with French occupation resulting in my older relatives knowing how to speak French and eating my curry with bread. (Grammar-wise, why are all my relatives eating my curry? I refuse to fix the previous sentence.)\n\nI went on a journey through Pittsburgh in search of a good baguette. Of course, being a student, my first destinations were Giant Eagle, Whole Foods, and Trader Joes. After I finished sobbing with swollen gums, curled up at the bottom of my bathtub, I was determined to not give up. Then I found the outdoor bread stand at Strip District, Allegro, and BreadWorks Bakery. All three make fantastic bread and specialize in their own things, but the award for best baguette goes to BreadWorks Bakery. For now... DUN DUN DUN.\n\nSo of course, with every bakery, there is the option of buying and eating right away. But there is also the option for half-baked baguettes at BreadWorks, where the bread is not fully finished and you finish the rest of the baking yourself. Now, if you hear yourself saying, \"Why would I do the rest of the job for them?\" I don't want to be your friend. Who would not want freshly baked bread at home? Ugh, who are you? Anyways, I buy a bag of those, put it in my freezer, then finish it off in the oven whenever I need my baguette fix. (Seriously, I love this bread. My girlfriend is worried about my waistline).\n\nSo what makes a good baguette? It has to be crunchy and thin on the outside, but delicate, light, and soft on the inside. You don't fight the bread when you eat it (and it shouldn't win, for that matter... your poor gums after sub-par bread); instead, it should break and tear easily. The bread here has those qualities.\n\nThe rest of the breads are good. There are tons of varieties. The mini rolls are adorable. And I LOVE BREAD.\n\nBesides the delicious bread, this stuff is also cheap, so huge bonus of awesomeness right there.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Z7HNl4Gz00cA0_wt0S-vSw"}

The staff member gave us all a menu and mentioned a discount we could use for the day, so my coworkers and I figured we'd give them a try. And...I was pretty underwhelmed. \n\nFor starters, a couple people definitely had problems ordering due to a poor connection or something like that. Fine. It happens. But then when our food eventually arrived the poor deliveryman told me that he had no idea how much my lunch cost. Fortunately, I'd gotten that info when I ordered. But what in the world did he plan on doing if I hadn't calculated my payment in advance? Would I have had to call in to sort out their staff's mistake? Would I have just handed the guy a random amount of money and waved him off? I have no idea.\n\nAnd the food itself certainly left a lot to be desired. I had ordered mozzarella sticks as an appetizer, but they did not impress me. The cheese was anything but gooey, and I ended up eating a couple sticks in one bite because the cheese simply wouldn't rip apart when I bit into it. The batter on the sticks also left a pretty bad aftertaste in my mouth, so much so that I chugged Coke after every bite to try to make up for it. \n\nAs for the sandwiches, my coworkers complained that their hoagies all came with too much mayo - one girl had even asked for her mayo to come on the side. No such luck: it came on her sandwich just like everyone else. As for me, the ranch I had asked to go with my buffalo chicken hoagie didn't even arrive. I used some from the company fridge. And the ranch was the only way I could eat the sandwich, which was drowning in buffalo sauce and could have been taken out of their toaster a lot sooner - entire sections of my sandwich's bread shouldn't break off when I bite into it, but that's what happens when you over toast something so badly...and is what happened here.\n\nI currently don't plan on ordering from this place again.

Came here for brunch on a Sunday because of an invite. You're not a member? Sorry no entry. Luckily, my accent gave it away and apparently Germans are always welcome.\n\nThey serve proper Bavarian food - Wurst, Bacon (?), Red Cabbage, fried potatoes - pretty solid. You can also get omelettes together with a Krug of German beer. Is that what we Germans do for breakfast back home? Maybe in the Bavarian woods, I'm not sure, but it is definitely something.\n\nThe interior is quite unique - imagine Oktoberfest in 1935 and you get the idea. Fun fact: not everyone in there speaks German and they have waitresses that work there for over a decade. I do, however, appreciate that this Pittsburgh institution is around for more than 100 years and hope they'll stick around for a while.\n\nMaybe, in another 100 years, even the neighborhood won't look as dodgy as it looks right now.", "type": "review", "business_id": "OjzR6hUYasFReo0vhVn0-w"}

I've had several of their offerings, including the Black Diamond Steak, a couple of the chicken dishes and the Steak Burger as well as a few appetizer offerings.

I know that sounds insane, but for reals, that Steak Burger blew my mind.  I never expected it to be so good.  I mean, I was just expecting your average burger.  Nope, once again Billy's impresses.  It's the perfect way to start a perfect night on the town.  \n\nThe service is always friendly and attentive, too, regardless of how busy they are.

Needless to say I refused to pay for them. The 4th time my friend dragged me there, I had a salad. I didn't get sick but it wasn't anything special with bagged salad mix and a couple of under ripe tomato pieces and cucumber. The last time I only got a slice of pie and this was good.

(Note to Yelp'er Mike O. from Park Ridge, IL--I didn't wipe out this time!).\n\nI decided to spend the entire day at the Carnegie, and believe me it was worth it!  As Emily H. says, the Dinosaurs in their time was really worth it!  It went from being a stuffy, dull, \"stuffed and mounted\" exhibit to being a really neat walk-through one.  The murals really give the exhibit a sense of time and place.  The exhibit shows how the plants, mammals, fish, and insects that surrounded them continue to evolve and create the biological diversity that surrounds us today.\n\nA long-time favorite of mine is the Hillman Hall of Minerals and Gems.  I've always loved the bright colors of the gems and could stand there for hours in hushed awe of these beautiful stones.  The museum just added the Wertz Gallery of Gems and Jewelry to the Hillman Hall.  The gallery has an extensive collection of birthstones, giving the history of each and how birthstones came to be.  The current special exhibit is the watches and timepieces from H.J. Heinz, including a stunning music box and watch piece.\n\nBut as much as I enjoy natural science, I really love art.  The Carnegie Museum of Art includes  American art from the late nineteenth century, French Impressionist and Post-Impressionist paintings, and European and American decorative arts.   The Heinz Architectural is dedicated to the collection, study, and exhibition of architectural drawings and models.  I particularly enjoy Asian art and the Carnegie has an extensive collection of Japanese prints.  \n\nOne special exhibit that I really recommend will be there only until October 18, 2008 and it is \"Abstract Art before 1950: Watercolors, Drawings, Prints, and Photographs\".  It consists of avant-garde works by European, American, and Japanese artists.  \n\nSo while the admission fee is $15.00, it does include both the Natural History Museum and the Museum of Art.  To get your money's worth, plan on staying a whole day.  I did and I still feel like I didn't see everything.", "type": "review", "business_id": "EEuGTah-oEssSl3o6pK-ZQ"}

The Carnegie Museums are scattered throughout the Pittsburgh area and include the Oakland Museums (highlighted here) as well as the Carnegie Science Museum and the Andy Warhol museum.  \n\nThis three building complex (the Museum of Art, Natural Science and History, and the Carnegie Library) sit on an entire city block, lined with sculptures of winged sirens, dinosaurs and literary legends.  Complimented by the lush Oakland landscape, right on the backdrop of the University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University, the locale delivers wonderful exhibitions across most mediums and provide a wonderful cultural and learning experience.   \n\nI recently visited the museum to see \"Horse,\" an exhibition in the history museum, depicting how this working animal has influenced human culture.  A VERY interesting and educational exhibit.  With one of the largest dinosaur collections in the world, you could literally spend an entire day in the History museum alone.   \n\nOver at the Art Museum (which joins through one hallway) The Scaiffe Galleries house works of Rodin, Monet, Klimt, Hopper and many others.  There's something there for everyone - paintings, etchings and sculpture.  And, don't miss the Hall of Art and Architecture.  This enourmous room houses casts of early Greek and Roman buildings, as well as church and mission facades' which cannot be matched.  \n\nIf you're in town for the Carnegie International, you're extra lucky.  As one of the largest annual art shows, the museum hand picks pieces from around the world, showcasing leading contemporary artists.  A must see.  \n\nThere is a cafe inside the museum, as well as a couple of gift shops. There are also several restaurants on Craig Street, adjacent to the museum.  There is paid parking next door to the Art museum.  Metered street parking is also available.  The museum is largely funded through the Carnegie Foundation, and has a huge donor program.

There was one film about migration in the modern art room which we both really enjoyed.  I found the art involving the venetian blinds and various types of light bulbs to be fascinating.

Anyway, my mom and I went to the Carnegie Museum of Art to see the exhibit, \"Read My Pins: The Madeleine Albright Collection\".  We went  on March 4, 2012 the day it closed.  O' but I'm so glad we saw it, albeit at the last minute!  \n\nMadeline Albright has always been one of  my favorite women in politics.  In 1997, Albright was named the first female Secretary of State and became, at that time, the highest ranking woman in the history of the U.S. government.  Prior to that, she was Ambassador to the U.N.  While serving under President Bill Clinton, first as U.S ambassador to the United Nations, and then as Secretary of State, Albright became known for wearing brooches that purposefully conveyed her views about the situation at hand.  She was famous for saying, \"While President George H.W. Bush had been known for saying 'Read my lips,' I began urging colleagues and reporters to 'Read my pins.'\"\n\nIn 1994, Saddam Hussein's government-controlled press referred to then-U.S. Ambassador to the UN Albright as an \"unparalleled serpent.\" She then wore a golden snake brooch to her next meeting on Iraq,  \n\nI was really quite enthralled by the collection that Secretary Albright cultivated.  As my guide says, \"The collection is distinctive and democratic-sometimes demure and understated, sometimes outlandish and outspoken-spanning more than a century of jewelry design and including fascinating pieces from across the globe.\"   Some of the pieces on display were fine antiques, such as the circa 1880 \"Blue Bird\".   But many of the pieces were costume jewelry.  \n\nI guess my favorite piece was \"Liberty Brooch\".  Now this piece, circa 1997 by Gijs Bakker, is the head of Lady Liberty with two watch faces for eyes, one of which is upside down-allowing both her and her visitor to see when it is time for an appointment to end.  A very clever piece, and judging by the others' comments at the exhibit, I'm not the only one with that opinion.  Mom really loved it too.  \n\nSo this was a really powerful exhibit of an eclectic collection of jewelry.  I strongly recommend reading the accompanying book, \"Read My Pins: Stories from a Diplomat's Jewel Box\", which you can get at Barnes & Noble or Amazon.  Madeleine Albright is an inspiration to women in politics and government.", "type": "review", "business_id": "EEuGTah-oEssSl3o6pK-ZQ"}

My favorite part is the Hall of Architecture, filled with many incredible casts of facades and sculptures. Just the fact that they have casts of the Venus de Milo and Nike of Samothrace is unbelieveable - I don't think that casting of these timeless works of art is even allowed anymore.

This museum was not only a huge part of my daughters' childhoods with at least 1 visit every summer, our youngest daughter got married there. The Carnegie Museum will hold a special place in our hearts forever! \n\nThe basic exhibits have been there since I did my school field trips (a loooong time ago!) and there have always been special rotating ones to check out and enjoy over the years. What one doesn't stop long enough to realize as you're schlepping kids from place to place is the amazing architecture of the building itself. That's what became so apparent as the wedding was taking place. The murals all around the walls and ceiling of the grand staircase area where the ceremony was held are spectacular, as well as the marble columns and staircases themselves. I had never had the opportunity to stand there and take it all in until that moment and it's pretty mind blowing how gorgeous everything truly is. \n\nThe 2 typical places for social events at the museum are The Hall of Architecture, where our reception was held, or the Carnegie Music Hall. Both are amazing event sites. Parkhurst Dining does the catering for events at the museum. Yes, it's the catering division of Eat N Park which initially gave us pause until we did their tasting and from that point on we had no worries. They produced really spectacular food elevated far above what one considers typical banquet fare. Everyone raved about their steaks being perfectly cooked and everything arrived hot to the tables. Alice, the baker, did a phenomenal job on the wedding cake, too. I'm not even a cake person and have to say that Alice's chocolate cake with raspberries was killer! \n\nAll the Greek and Roman Facades in the Hall of Architecture had always given me goose bumps when I walked in there over the years. Imagine it decorated for a reception! Truly unique and wonderful. \n\nThe Carnegie Museum is certainly a Pittsburgh treasure to be enjoyed on many levels both as kids and adults. And based on our experience, it's an unbelievably great place to host an event.", "type": "review", "business_id": "EEuGTah-oEssSl3o6pK-ZQ"}

The sauce was luxurious and packed with savory goodness.\n\nService was fun and family like, the meal ended with a complimentary piece of homemade fudge.\n\nMaybe this is not good for a 1st date but its good for a great meal or  a casual 4th date for when the food matters more than the looks.", "type": "review", "business_id": "q_BKmbdlYfQJroJVHfYMUQ"}

Although the physical structure and ambiance leave a bit to be desired. The food and staff surely make up for it!  The staff is always super friendly, even when you stroll in late in the evening a glass or two of wine into your night. \n\nThe food is all house made and truly delicious! The Virginia spots are one of my personal favorites. Honesty anything you try you'll be sure to love.\n\nIt is BYOB but beware of the corkage fee per person.", "type": "review", "business_id": "q_BKmbdlYfQJroJVHfYMUQ"}

There was way too much sauce and I guess I anticipated it to taste a bit more basily or something - it did say basil cream sauce, but what I got just seemed like a whole lotta tomato vodka sauce.  The spinach and ricotta didn't have much flavor, but perhaps that was due to my diminished lack of taste these few days with being sick.  All I could taste was the tomato sauce and that to me does not make a great or particularly good meal.  \n\nOh and to top it off the $4/person corkage fee is outrageous.", "type": "review", "business_id": "q_BKmbdlYfQJroJVHfYMUQ"}

It was okay....\n\nWhen a meal rocks my world, I usually want to lick the bowl clean, yes, like a dog.  I did not, sadly, feel that way about this place.  It IS BYOB but the catch is it's $4 PER glass.  Yep, that's right, not per table my friend.  Keep that in mind.\n\nI got the greens and beans on recommendation from many Yelpers on here.  Maybe I just don't have the taste for it, but I thought it was weird, watery and....not good.  I also thought it was going to be green beans and it was kidney beans and spinach that tasted like a warm Caesar salad.  No thanks....\n\nI ordered the Penne Vodka, which is my fav meal to order at Italian restaurants.  I also like to add a meatball on if it's homemade.  It was, in fact, confirmed to be homemade so I was all over it!  The meatball itself was delicious.  I love a bread-y meatball.  You know the type.  Soft and packed with flavor.  It was the winner of the night.  The vodka sauce was good, but I wanted way more.  Now I have to preface this by saying I'm a total sauce-aholic.  I love me a good amount of sauce, this didn't even come close.  Then I looked over at Serena R's plate, and her ravioli (which I thought was the same) was SWIMMING in it!  So I stole some of hers....\n\nWould I come back?  If someone really wanted to.  But I have a hunch there's way better Italian places to dine at in the Burgh...so now I'm on the hunt!  I gotta connect with my roots, ya' know?", "type": "review", "business_id": "q_BKmbdlYfQJroJVHfYMUQ"}
